10841638,"The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a significant public health concern in the United States. Most important are the effects of the virus on developing fetuses and immunocompromised individuals where it causes a variety of pathological conditions ranging in severity from mild to life-threatening. Since HCMV is present in a persistent or latent form in 50-90% of the world’s adult population, the identification of viral gene products and mechanisms that contribute to viral trafficking, persistence, and horizontal transmission is an intense and important area of investigation. We have recently generated and published an in vitro model for studying HCMV replication in primary salivary derived epithelial cells called “salispheres”. These salisphere cells express genes typical of salivary acinar epithelial cells, mimic the physiology of the salivary gland, and serve as a valuable model to understand the basic parameters and mechanisms underlying HCMV replication in the salivary epithelium. Our exciting preliminary data indicates that HCMV strains deficient for the pentamer glycoprotein complex can be rescued for infection of salivary cells using histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. Moreover, our preliminary data suggest that the pentamer may be required to induce nuclear mobilization of pp71, where it can interact with the HDACs, inhibit their activity, and facilitate lytic replication. We also present preliminary data indicating the viral encoded GPCRs (vGPCRs) are essential for replication in salivary cells and that pharmacological HDAC inhibition can similarly rescue the defect exhibited by vGPCR null viruses. Our data suggest novel roles for both HCMV pentamer and vGPCRs in facilitating lytic replication in salivary cells. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that the HCMV pentamer, vGPCRs, and pp71 work in concert to facilitate efficient viral replication in salivary epithelial cells leading to amplification and spread of virus from the salivary gland into the saliva. The proposed studies are highly significant to cytomegalovirus pathogenesis as the salivary gland and its secretions play an important role in horizontal transmission of virus, yet little is known about the viral mechanisms that facilitate infection and replication within the salivary epithelium. In aim 1, we will test whether the HCMV pentamer complex induces mobilization of the pp71 tegument protein into the nucleus to facilitate HDAC inhibition. In aim 2, we will test whether knockdown of HDAC1 or HDAC3 expression or overexpression of pp71 can rescue pentamer null viruses for efficient replication in salivary cells. In aim 3, we will determine whether HCMV vGPCR signaling works in concert with pentamer and pp71 to drive HCMV lytic replication in the salivary epithelial cells. The innovative experiments proposed in this application will generate important insight into the molecular and physiological properties of HCMV involved in salivary epithelial cell infection. Defining the mechanisms underlying salivary gland replication and spread could ultimately lead to the development of unique antivirals designed to prevent cytomegalovirus transmission via saliva."

Older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) have a 2-fold increased risk of clinical
bone fracture, and 33% higher rate of morbidity and mortality following fracture. Our prior study showed clinical
fractures were reduced by 18% among those prescribed an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AchEI). With both
cognitive and non-cognitive benefits, AchEIs such as donepezil would be valuable in a fracture prevention
program, for older adults with ADRD, with multiple complementary and synergistic components. However, the
pathways by which AchEIs reduce fracture risk represent a significant gap in knowledge. Before incorporating
AchEIs into a multicomponent program, the specific effects of AchEIs on bone metabolism must be understood.
The objective of this application is to measure the effect of ADRD treatment with AchEIs on fracture risk factors
including bone mineral density (BMD), bone turnover markers, and bone quality. Our central hypothesis is that
AchEIs reduce fracture risk through direct effects on bone metabolism via stimulation of osteoblastic bone
formation and reduction in osteoclastic bone resorption. We will recruit adults aged >50 years from the Memory
Disorders Clinic with mild to moderate ADRD (N = 45) who will be randomized 2:1 to either the AchEI donepezil
10 mg daily or placebo, respectively. From this biomarker-diagnosed cohort of older adults with mild to moderate
ADRD, we will address the following Specific Aims: 1) Determine change over 12-months in Bone Mineral
Density measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry associated with the initiation of donepezil; 2) Determine change
over 6- and 12-months in Bone Turnover measured by (A) the Bone Resorption Marker C-telopeptide (CTX) and
(B) the Bone Formation Marker Procollagen 1 intact N-terminal Pro-peptide (P1NP) associated with the initiation
of donepezil; 3) Determine change over 12-months in Bone Quality measured by Trabecular Bone Score
associated with the initiation of donepezil. In addressing this significant area, the current application focuses
on several NIA priorities including multiple comorbidities and care for adults with ADRD. The proposed study is
innovative in its comprehensive, prospective assessment of bone metabolism among adults with biomarker-
based diagnosis of ADRD initiating AchE."

Polysubstance use (PSU) is extremely common, with the majority of substance use treatment seekers reporting
the use of multiple substances. Not only is the prevalence of PSU high, but the consequences of PSU are also
thought to be worse than for individuals who use single substances. One of the most common substances to be
used with any other drug of abuse is nicotine. Marijuana and nicotine co-use is particularly common, with higher
overall incidence of marijuana use in the general population and up to 80% of marijuana users reporting that
they also use nicotine. Recent epidemiological studies indicate that the co-use of nicotine with THC containing
products is increasing and those that use both drugs at the same time have worse overall outcomes than those
individuals that consume both, but on separate occasions. Thus, there is a need to increase our understanding
of the neural mechanisms affected by interactions between nicotine and THC. In ongoing studies, we have
developed procedures for understanding how nicotine influences intravenous THC self-administration in rats.
We have found that nicotine acutely and reversibly enhances the amount of THC self-administered, and in
concurrent choice procedures have found that nicotine availability enhances acquisition of THC self-
administration and leads to preference for THC over nicotine. In the present proposal we aim to determine the
mechanisms by which nicotine enhances the reinforcing properties of THC and the consequences of concurrent
nicotine and THC self-administration on the function of dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area
(VTA). In aim 1 we will use dual-color fiber photometry in the VTA and nucleus accumbens shell (NAc shell) to
determine the effects of nicotine on THC-induced DA neuron activity and DA release. In aim 2, we will use the
concurrent choice procedure to determine if nicotine-enhanced THC self-administration is mediated via actions
at α7 and/or β2/4 subunit containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (NAchRs) using specific antagonists. We
will further determine if either antagonist affects nicotine-THC mediated changes in DA neuron activity or DA
release. Finally, in aim 3, we will use a novel method for performing cell-type specific, mass spectrometry-based,
proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis to determine the effects of nicotine-THC self-administration on DA
neuron function relative to either substance alone. Proximity labeling of proteins in DA neurons will be
accomplished through Cre-dependent viral expression of the APEX construct in TH-Cre rats. At the conclusion
of the proposed experiments, we will have determined: 1) if nicotine enhances the reinforcing effects of THC
through promotion of increased DA neuron activity and DA release in the NAc shell, 2) which NAchRs are
responsible for the enhanced reinforcement, and 3) what are the protein signaling consequences of co-self-
administration of the two substances on DA neuron function."
10910010,"A Convergent Bioengineered Platform for Multifunctional Therapeutic Exosomes
Abstract: The overall goal of this MIRA application is to develop a convergent bioengineered platform for
manufacturing and engineering therapeutic exosomes. The platform will allow the loading of drugs into exosomes
with high efficiency, biomanufacturing of exosomes in high throughput, and further engineering exosome-based
drug delivery systems for various diseases with desired functions including targeted delivery, tracking, and
combinational therapies. Exosomes are a subset of extracellular vesicles, with diameters between 50 nm and 150
nm, secreted by most eukaryotic cells. They are very promising drug delivery vehicles due to their small size,
biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, and reduced toxicity in comparison with synthetic nanoscale formulations
such as liposomes, dendrimers, and polymers. Delivery of anticancer drugs contained in exosomes demonstrated
improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and enhanced anticancer activity in vivo compared
to free drug molecules. Loading of therapeutic nucleic acids into exosomes protects the nucleic acids from
nucleases and increases cellular uptake and the therapeutic effect due to specific molecular mechanisms of
exosome internalization. Exosomes can cross the blood brain barrier and penetrate deep tissues with improved
efficacy compared to that of synthetic nanocarriers. Moreover, they play a key role in cancer metastasis and
regeneration by inducing transcriptomic and phenotypic changes with their RNA and protein cargoes. Therefore,
they can potentially be reengineered for delivery of gene and protein therapeutics. However, there remain
fundamental challenges to the utilization of exosomes in the clinic: i) drug loading efficiency into exosomes is
very limited; ii) the production of exosomes has yet to reach sufficiently high throughput for clinical tests or even
further development; and iii) endowing exosomes with multiple abilities for satisfactory disease targeting,
tracking and combinational therapies is highly demanding. To address these challenges, the PI proposes the
following three projects: 1) Developing a high-efficiency exosome drug loading technology with chiral graphene
nanoparticles; 2) Developing an exosome production bioreactor with stimulating piezoelectric nanofibrous
scaffolds; and 3) Engineering hybrid exosomes as a multifunctional targeted delivery system with targeting
ligands and functional chiral graphene quantum dots for near-infrared imaging-guided photothermal cancer
therapies. The proposed research contains several innovative approaches of exosome production, loading and
engineering that, if successful and integrated, will provide a high-throughput and high-efficiency exosome
manufacturing platform for drug delivery, and expand exosome-based drug delivery to diverse biomedical and
clinic applications by combining the merits of both the native exosomes and synthetic nanoparticles."

Given the importance of the gut microbiota to human health and disease, there is great interest in defining how
the indigenous microbes in these communities assemble and function in health. Ecological succession of the
microbes that compose the gut microbiome begins at birth, with diversification of the community throughout
human life. A key role for the gut microbiota is to break down resources from our available diet, which provides
us with necessary nutrition to live. This also sustains other surrounding microbes, increasing microbiota
diversity and resilience to environmental perturbation. In conjunction with the rich nutrients provided by the gut
environment, the ability of a bacterium to diversify its nutrient acquisition repertoire can allow for related strains
to establish new niches and coexist in a community. As such, niche partitioning among individual species or
strains likely to contributes to maintenance of a diverse microbiota. Niche partitioning of select model
commensal microbes of the gut, such as Bacteroides species, has been demonstrated, providing critical
knowledge about the cooperative and competitive interactions that contribute to their assembly in the gut. Yet,
we still lack comprehensive information about the metabolic strategies for many prevalent species in the gut,
let alone how these species interact together to maintain a particular community structure. Understanding how
non-model microbes assemble in the gut is important, as successful implementation of many targeted bacterial
functions still rely on their surrounding community members. In this proposal, we aim to characterize the
metabolic role of commensal Clostridia, which represent prevalent members of the gut microbiota that are
under-characterized. We hypothesize that similar to what is known about more well-defined gut commensal
species, nutrient niche partitioning among Clostridial species is essential to sustaining their diversity in the gut.
We will use bioinformatic and in vitro methods to 1) characterize the fundamental (genonme-encoded) and
realized (expressed) metabolic strategies used by select Clostridial species and 2) identify how these
contribute to their assembly in the gut. Results from these data provide critical information about core
functions, strain heterogeneity, and microbial interactions that are relevant to understanding comprehensive
assembly of the human gut microbiota. These data provide a foundation for mechanistic studies surrounding
commensal Clostridia in the gut, such as developing rational bacterial consortia or dietary interventions based
on these fundamental characteristics. Overall, this proposal provides a path forward for our independent
research program focused on understanding the role of commensal Clostridia in health."

For this application, “Mendelian imputation for family-based GWAS and association-by-proxy in diverse
ancestries,” we propose to develop methods to enable more powerful estimation of family-based genome-
wide association studies (GWASs) and apply these methods to a wide range of health, disease, and aging
phenotypes in diverse populations. In brief, we propose to:
 · Meta-analyze family-based GWAS summary statistics on 30 phenotypes from 14 cohorts of
 predominantly European ancestry. In addition, through collaboration with the China Kadoorie Biobank
 and 23andMe, we will perform family-based GWAS in a set of diverse ancestries. Using the summary
 statistics, we will test within- and cross-ancestry prediction using polygenic indexes (PGIs, also called
 polygenic scores) derived from family-based and standard GWAS summary statistics, enabling us to
 determine the role of confounding in the drop in predictive accuracy of PGIs across ancestries. We will
 investigate methods that combine standard GWAS summary statistics and family-based GWAS
 summary statistics to improve polygenic prediction across ancestries.
 · Boost the power of family-based GWAS by adding genotyped individuals without any close relatives to
 the estimation sample. We will derive analytical formulas that can be used to quantify the efficiency
 gains in specific settings. We will develop an efficient linear mixed model algorithm that simultaneously
 performs standard- and family-based GWAS, maximizing power for both. Preliminary results from UK
 Biobank indicate this method results in an increase in effective sample size for estimation of direct
 genetic effects of between 30 and 40%.
· Increase power for association-by-proxy methods by imputing relatives’ genotypes. Theory shows that
 power for discovery of associations could be increased when the genotype of the un-genotyped relative
 is imputed to give a more accurate estimate of the relative’s genotype. We will apply the methods to
 phenotypes available for UK Biobank participants’ parents, including Alzheimer’s disease and longevity.
· Extend the algorithm for imputing parental genotypes to diverse populations and additional relatives.
 We will develop an algorithm that uses a diverse haplotype reference panel as the basis of pedigree-
 based imputation. In addition to removing bias from imputation in diverse samples, our approach will
 generalize the imputation algorithm to include relatives other than full-siblings and parents, thereby
 increasing imputation accuracy and power of downstream family-based genetic association analyses.
The software for implementing the methods will be made publicly available on a GitHub repository. The
summary statistics will be made publicly available to the maximum extent consistent with data use agreements."
10900607,"[Fasting hyperglycemia in diabetes mellitus (DM) is caused by unregulated hepatic gluconeogenesis (GNG), and
the associated hyperinsulinemia promotes fatty acid (FA) and triglyceride (TAG) synthesis. Importantly the more
common, insulin-resistant form of DM (T2DM) is less prevalent in women, even after controlling for obesity.
Increased glucagon signaling, insulin resistance, and altered substrate availability have been offered as
explanations, but the lack of correlation between hepatic gene expression and metabolic pathway function has
hindered mechanistic progress. Understanding these limitations, our laboratories are uniquely positioned to
study and integrate sex-specific differences in transcriptional regulation of GNG and lipogenic genes with direct
measurement of metabolic pathways using 13C tracing and flux analyses. The overall hypothesis: glycerol
metabolism is sex-dependent and crucial for both hepatic GNG and lipid metabolism. Several recent or
new observations support this hypothesis: 1) Glycerol supplies the majority of the carbons for glucose and
lactate synthesis in vivo. 2) Glycerol promotes its own conversion to glucose by simultaneously activating G6PC
and inhibiting PCK1 expression. 3) E2 dramatically suppresses GK expression and glucose production from
glycerol in primary hepatocytes (PHs) derived from ovariectomized mice. 4) Hepatic G3-P levels are low in liver-
specific insulin receptor (Ir) and glycerol kinase (Gk) KO mice, demonstrating GK’s critical role in generating G3-
P for GNG and TAG synthesis. 5) Liver-specific Gk KO eliminates glycerol as a GNG substrate, dramatically
reducing total glucose production, hepatic expression of GNG and lipogenic genes and HFD-induced steatosis.
6) Glycerol metabolism increases the level of P300, a transcriptional co-activator and key regulator of hepatic
function. Three specific aims are proposed: Aim 1 To characterize sex-dependent utilization of glycerol in obesity
and T2DM mouse models. Employing obesity and T2DM models, estradiol (E2) depletion and replacement
models, and a liver estrogen receptor KO model, we will study GNG substrate use in female and male mice
using 13C labeled substrate infusions. Hypothesis: Glycerol use in GNG is sex-dependent and increased in
obesity and T2DM. Aim 2 To determine the mechanism(s) by which glycerol regulates glucagon-stimulated GNG.
Glycerol’s critical importance for glucose production in PHs suggests that mechanisms based on data obtained
from PHs cultured in the absence of glycerol may be incorrect. Hypothesis: Glycerol augments glucagon-
stimulated GNG by increasing G6pc gene expression while limiting PCK1 expression and substrates entering
the lower GNG pathway. Aim 3 To determine how GK expression regulates hepatic GNG and lipid metabolism.
We will study how insulin stimulates, and E2 suppresses GK expression, the former exacerbating and the latter
mitigating hyperglycemia, elevated GNG, and hepatic steatosis. Hypothesis: Insulin and E2 regulate glycerol use
as both a substrate for GNG and triglyceride synthesis and as a nutritional factor stimulating co-activator (P300)
expression and regulating both GNG and lipogenesis transcription.]"

Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) are common in patients on
maintenance hemodialysis (HD) and contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality in this vulnerable patient
population. Although strategies to decrease these adverse outcomes exist, the lack of accurate and actionable
predictive risk models has led to overall low and non-targeted utilization of these strategies.
Electrocardiography (ECG) is ubiquitous, cheap, simple to perform, and it provides an immediately accessible,
non-invasive insight into cardiovascular reflexes and health. The raw waveform data can be leveraged by
advanced deep learning for accurate determination of various cardiac features as well as prognostication of
key outcomes. In our prior published work, we demonstrated the utility of deep learning to determine both right
and left heart function and the utility of transfer learning to improve outcome prediction in patients on HD. In
recent preliminary analysis, we also show utility of waveform data to predict in hospital IDH and association
with 30-day mortality using retrospective data. However, prospective development and validation on IDH and
MACE are critical to clinical deployment. Thus, extending our prior work, we propose the largest prospective
study on utilizing ECGs for prediction of key outcomes in patients on HD. We will recruit 1000 diverse patients
on HD from dialysis units in New York City (derivation) and 150 patients from North Carolina (validation) and
obtain standard duration, 12-lead ECGs at baseline and 4 weeks after baseline. In addition, a subset of
participants will undergo continuous waveform monitoring during 3 consecutive HD sessions in an exploratory
sub-study. We will then use deep learning and transfer learning (using pre-trained models from our
approximately 11 million archival ECG database) and use this to predict IDH at the same session and within 30
days (Aim 1) and a composite outcome of MACE at 1 year of follow up (Aim 2). The results of this proposal
are of high clinical importance for the prediction of both short- and long-term cardiac outcomes. Positive results
will prompt studies testing deployment of our predictive models into HD units for detection and prevention of
IDH and MACE as well use of novel wearables for IDH and cardiac risk prediction."
10851821,"Background: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a common and highly morbid condition. Nearly 25% of patients
die within 3 years of diagnosis, likely due to a high incidence of cardiovascular (CV) events: myocardial infarction
(MI) or stroke. A significantly larger proportion experience disability due to leg pain, poor mobility and amputation.
The cost of PAD-related hospital care alone exceeds $21 billion. However, research regarding long-term survival,
CV, and limb outcomes in PAD and the impact of existing treatments remain limited in large part due to the poor
accuracy of PAD diagnosis codes. Our team has developed a novel approach using natural language processing
(NLP) to identify PAD patients with a high degree of accuracy within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).
Significance: The Peripheral Artery Disease: Long-term Survival & Outcomes Study (PEARLS) study will
advance scientific knowledge for PAD in several ways. Using our novel NLP tool to identify Veterans with PAD,
we will examine the trajectory of long-term survival and clinical outcomes, evaluate utilization of recommended
treatments (medications, risk factor control and revascularization) and the association of above treatments with
the above outcomes. We will also examine disparities in PAD care and outcomes by race and ethnicity and
determine the extent to which these disparities our due to access in high quality care. Collectively, our work will
address important gaps in PAD research and yield insights for improving care delivery in this high-risk population.
Innovation: The use of an informatics-based method to assemble a cohort of newly diagnosed PAD patients in
a large integrated health system is highly innovative. We believe that our approach for cohort identification will
be transformational and promote big data analytics for research, improving care delivery, and future clinical trials.
Specific Aims: A1. Examine the trajectory of long-term outcomes of PAD and assess racial and ethnic
disparities. A2. Examine patterns of medical and invasive management of PAD in the Veterans Health
Administration A3. Determine the association of medical and invasive management with long-term outcomes
Methodology: We will implement our NLP algorithm to identify patients with new PAD diagnosis in VHA during
2015-2020 and obtain data on clinical and treatment related variables. We will follow our cohort longitudinally for
mortality, CV events (MI, stroke) and limb events (amputation). We will examine utilization of PAD treatments
and risk factor control, identify patient-level and hospital-level predictors of treatment using multi-level models.
We will use marginal structural models to evaluate the association of PAD treatments with long-term outcomes.
Implementation/Next Steps: Key deliverables will include a) an assessment of long-term outcomes in PAD and
identifying racial disparities in care and outcomes; (b) determining the relative impact of PAD treatments on long-
term outcomes which can be useful for decision-making and c) an assessment of site-level variation in treatment
patterns. We envision that our findings will help us develop comprehensive disease management program to
improve quality of care and reduce disparities in use of effective treatments."

The long-term goal of this project is to define the interactions within transcription elongation complexes and
with regulators that cause and control pausing and termination by RNA polymerase. Pausing and premature
termination underlie many aspects of gene regulation in diverse prokaryotes and eukaryotes, including
transcription through chromatin and linkages to RNA maturation and translation. Both the basic mechanisms
of pausing and termination and the mechanisms by which regulators control pausing and termination depend
on poorly understood changes to interactions within the elongation complex. Many of these interactions
modulate conformational changes in RNA polymerase involving mobile modules including the clamp, trigger
loop, and lineage-specific insertions that must achieve particular conformations for efficient transcription.
Understanding how regulators promote or inhibit these different conformations in diverse bacteria will provide
key basic knowledge essential to guide the rational manipulation of regulators for antimicrobials or genetic
therapies. Knowledge gained about diverse bacterial systems also helps define highly conserved mechanisms of
transcription in humans. Additionally, bacterial RNA polymerases are known target of antibiotics, and
knowledge about their functional mechanisms will aid in identifying and characterizing new antibiotics.
 A combination of structural, biochemical, and genetic approaches will be used to characterize the interac-
tions in the elongation complex that mediate regulation. New methods for transcription assay by cryo-electron
microscopy, for single-molecule assay of RNA polymerase interactions with RNA structures, regulators, and
ribosomes, and for genome-scale analysis of chromatin structure and elongation complex regulation will be
developed. This combination of approaches will be used to understand connections among progress of the
elongation complex during transcription, the structure of bacterial chromatin, RNA folding, and RNA
translation. The work builds on recent discoveries of the structural basis by which RNA polymerase pauses, of
the role of H-NS family nucleoprotein filaments in stimulating pausing and termination during transcriptional
silencing, and of the different actions of the only universal transcription elongation regulator, NusG. The
specific aims of the project are to (i) integrate models of pausing and termination mechanisms across diverse
bacterial lineages; (ii) elucidate the molecular basis of pro- vs. anti-pausing and recruitment for NusGs and
paralogs; and (iii) link genome-scale regulation in vivo to the molecular basis of elongation complex structural
changes. This integrated research will help build a new understanding of transcriptional regulation by defining
how pause and termination signals change elongation complex structure and activity dynamically across
evolutionarily diverse microbes. The impact of these studies will be an improved understanding of elongation

 Proteins often fold into three-dimensional shapes and operate as cellular machines with well-defined
reaction mechanics – hence the common biochemical expression “structure is function.” However, this rule
only applies to the slowest evolving portions of the human genome. Proteins that evolve more rapidly are
typically less ordered, both enabling their accelerated evolution and expanding the biochemical landscape on
which natural selection may act. Currently there exist few tools and conceptual frameworks to understand the
sequence-function relationship of quickly evolving dynamical proteins. Across the tree of life, reproductive
proteins evolve at extraordinary rates – typically faster than immune genes – and the Wilburn lab studies the
biophysics and molecular evolution of species-specific fertilization in animals. The continuous coevolution of
interacting sperm and egg proteins has selected for biochemical properties such as intrinsic disorder, weak
binding affinities, etc. that complicate their study. High-field NMR spectroscopy is unique among structural
methods in its ability to study such heterogenous protein systems, and I have pioneered NMR studies of
fertilization proteins in a classic model of fertilization research (marine abalone). Over the next 5 years, we will
interrogate the sequence-to-function relationships of gamete recognition proteins important for species-specific
fertilization by pairing high throughput mutagenesis screens with targeted biophysical analyses to better
understand the complex interplay of molecular dynamics with protein evolvability and interaction kinetics. NMR
methods will be expanded to the study of mammalian fertilization proteins. To facilitate our own work and
empower other researchers, deep learning-based analytical tools in evolutionary genomics, mass spectrometry
proteomics, and NMR dynamics will be developed. The proposed research will provide an evolutionary
framework to better understand the breadth of protein biochemistry encoded by the human genome, and
includes diverse training opportunities for undergraduate, graduate students, and postdocs"
10849876,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chemotherapy-related cardiotoxicity leading to heart failure is a major issue in the treatment of breast cancer
and lymphoma patients, who are three times more likely to get heart failure than controls. Cumulative dose of
the anthracycline chemotherapy, doxorubicin, is strongly associated with increased risk of heart failure, such
that patients are limited to a lifetime cumulative dose, even if the therapy is still needed. Doxorubicin is
commonly used for treatment of lymphoma and high risk breast cancers, (triple negative and HER2+ breast
cancer). Unfortunately, prediction of which cancer patients are at risk of heart failure is poor and current
cardioprotective therapies are limited. Our published genetic studies have identified TRPC6 as a risk locus for
doxorubicin-induced heart failure. Our studies of ipsc-derived cardiomyocytes and a mouse model of
doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy showed that therapeutic inhibition of TRPC6 and TRPC6 knock-out are
protective against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Our preliminary studies and those of others suggest that
inhibition of TRPC6 may also have anti-tumor properties. The overall scientific premise of this project is that
genetic variants at TRPC6 and other known and novel loci, significantly increase patient risk of cardiotoxicity.
Determination of these variants and better understanding of their mechanisms of action will allow individualized
risk stratification and mitigation of chronic heart failure. To determine genetic risk variants of dox-related
cardiotoxicity and new cardioprotective strategies for at-risk patients, we will: 1. Diversify our existing
cardiotoxicity biorepository at Mayo Clinic Florida by extending to Mayo Clinic Arizona, The University of
Florida Jacksonville and Moffitt Cancer Center, performing exome sequencing of these newly enrolled patients
and meta-analyses of top hits with additional large and diverse datasets. 2. Define the mechanistic basis of
TRPC6 gain-of-function and interaction with other doxorubicin-induced toxicity pathways. 3. Assess the
efficacy and cardioprotection of TRPC6 inhibitors in a tumorigenic mouse model analogous to triple negative
breast cancer."

Columbia University is uniquely positioned to provide advanced dual training of the next generation of dental
scientists in dentistry and biomedical engineering, to prepare them to lead the transformation of the daily practice
of dentistry towards personalized and precision treatments. Through strategic investment over the last 10 years,
Columbia University has become the place for biomedical engineering research training of dentists. The College
of Dental Medicine (CDM) has created a new 15,000 sq ft Center for Precision Dentistry that transforms the
traditional dental practice into a digitalized hub that tracks clinical activities in real time. Each of the 48
operatories is able to track patients, providers and dental instruments usage and location. In addition, Columbia
CDM is one of the first schools in the country to fully integrate dental and medical electronic records through
EPIC, which provides an integrated patient’s health record. Moreover, the Department of Biomedical
Engineering (DBME), established in 2000, has quickly risen to become one of the top 10 ranked graduate
programs in Biomedical Engineering, and leads the nation in funding per faculty, with renowned strength in
foundational areas (bioimaging, biomaterials, biomechanics) as well as in frontier research areas (cell and tissue
engineering, neuroengineering, synthetic biology and deep learning). We propose here a new Dental-
Biomedical Engineering Scholars Training (D-BEST) Program that brings together leading biomedical
engineering researchers and dental clinicians and scholars at Columbia University. This unique dual-degree
DDS/PhD training program will integrate dental and biomedical engineering research training of dental
scientists in four key thematic areas: 1) Stem Cells and Regenerative Engineering, 2) Craniofacial Imaging and
Biomechanics, 3) Big Data and Deep Learning for Dental Diagnostics, and 4) Detection and Modeling of Oral
Diseases. The two tracks of D-BEST are (i) Pre-Doc – an 8-year dual degree program in dentistry (DDS) and
in Biomedical Engineering (PhD), and (ii) Post-Doc – post-doctoral research training in biomedical engineering
to US or foreign trained dentists. Over the 5 years, we plan to have 24 pre-doctoral slots and 7 post-doctoral
slots with each trainee staying on the grant for 3 years. In addition to the highly successful Summer Health
Professions Education Program (SHPEP), we are partnering with the School of Dental Medicine at Ponce Health
Sciences University in Puerto Rico to enhance the diversity of the trainee pool and ensure participation of
trainees from traditionally under-represented groups in the D-BEST program. This new T90/R90 training program
will provide a unique opportunity to promote, enhance, and deepen multidisciplinary dental research. Our long-
term goal, above and beyond this 5-year grant, is to continue with a productive and sustainable program for this
integrated training of dental scientists, with expertise rooted in both engineering and dental sciences. It is

Pre-menopausal women display a significantly lower incidence of cardiovascular disease than age-matched
men. However, the incidence of female cardiovascular disease increases markedly after the onset of
menopause, resulting in a relative loss of protection from heart disease. Decreased levels of estrogen are
closely linked to the loss of cardioprotection after menopause, but the biological mechanisms underlying this
connection are incompletely understood. While we know that estrogen signaling mediates the response to
various pathophysiological stimuli, we do not fully understand how estrogen regulates key metabolic pathways
in the failing heart. In the current proposal, we seek to understand whether relative reductions in cardiac fatty
acid oxidation underpin the loss of cardioprotection in post-menopausal female hearts. In Specific Aim 1, we
will determine how estrogen controls the abundance of GCN5L1, an enzyme that regulates cardiac fatty acid
oxidation. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine how GCN5L1 regulates cardiac fatty acid oxidation in mouse
models of female menopause. In Specific Aim 3, we will determine the requirement for fatty acid oxidation in
female cardioprotection."

 Maintaining a stable brain vascular network is crucial for ensuring overall brain health throughout life.
Perivascular cells, like pericytes and smooth muscle cells, are crucial to maintain the integrity of the brain
vasculature. Loss of pericytes and smooth muscle cells are noted in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and affects
vascular integrity, ultimately contributing to disease pathology. Perivascular fibroblasts (PVFs) are another cell
population along the brain vasculature, however their role is largely unknown. PVFs express numerous
extracellular matrix proteins that are uniquely found on arterioles and venules but not capillaries. My preliminary
investigations indicate that PVFs maintain vessel structural stability, particularly along arterioles, in the healthy
brain. Further, I find that arterioles are more tortuous in a mouse model of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA),
and this is associated with a significant reduction in PVFs. CAA is a small vessel disease characterized by the
accumulation of amyloid- on vessels commonly observed in AD. Arterioles and their immediate off-shoots are
important major regulators of blood flow into the brain. In doing so, they undergo extensive dilation and
constriction events which is likely supported in part by extracellular matrix proteins expressed by PVFs. The goal
of this proposal is to determine if PVFs regulate arteriole structure and dynamics in the healthy brain.
Further, my goal is to understand if CAA contributes to PVF loss, altering arteriole structure and
dynamics by affecting the expression of extracellular matrix proteins, ultimately exacerbating CAA.
Understanding these important aspects of the brain vasculature could ultimately provide a potential for
developing therapeutics aimed at limiting AD pathology and improve vascular function.
 The training I will receive under the guidance of Dr. Andy Shih, who is an expert in in vivo imaging and brain
vascular physiology in health and disease, will enable me to achieve the goals of this proposal. My training is
further supported by my advisory committee, consisting of Drs. Steven Greenberg, Richard Daneman, and
Timothy Cherry who will enhance my training by providing guidance in CAA clinical pathology, PVF pathobiology
and single-cell transcriptomics, respectively. Upon completion of these studies, I will have gained extensive
knowledge of in vivo imaging, complex vascular physiology and single-cell transcriptomic approaches, in addition
to PVF biology in heath and CAA pathology. These foundational studies and techniques are crucial components
of my proposed independent phase described in this application and will propel my future goals of running an
independent research group studying small vessel diseases in the brain. Further, with the support of Dr. Shih,
my advisory committee, and the faculty at Seattle Children’s Research Institute in the Center of Developmental
Biology and Regenerative Medicine, I will have expanded my experience in scientific communication,
grantsmanship, networking, and mentorship. By continuing to strengthen these crucial skills during my training
phase I will be well poised to guide a successful research group of my own."

Cerebral white matter abnormalities predict the development of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia
(VCID). Vascular mechanisms, including cerebral hypoperfusion, underly white matter abnormalities.
However, the mechanisms leading to white matter dysfunction and cognitive performance remain poorly
understood limiting the development of effective treatments. Using human post-mortem tissues and studies
in animal models, we have shown that key mechanisms that damage white matter include disruption of
microglia homeostasis, endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction, blood brain barrier (BBB) breakdown and chronic
low-grade microvascular inflammation. Our studies now provide compelling support that microglia ‘state’
(abundance/function) influence white matter abnormalities via interactions with ECs. Our emerging data also
show microglia states respond to reduced microvascular cerebral blood flow (CBF) in a spatially-dependent
manner. Bulk analysis of white matter and grey matter-microglia implicates white matter microglial sensitivity
warranting more in-depth investigation of compartment-related diversity. Further our novel data indicate
microglia may be critical regulators of microvascular tone and hemodynamics. We will build on this work to
test the hypothesis that specific regulators of microglia state influence microglia-microvascular EC
homeostasis and the development and progression of WM abnormalities and cognitive deficits in
VCID. Our cross-disciplinary team (Edinburgh, Newcastle, Sussex (UK)) with expertise in neuroimmune
mechanisms, myelin and vascular biology will bridge animal model to patient. We will use specialised
spatial transcriptomic approaches, imaging modalities and computational approaches to provide a
comprehensive insight to the microglial diversity and how it affects microvascular and white matter alterations
in VCID. The following key aims would be undertaken:
 Aim 1: To identify microglia-microvascular EC heterogeneity and intercellular communication in relation
 to WM abnormalities in human VCID
 Aim 2: To determine if specific regulators of microglia state can improve microglia -microvascular EC
 homeostasis and prevent WM disease progression in a model of VCID
 Aim 3: To provide functional insight to microglia-microvascular interactions, in real time, in relation to
 WM disease progression in a model of VCID.
These studies will provide a critical foundation to define how microglia state influences microglia-EC cross
talk and white matter integrity in VCID, also of relevance to Alzheimer’s disease. The goal is to identify novel
immunomodulatory targets for early therapeutic intervention to attenuate cognitive decline."
10861855,"Project Summary/Abstract
Pain management in craniofacial pathology is a major clinical challenge. Although many people suffer from
chronic inflammatory pain caused by a temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJD) and other chronic oral and
facial diseases, there is no effective treatment. Our previous study demonstrated that lipid mediators derived
from omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids such as resolvin E1 (RvE1) were effective in inhibiting inflammatory
pain by regulating TRPV1. However, it is unclear whether RvE1 can inhibit TMJ pain in the trigeminal nervous
system, the role of its receptor ChemR23, and its relevance to clinical translation.
We found from preliminary data that ChemR23 is co-expressed with TRPV1 using the ATAC-Seq database,
RvE1 was decreased in the TMJ-CFA model using ELISA detection, and RvE1 can reduce TMJ pain using the
biting force method. Based on this, we suggest that a RvE1/ChemR23 signaling pathway resolves TMJ pain by
suppressing TRPV1 function.
In Aim1, we predict that the RvE1/ChemR23 pathway will be downregulated during the TMJ-CFA model. To
address our hypothesis, we will examine measuring of change of RvE1 level in TMJ-tissue, TGs, saliva, and
serum in TMJ-CFA mice to confirm whether RvE1 can affect pain using the ELISA method. And we will test the
ChemR23 expression level change and TRPV1 binding activity in TGs using western blot after the generation of
the TMJ-CFA model. We will measure how much ChemR23 is expressed in TMJ-innervated TG in the TMJ-CFA
model using flow cytometry.
In Aim2, we will investigate the mechanism of pain suppression through ChemR23/TRPV1 through animal
behavioral experiments. To know the RvE1 can block the TRPV1-induced pain in TG, we will cause acute
trigeminal pain by injecting TRPV1 agonist capsaicin into the whisker pad. In addition, we will use unilateral CFA
injection to the TMJ to test the hypothesis that RvE1 inhibits TMJ pain via ChemR23. To that end, we'll use local
whisker pads or TMJ injections of the AAV1 virus to reduce ChemR23 expression in TG neurons.
In Aim3, we will examine whether ChemR23 and TRPV1 mechanisms can be applied to human sensory neurons
through Co-IP assay and real-time PCR using Human DRG and TG provided by Co-I. We will compare the
differences in expression levels and Co-IP activity of DRGs and TGs.
We propose a novel molecular mechanism for the resolution of tertiary pain where RvE1-induced ChemR23
activation can inhibit TRPV1 signaling. If completed, including future directions, this proposal will provide a new
path for TMJ pain control. It will enable the development of new drugs aimed at TMJ and broaden our
understanding of the disease. And this proposal can provide fundamental data for future research, such as
investigating the role of additional resolvins and other TRP channels in human serum and chronic animal models."
10910149,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Learning and executing motor skills are crucial functions of the brain and involve the coordinated activity of
multiple brain regions. Traditionally, the motor cortex (MCtx), the basal ganglia (BG), and the cerebellum (CB)
have been considered key motor control regions of the brain, and plasticity within these regions are known to
support motor learning. In addition, neuromodulation, such as from adrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus
(LC), is critical for proper behavior and learning. Despite the key role these regions play in controlling
movements and their implication in movement disorders, we are only beginning to understand how motor
signals from these regions interact with each other. Anatomically, the thalamus serves as a common target
structure for MCtx, BG, and CB, yet conventionally, the thalamus has been viewed as a passive relay station.
However, there is emerging evidence that the thalamus can functionally integrate and modulate these diverse
motor signals. How thalamic neurons respond to motor inputs, the role of motor thalamus in motor learning,
and how adrenergic signaling modulates thalamic activity are largely undefined. My central hypothesis is that
the motor thalamus serves as a point of convergence for motor signals from MCtx, BG, and CB, as well as
neuromodulatory input from LC, allowing it to functionally integrate these inputs to control movements and
promote motor learning. I propose to use a combination of in vivo deep-brain imaging and novel fluorescent
sensors for intracellular signaling in mice performing motor tasks, as well as slice electrophysiology, to
measure the activity of motor thalamus during movement and determine how such activity is modulated by
adrenergic input from LC. These approaches will allow me to define the inputs to motor thalamus and measure
thalamic activity during movement and motor learning (Aim 1), determine the functional role of motor thalamus
and its inputs in motor control (Aim 2), and determine how adrenergic signaling modulates thalamic activity
during motor learning (Aim 3). Results from this study will not only clarify the role of the motor thalamus in
motor control and motor learning but also provide an understanding of how adrenergic neuromodulation
influences thalamic activity during behavior. This is of critical importance, as abnormal thalamic activity and
disrupted adrenergic signaling are characteristic features of motor diseases. The experiments proposed in this
study will span the mentored K99 and independent R00 phase of this award, with the K99 phase being focused
on defining the activity and role of motor thalamus during motor learning and the R00 phase focused on
understanding how adrenergic input to the thalamus modulates motor signals. My proposed training plan builds
on my experience in two-photon in vivo imaging and mouse behaviors and will add training in slice
electrophysiology. In addition, my expert mentoring team will also provide guidance in my career development
with the goal of launching a successful career as independent investigator at a research institution."
10929458,"Colon cancers develop by stepwise accumulation of oncogenic mutations in epithelial stem
cells. These mutated stem cells multiply by positive selection in healthy colon for years before
transforming into cancers. In this proposal I aim to unravel an immune surveillance mechanism
that prevents selection of mutated stem cells in healthy colon. Colon cancers with BRAFV600E
mutation involve the proximal colon and disproportionately affect women above the age of 65
years. Based on the unique anatomic and demographic distribution of these cancers, I propose
that BRAFV600E mutated stem cells have a strong selective advantage in the proximal colon.
Regulatory T cells are part of the colonic stem cell microenvironment and, also heavily infiltrate
BRAFV600E mutated cancers. Thus, I hypothesize that the regulatory T cells recognize and
suppress the selection of BRAFV600E mutated stem cells in the healthy colon. To test this
hypothesis, I have developed several genetically inducible lineage tracing mice that specifically
induce BRAFV600E mutation in a single colonic stem cell. Using these mice, I will dissect the
molecular mechanisms employed by regulatory T cells to perform surveillance against
BRAFV600E mutated stem cells. Establishing the role of regulatory T cells in oncogene
selection will lead to development of immune-prevention therapies against colon cancers. The
proposal also includes a rigorous training program under the guidance of mentors with expertise
in tumor immunology, stem cell biology and cancer evolution. Completion of the proposed
activities will help me realize my goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist,
investigating immune preventive strategies against colon cancer."

 This is a K08 award application for Dr. Eileen Hwang, a licensed vitreoretinal surgeon, to independently
conduct research studies to identify mechanisms of vitreous aging. The K08 will provide her the support
necessary to acquire critical skills in four key career development areas: 1) rabbit models of posterior vitreous
detachment; 2) cell-matrix interactions and mechanics; 3) quantitative image analysis; and 4) translational
research leadership. To achieve her goals, Dr. Hwang has assembled an interdisciplinary mentoring team
comprised of Dr. Brittany Coats (Primary Mentor), an expert in vitreous mechanics, and two Co-Mentors: Dr.
Paul Bernstein, an internationally recognized researcher of retinal biochemistry, and Dr. Bryan Jones, a
pioneer in retinal connectomics. Complementing these mentors, Dr. Hwang also has a 3 member advisory
committee to support her goal of developing models and methods for investigating vitreous aging.
 Retinal detachment leads to significant morbidity and impacts on quality of life, and new strategies for
prevention in high-risk individuals are necessary. There is a critical need to elucidate the mechanisms of
posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), the primary cause of retinal detachment. Dr. Hwang's objective is to
address the gaps in current knowledge about vitreous structure and aging. Her research will result in
preliminary data and models to support future proposals investigating whether biological manipulation of
vitreous structure can affect PVD in rabbit models. She proposes the following Specific Aims: Aim 1] Identify
the effect of decreasing type IX collagen on vitreous structure; Aim 2] Determine the role of hyalocytes in
vitreous aging; and Aim 3] Establish the relationships between eye motion, structural heterogeneity, and PVD.
 The proposed research is significant because it will: 1) determine whether age-related loss of type IX
collagen and increased hyalocyte degradation are pathways that could be blocked to prevent PVD and prevent
retinal detachment in high risk individuals, and 2) develop cell culture and animal models of vitreous aging to
enable mechanistic and therapeutic studies. The proposed research is innovative because it will apply cellular
and molecular specificity to inhibit PVD."
10894027,"As SARS-CoV-2 continues to wreak havoc across the globe, it is imperative to understand the mechanism and
regulation of the viral genome replication and transcription, which are essential processes in coronavirus life
cycle and represent important targets for therapeutic interventions. Coronavirus genome replication and
transcription are carried out by a dynamic replication-transcription complex (RTC), assembled from an array of
viral non-structural proteins (nsps). Within the RTC, a unique proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN) complex,
nsp14-nsp10, boosts replication fidelity by excising mis-incorporated nucleotides and many antiviral nucleotide
analogs. In addition to its role in proofreading viral RNA synthesis, the ExoN complex is also involved in viral
RNA 5′ capping, which is critical for immune evasion by coronaviruses. Despite extraordinary efforts in studying
coronavirus biology and replication, major gaps remain in our understanding of the key roles ExoN complex
plays in various fundamental aspects of coronavirus life cycle. First, it is unclear how ExoN complex coordinates
with the low-fidelity viral polymerase to proofread RNA synthesis. Second, it is poorly understood how ExoN
complex is modulated by viral cofactors. Third, it is unknown how the two different enzymatic functions, RNA
cleavage and capping activities, of ExoN complex are coupled in the virus life cycle. The central objective of
our proposed experiments is to fill these gaps in understanding through a systematic dissection of the structural
basis and functional roles of ExoN complex and its dynamic interlay with viral cofactors in viral RNA synthesis
and processing. We will use SARS-CoV-2 as a model system and employ a combination of cryo-electron
microscopy, single-molecule biophysics, protein-RNA biochemistry, and cell virology to achieve this central goal
through the following aspects: Project 1, coordination of polymerase and exoribonuclease during mismatch
correction. We will define the mechanism by which RNA mismatches are transferred from polymerase to ExoN
and identify the molecular determinants for their functional interplay. Project 2, modulation of ExoN complex by
viral cofactors. We will elucidate the molecular details of the interaction between ExoN complex and a key RTC
subunit, nsp8, and determine how this interaction modulates the proofreading activity of ExoN complex during
mismatch correction. Project 3, coupling of RNA exonucleolytic digestion and 5′ capping activities of ExoN
complex. Building on our newfound cryo-EM structure of a dimeric form of the ExoN complex in which its RNA
digestion and capping activities are coupled, we will determine the molecular and biochemical underpinnings
and establish the physiological significance of the functional link between the two enzymatic activities of ExoN
complex. Through this research program, we will reveal the principles and molecular details governing the
multifaceted roles of this unique viral RNA proofreader and provide new insights into the mechanisms and
regulation of coronavirus genome replication and transcription. More broadly, the established tools and
experimental platforms are readily applicable to studying other RNA viruses."

This resubmission application requests a third cycle of support for the Northwestern University Infectious
Diseases Education and Science (NuIDeas) Training Program. The goal of this program is to take advantage
of the clinical and basic research expertise and resources available at Northwestern University to train MD and
MD/PhD fellows in infectious disease translational research. This training program leverages the considerable
clinical expertise of the Infectious Disease faculty with the long-standing basic science strengths in
microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University, which together create a rich environment for
translational research. Each trainee works with both a primary research mentor and a clinical co-mentor to
enhance the translational aspects of the fellow's research experience. Excellence in research will be promoted
by a training program consisting of an intensive research experience, the option to obtain a Master of Science
degree in Clinical Investigation, seminars, career development programs, and education in the ethical conduct
of research. One highly qualified MD or MD/PhD fellow is chosen each year for a two-year intensive research
experience. Furthermore, the Feinberg School of Medicine has funded a second trainee slot, such that a total
of two new trainees have been and will continue to be enrolled into the program each year. To date, the
NuIDeas Program has been highly successful. Eleven fellows were appointed to the NIH-funded slots. Of the
nine who have finished training in NuIDeas, seven now hold academic infectious disease appointments, five of
which have protected research time. During the third cycle of funding, we propose several innovations,
including a multifaceted focus on diversity, the addition of a novel research training exercise to bridge bedside
to bench discoveries, an apprenticeship program to train the next generation of NuIDeas leaders, a post-
NuIDeas program to provide an additional year of research training, and an expansion of the panel of mentors
to better match research opportunities to the interests of the fellows. This program will position trainees to
assume leadership positions in research and education at a critical time during which COVID-19 and other
global infectious disease threats are coupled with a shrinking pool of infectious disease subspecialists."
10880603,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The transcription factor p53 is one of the most critical barriers to tumorigenesis. p53 is mutated in over half of
all human tumors, and p53-mutant tumors typically carry a worse prognosis. As a tumor suppressor, p53
appears to act at the transition from benign to malignant disease, preventing transformation of cells that have
already acquired some pro-tumor features, such as oncogene activation or DNA damage. Decades of research
have sought to identify what makes p53 a potent tumor suppressor, as such knowledge could inform effective
strategies for cancer prevention and treatment. This research has shown that p53 can be activated by a variety
of signals, and in turn activated p53 can regulate a wide variety of cellular processes, including cell survival,
senescence, genomic stability, and plasticity. However, the inducers and actions of p53 vary with context, and
there is still no consensus on what signals engage p53 during early neoplasia and what biological programs
are most important for its tumor-suppressive functions. Furthermore, we still do not know the key events
following p53 loss that enable transition to malignancy. Attempts to gain this knowledge have been hampered
by a lack of tools to directly study p53 in the specific cells undergoing transformation within endogenous
contexts. To address these gaps in knowledge, we will study the events surrounding p53 activation and loss
during the initiation of pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDAC), an aggressive cancer in which p53 loss—which
occurs in 70% of PDACs—enables progression from benign precursor lesions to full-blown cancer. We
recently developed new mouse models of PDAC that allow us to “see” p53 in action as cells progress through
the benign-to-malignant transition. Among the premalignant pancreas cells, we discovered a subpopulation
that shares many transcriptional features with established tumor cells, and thus these cells appear to be
transitioning from premalignant to malignant. These transitioning cells are also the cells with the strongest p53
activation, and so they provide a unique opportunity to study p53 engagement and tumor-suppressive function
at the benign-to-malignant transition. Using single-cell transcriptional and spatial analyses, new computational
approaches to infer cell state transitions, and our well-established platform for rapid genetic perturbations in
vivo, we will define the cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic events that lead to this p53-active transitioning cell state.
Furthermore, we will investigate the mechanisms by which activated p53 suppresses neoplastic transformation
in the transitioning cells, as well as the events that influence cancer initiation immediately following p53 loss.
This project will provide novel insight into the mechanisms that drive PDAC initiation and provide a direct and
detailed characterization of p53 in action in endogenous contexts. Given the high prevalence of TP53
mutations in human cancers, we expect the insights into tumorigenesis to be applicable to many cancer types."

Developmental language disorder (DLD) is a highly prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder with significant
impacts on many aspects of life functioning including literacy, educational attainment, and employment
opportunities. Unfortunately, most children with DLD are not identified and do not receive services to improve
their outcomes. The long-term goal of this project is to improve the identification of DLD and to contribute to
improved systems of support for language and literacy development for all children. We will characterize the
developmental trajectory of language comprehension in the primary grades using novel, group-administered
measures focusing on skills which (a) undergo significant development in the primary grades, (b) appear
frequently in academic settings, (c) are important for reading comprehension, and (d) are appropriate for use
with students from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds. The use of group-administered measures
promotes feasibility and allows for practical implementation in real-world classrooms. Items measuring syntax,
vocabulary, and derivation of novel word meanings will be developed and calibrated to create an across-grade
vertical scale of measurement for language performance. Developmental change in language comprehension
will be evaluated with three administrations of language comprehension measures per year in grades K and 1
(e.g., Fall, Winter, Spring) and one administration in grade 2. We will evaluate the clinical and educational
validity of the novel language comprehension measures by conducting an accelerated cohort design study
spanning grades K through 3 and relating them to standardized measures of language and reading abilities
that will be administered once in each grade. Clinical utility will be examined using (a) traditional binary
classification analyses of sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios, and (b) with cutting-edge continuous
measurement models. The latter models will estimate individual change along a continuum, allowing us to
evaluate student trends over time rather than simplistic pass-fail criteria, which may be arbitrary and
inconsistent. This information will help clinicians identify when children may appear to be achieving adequately
but at risk of approaching a clinical threshold, as well as when children receiving language supports are rising
back up toward a level of performance more typical of their peers or level of instruction."
10883703,"Bladder cancer (BC) is a common cancer of the urinary tract. While low-grade tumors have a good
prognosis, two-thirds of patients with high-grade BC have tumors invading the bladder wall muscle and beyond
(MIBC). Patients with MIBC are at high-risk for metastasis, significant morbidity, and mortality. Cystectomy
(bladder removal) is the primary treatment for MIBC. Many patients with MIBC receive treatment before surgery
(neoadjuvant) to downstage the tumor and to treat micrometastases. However, half of these patients develop
metastasis within two years. Although immunotherapy is approved for treatment, the response rate is ~ 25%,
leaving chemotherapy as the main treatment. Gemcitabine (Gem)-based combination treatments are used in the
neoadjuvant, and adjuvant/salvage settings for better tolerability. Sequential Gem-based bladder instillations are
increasingly being used to delay/prevent recurrence in patients with high-grade non-MIBC (NMIBC). However,
Gem combinations are empirical, not without toxicity and few consider Gem-resistance. The goal of this study is
to evaluate two evidence-based Gem combinations to improve outcome in patients with NMIBC and MIBC.
 Chase is the first of its kind in humans that cleaves chondroitin sulfate from proteoglycans. Chase was
discovered to drive bladder tumorigenesis, tumor growth, metastasis, and Gem resistance. Chase and its
molecular signaling pathway that induces Gem resistance are expressed in bladder tumor specimens. We found
two well-characterized compounds with potential to overcome Chase-induced Gem resistance. While one
compound inhibited the Chase activity, another inhibited its downstream signaling pathway. Combination of Gem
with either compound re-sensitized Gem-resistant pre-clinical BC models to Gem. The project is designed to test
the hypothesis that inhibition of Chase or its signaling abolishes Gem resistance. Furthermore, the development
of Gem combinations with one or both compounds, together with the evaluation of Chase and Chase-signaling
for predicting response to Gem-based treatments, will enable the clinical translation of these combinations for
the treatment of advanced BC. In BC models, we will investigate the molecular mechanism of ablating Chase-
induced Gem resistance by either of the two compounds (inhibitor of Chase or of Chase-signaling) (Aim 1). We
will evaluate Chase-related molecules to predict treatment response, optimize the dose of the combinations and
validate their favorable tolerability and target specificity (Aim 2). We will use advanced BC and patient-derived
xenograft models to compare the efficacy of Gem combination with each compound and with the current Gem-
based treatments (Aim 3).
Impact: Few studies have evaluated Gem resistance, and how to overcome it. Evaluation of evidenced-based
novel combinations that target Chase-induced Gem resistance, and of Chase-related molecules as predictors of
response to Gem-based treatments, should reveal which combination is superior and who could receive it."

Benjamin Lee, MD – Principal Investigator (PI)
Childhood undernutrition affects approximately 200 million children around the world and is associated with
increased risk of child mortality from infectious diseases. It is generally accepted that undernutrition, as
manifested by growth impairment, causes functional immune deficiency that increases susceptibility to severe
infections. However, other than in the most extreme form of severe acute malnutrition (SAM), an immunologic
basis for this increased risk in undernourished children has yet to be convincingly demonstrated. This may be
due in part to previous methodologic limitations, such as reliance on cross-sectional evaluations that cofounded
identification of children at highest risk and use of rudimentary methods of immune assessment. This project will
address this knowledge gap via longitudinal evaluation of underexplored aspects of pediatric immune
development in undernourished and healthy children from a birth cohort study conducted in Dhaka, Bangladesh
(PROVIDE). In Aim 1, the multidisciplinary research team will first use stool metagenomic sequencing to
investigate the critical contribution of gut microbiota maturation to growth phenotype during the first 2 years of
life, and persistence of these effects into later childhood. Children with SAM from this community have previously
demonstrated impaired microbiota maturation. This study will assess whether similar perturbations, along with
measures of diversity, taxonomic community structure, and metabolic pathways may affect children with other
forms of growth impairment, including growth failure, stunting, and underweight. In Aim 2, the project will evaluate
measures of T cell diversity and systemic inflammation in these children, along with exploratory analyses using
single-cell proteogenomics to identify immune cell profiles unique to each growth phenotype. Finally, the impact
of the gut microbiota on these immune outcomes will be investigated. This project will use careful case selection
in a well-characterized longitudinal cohort to address critical knowledge gaps relating to undernutrition,
microbiota development, and development and maintenance of immune diversity. The knowledge gained herein
will provide a major contribution to basic understanding of fundamentally important aspects of the “first 1000
days of life,” the window period from conception to age 2 most critical for establishment of healthy growth and
development in children. Ultimately, this work may help inform needed interventions to improve children and
development, particularly in resource-limited settings where undernutrition and child mortality due to infections
is most prevalent."

The neovascular ‘wet’ form of age-related macular degeneration (nvAMD), whereby new blood vessels grow
under the retina, requires treatment with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor eye injections typically every 1-
3 months for the remainder of patients’ lives due to persistent fluid, which can be visualized and quantified by
optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging. Recent research has implicated matrix metalloproteinase 9
(MMP9), expressed in immune cells of the retinal blood supply (termed choroid), as a mediator in the formation
and persistence of nvAMD. This proposal will elucidate our understanding of this novel immune-based
mechanism. Characteristics of patients with high-risk genotype of MMP9 will also be assessed, as they are
associated with incomplete response to standard therapies for nvAMD. We will identify genetic regulatory
regions that control expression of MMP9 and determine the immunologic activation profiles in patients with
nvAMD. We will use artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches to associate phenotypic features observable
on OCT and OCT-angiography with high- and low-risk MMP9 genotypes in patients with nvAMD.
Our outstanding team of interdisciplinary researchers will collaborate to employ state-of-the-art genomic and
immunologic techniques to study the mechanisms of how MMP9 is implicated in nvAMD and fibrosis. Genetics
will aid AI- and machine learning-based analysis of OCT images to learn new features associated with the
most challenging patients afflicted with nvAMD. Unraveling the disease mechanisms associated with MMP9
will reveal new targets for therapeutic intervention. This proposal encompasses 5 of the 7 cross-cutting areas
of emphasis the NEI laid out in the 5-year Strategic Plan on November 1, 2021. This is the next, necessary
milestone in nvAMD that will help to address this major socioeconomic health burden."

Mitochondrial dysfunction and synaptic damage are early pathological features of the AD-affected
brain. The underlying mechanisms and strategies to rescue such injury remain elusive. There is
limited mechanistic study investigating the likely interplays between mitochondrial dysfunction
and neuroinflammation and their contribution to synaptic damage and tauopathy in AD and related
disorder (ADRD). Age-related accumulation of toxic metabolites such as advanced glycation end
products (AGEs) and methylglyoxal (MG) perturbs mitochondrial and synaptic dysfunction. Thus,
clearance of these toxic metabolites are important for maintaining mitochondrial integrity.
Glyoxalase 1 (GLO1) is a key enzyme for scavenging/detoxifying toxic metabolite MG to reduce
AGEs formation. So far,
the role of GLO1 on tau-mediated mitochondrial stress, tau pathology,
neurotoxic oligomer tau metabolism, neuroinflammation, synaptic and cognitive dysfunction in AD
and ADRD remains unexplored.
It is unclear whether circulating AGEs metabolites correlate to
synaptic mitochondrial function and glycation, whether neuronal GLO1 is a mechanistic linker
between mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation and synaptic injury and if gaining of
neuronal GLO1 could alleviate tau pathology and synaptic and cognitive dysfunction and slow
down disease progression in AD. We hypothesize that sustained accumulation of toxic
metabolites (MG/AGEs) serves as causative endogenous danger signals to initiate and accelerate
mitochondrial perturbation and tau pathology, leading to neuroinflammation and synaptic failure.
Clearance of AGEs metabolites by GLO1 may be important for reducing the pathophysiological
modifications associated with age-related carbonyl stress and mitochondrial pathology. This
proposal will address the fundamental unexplored questions of whether GLO1 is a key player in
tau-induced synaptic injury, tau pathology, and neuroinflammation, whether augmentation of
GLO1 proves beneficial for clearance of tau and toxic metabolites, mitochondrial quality, and
cognitive function as a therapeutic strategy in AD and ADRD, whether circulating serum and
platelet AGEs-related metabolites associate with cerebral mitochondrial dysfunction, and whether
these toxic metabolites can serve as risk factors/biomarkers for the onset and/or progression of
early AD and age-related cognitive dysfunction."

the neuronal output if they are activated together in clusters, triggering dendritic spikes.
 We want to re-examine the role of dendrites in neuronal function in vivo and help usher
in, a new “dendrocentric” paradigm of how neurons work, as opposed to the current
“somacentric” one. To bring this change, we will assemble a “Dendrite Consortium” of
complementary laboratories, expert in genetically-encoded voltage indicators, volumetric
two-photon imaging, holographic optogenetics and optochemistry, dendritic patching,
EM connectomics, superresolution synaptic mapping and computational models. Wwe
will use holographic optogenetics to activate dendritic spines in arbitrary patters (as if
one were “playing the piano”), while imaging voltage in 3D with new GEVIs in dendrites
from a subtype of L2/3 pyramidal neuron from mouse visual cortex in vivo during
sensory stimulation and spontaneous activity, combining this with direct patch recordings
from dendrites. These experiments will characterize the functional regimes that generate
dendritic spikes in vivo and elucidate their biophysical mechanisms and overall impact
on somatic spiking. We will then use connectomics and expansion microscopy to
reconstruct complete morphologies and synapse compositions of these dendrites,
including imaged ones. These combined functional and structural data will be used to
build a rigorous computational model of the neurons, where the functional and
computational roles of dendritic spikes will be explored numerically and systematically.
 Through a collective, integrated effort, we will elucidate the computational logic and
functional roles of dendrites and help usher in a new working model of a neuron. We will
also generate for the field open-access morphological, functional and computational
datasets of complete dendritic trees from one pyramidal neuron subtype, activated by
sensory stimulation or intracortical activity. These datasets, including “Rosetta” ones of
the same exact neuron, could enable answers to outstanding basic questions on
dendritic function in normal and pathological states, as dendrites are central functional
elements in all brain circuits and are affected in many neurological and mental disorders."

Decisions to admit patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) and sepsis (the most common and lethal cause
of the acute respiratory distress syndrome) to intensive care units (ICUs) are highly variable across the US.
And, yet, these triage decisions have a substantial impact on patient outcomes. In our prior work, we used
detailed electronic health record (EHR) data from 9.2 million hospitalizations and found that decisions to admit
ARF patients to wards were associated with a 3.8% absolute increase in mortality. In contrast, choices to admit
sepsis patients to ICUs resulted in considerably longer length of stay and a 5.1% absolute increase in death.
The nationwide impact of such discretionary triage would be exponentially greater. Our findings highlight
tremendous opportunities to improve ARF and sepsis outcomes by identifying the patient subgroups and
processes of care that most strongly contribute to the benefits and harms of ICU- versus ward-based care.
This application proposes to update our ARF and sepsis cohort such that it includes all admissions from 2013
through 2022 across 29 hospitals in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California and University of Pennsylvania
health systems, and incorporate more than 100 more data fields per patient. This curation of highly granular
EHR data will enable us to identify the: (1) distinct patient subgroups and phenotypes among those meeting
the syndromic criteria of `ARF' and `sepsis;' and the (2) processes of care and (3) inpatient complications that
causally explain the observed associations of ICU vs. ward triage with patient outcomes. Our multidisciplinary
team will apply diverse expertise in instrumental variable regression, mediation analyses, machine learning,
complex EHR data, and probabilistic phenotyping to complete three aims that promote our long-term goal of
improving care, and hence outcomes, for patients with ARF and sepsis regardless of where they are treated.
Several methodological innovations will enable us to achieve these goals, and, in turn, to not only surmount
key limitations of prior studies that sought to determine which acutely ill patients benefit from ICU admission,
but identify the mechanisms underlying such triage effects. These data will also allow us to quantify the impact
of COVID-19 on ICU and ward triage patterns, care processes, and outcomes among ARF and sepsis patients,
thereby modernizing our results and enabling their applicability to pandemic eras.
Completing the aims of this study will improve public health by identifying ways in which emergency
departments, ICUs, and wards can improve outcomes for the more than 4 million Americans hospitalized each
year with ARF and/or sepsis. Such results will enable development and testing of personalized triage
algorithms, and guide optimal care for patients without always requiring ICU admission, thereby improving
patient outcomes, reducing health care costs, and preserving ICU capacity for patients who truly need it."
10890186,"Project Summary/Abstract:
The focus of this proposal is based on our ongoing efforts to link genetic sequence variation leading to changes
in the protein fold triggering human genetic disease using an unprecedented variation spatial profiling (VSP)
approach we have pioneered. VSP is a Gaussian process (GP) regression machine learning approach that
utilizes human variation to assign function for each residue in the protein fold responsible for the genotype to
phenotype transformation driving human biology- a new technology that is universal in application to any protein.
VSP is built on the general principle of spatial covariance (SCV) which describes fundamental covariant
relationships between all residues dictating the protein fold and function. These spatial relationships allow us to
define with assigned uncertainty the role of each residue in genetic disease to define the residue-residue
interactions that drive function in protein structure using variation capture (VarC). We focus on the cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), the causative agent of CF, as a model protein to understand
SCV/VarC relationships dictating the impact of genetic variation on folding and trafficking through the exocytic
pathway. To understand how genetic variation impacting protein fold design is managed by proteostasis folding
and COPII based trafficking pathways, and how we can improve function in genetic disease by promoting protein
fold fitness through small molecule correctors, we propose 3 goals. In Aim 1, we will utilize SCV relationships to
dissect the contribution of the Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperone/co-chaperone proteostasis systems we hypothesize
are misaligned for the proper management of naturally occurring genetic variants triggering disease- and that
these components can be retuned by adjusting their activity through molecular and chemical approaches. In Aim
2, we hypothesize that the proteostasis system generates SCV-defined 'set-points'. SCV set-points are
composed of select clusters of SCV defined residue-residue spatial relationships in the protein structure that
serve as master regulators for presentation of CFTR to the COPII ER export machinery through a cytosolic
exposed 'YKDAD' exit code. We hypothesize that COPII components differentially respond to SCV set-points
impacted by genetic variation to generate disease in the individual. We will determine the impact of genetic
variation for each of the steps dictating COPII assembly to understand those events responsible for
pathophysiology. In Aim 3, we further hypothesize based on GP logistics that variant CFTR polypeptides will be
highly responsive to novel correctors that directly interact with the fold to restore function. We will utilize an SCV-
based 'triangulation' approach to identify small molecules that directly impact the stability of the YKDAD exit motif
defective in F508del and other variants to identify compounds that affect a cure for CF using in silico
computational screening and experimental validation. The combined efforts outlined in Aims 1-3 will allow us to
define a genome based mechanistic foundation for how the fold can be reprogrammed for optimal fitness in the
individual by reducing the impact of variation triggering human genetic disease."

Application of multiscale computer modeling to help guide and elucidate heart disease treatments is emerging.
Computational modeling, however, has not been exploited for optimizing cardiac resynchronization therapy
(CRT). While CRT has emerged as a powerful treatment for heart failure (HF) to restore normal activation pattern
in the heart, about 30% of patients still do not improve after therapy (non-responders). Improvement of responder
rate therefore remains a crucial clinical challenge and the holy grail of CRT. We believe that computational
modeling can help optimize CRT and improve the responder rate. Equally important, the development of a
multiscale computational framework that considers the key physics of the heart can help understand several
novel pacing therapies (e.g., conduction system pacing (CSP) including HIS bundle pacing and left branch
bundle (LBB) pacing) that have been developed recently to improve the responder rate. Specifically,
computational modeling can help elucidate the key factors affecting the long and short-term effectiveness of
these pacing therapies in patients with different intraventricular conduction delay and/or LV scar/ischemia. Here,
the overall goal here is to develop computational approaches that combine machine learning algorithms and
physics-based modeling to fundamentally understand the short and long-term effects of CRT that includes CSP,
optimize CRT, and to elucidate the advantages and disadvantages of CSP over standard CRT. The following
specific aims are constructed to accomplish this goal. First, we will develop an experimentally-validated
multiscale cardiac electro-mechanics-perfusion (EMP) computational framework to simulate the chronic effects
of CRT and CSP in treating mechanical dyssynchrony in LBBB + ischemia. Second, we will integrate the
computational modeling framework with efficient machine learning and optimization algorithms to optimize CRT
with LV epicardial and endocardial pacing in ischemia. Third, we will use the validated multiscale computational
EMP framework to elucidate the effects and factors affecting the response of CSP in ischemia. The proposed
approach and methodologies are innovative. More importantly, successful completion will directly translate the
findings to the clinic for optimization of CRT therapy to reduce non-responder rates as well as patient
identification for different pacing therapies. This would have substantial impact on improving the treatment and
reducing the cost of HF epidemic."

Synaptic development is a highly conserved process that underlies the functional connectivity of the nervous
system. Deficits in synaptic development are associated with multiple neurological disorders, like autism
spectrum disorders, intellectual disabilities, epilepsy, and schizophrenia. Therefore, restoration of healthy
synapse development in cases of neurodevelopmental disorders represents one goal for developing better
treatments. However, the lack of molecular targets to achieve this goal presents a significant barrier to the
development of new therapies. Identifying the signaling pathways that promote or restore synapse development
will reveal new mechanisms for modulating neuronal circuit development and function. The overall goal for the
proposed research is to uncover how a series of small GTPases coordinate synapse development at the
Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular junction. The central hypothesis is that PXF-1, a Rap guanine nucleotide
exchange factor, promotes synapse development through the sequential activation of Rap, Ras, and Rac
GTPases to sustain perisynaptic actin filaments during neuromuscular development. To identify the molecular
mechanisms that govern the putative GTPase signaling cascade, we will use genetics and cell biology to identify
the guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase activating proteins that modulate each GTPase in the
pathway. We will use fluorescent biosensors and genetic engineering to elucidate the molecular mechanisms
through which Rap, Ras, and Rac signaling pathways interact with one another. The proposed research is
innovative because it uses the powerful model system of Caenorhabditis elegans to study how GTPase networks
function as molecular switches to control synapse development and motor circuit function. The development and
use of new molecular tools to observe and modulate signal transduction in vivo will provide additional innovations
for cellular and molecular neuroscience. The studies proposed in this application are significant because they
will reveal how small G protein signaling networks promote synapse development and how modulation of these
GTPase signaling modules can mitigate neuronal circuit dysfunctions."

Sleep has been identified as a state of heightened neural plasticity, but the rules that govern reorganization
during sleep remain unknown. To better identify the conditions under which synapses are pruned during sleep,
we have begun to examine responses to neural injury in the fruit fly. After antennal transection, flies acutely
increase their sleep for up to one day before returning back to baseline levels. Our preliminary data also show
that pre-synaptic active zones are removed more rapidly than plasma membrane after antennal injury, and that
sleep deprivation after injury prevents the clearance of pre-synapses from injured olfactory receptor neurons.
In this project, we will examine: (1) signals that are generated after injuries to promote sleep; (2) contributions
of glial cell types to sleep regulation and synapse removal after injury; and (3) molecular mechanisms that
promote synapse removal during sleep. We anticipate that these experiments will provide insight into the role
for sleep in response to neural trauma, and begin to investigate the consequences of disrupted sleep on
recovery from axotomy."

The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by cytopenias
and dysplasia in one or more of the myeloid cell lines due to ineffective hematopoiesis. Patients present with
signs and symptoms of anemia, accompanied by infections and bleeding leading to serious morbidity. Loss of
chromosome 7 (-7) or the long-arm of 7 [del(7q)] is commonly seen in high-risk MDS patients. Treatment
options are limited and high-risk patients have less than one-year survival. Cut-like homeobox 1 (CUX1), a
transcription factor encoded in the commonly deleted segment of 7q22, is expressed at haploinsufficient
transcript and protein levels in -7/del(7q) myeloid diseases. Knockdown of CUX1 causes a spontaneous
hematopoietic disorder with many features of human MDS, including erythroid dysplasia, and fatal anemia,
indicating that loss of this single gene is sufficient to cause disease. Remarkably, CUX1 re-expression reverses
MDS in mice, which provides the premise for the current proposal, that restoration of CUX1 is a viable
therapeutic strategy for MDS patients. However, there exists a major gap in our understanding of the
mechanisms by which CUX1 levels are regulated. Preliminary studies indicate that Glycogen synthase kinase-
3 (GSK3) inhibition increases cellular CUX1 protein levels. The central hypothesis is that pharmacological
induction of CUX1 levels will restore hematopoietic stem cell homeostasis and reverse impaired differentiation
in CUX1 deficient myeloid disease models. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims:
1) define the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which CUX1 levels are regulated, and 2) drive normal
erythroid differentiation of -7/del(7q) myelodysplasia through therapeutic restoration of CUX1. Under the first
aim, GSK3 mediated post-translational regulatory mechanism of CUX1 levels will be determined using site-
directed mutational analysis in immortalized human blood cell lines. Additionally, a genome-wide
CRISPR/Cas9 loss of function screen will be utilized to identify novel regulators of CUX1. For the second aim,
CD34+ human -7/del(7q) MDS cells and CUX1-deficient mouse models will be used to determine the efficacy
of GSK3 isoform selective inhibitors in restoring CUX1 protein and reversing erythroid differentiation defects.
The proposed research is expected to reveal druggable and regulatory pathways of CUX1 to restore its levels
as a way of reversing anemia and dysplasia in -7/del(7q) MDS patients."

for EDs are suboptimal, with only 50% of adults responding to evidence based treatments and
no evidence-based treatment for anorexia nervosa (AN) or Other Specified Feeding or Eating

Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV), the most recently discovered tumor virus, can cause a highly
aggressive form of skin cancer called Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). While the incidence of MCC has
tripled over the past twenty years, there is no effective therapy for metastatic MCCs, highlighting the
need to better understand MCPyV oncogenic mechanism in order to develop more successful
therapies. MCPyV asymptomatically infects most of the human population, but tends to cause MCC in
the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. These observations suggest that host immunity
plays a critical role in controlling MCPyV-induced tumorigenesis. However, very little is known about
the innate immune response elicited by MCPyV. Neither is it clear how a dysregulated immune
system contributes to MCC tumorigenesis. This is largely because MCPyV tropism was previously
unknown and there was a lack of biologically relevant culture system for MCPyV. Recently, we
discovered that human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) support productive MCPyV infection and
established the first in vitro as well as ex vivo infection models for MCPyV. Using these systems, we
demonstrated that MCPyV infection activates STING-mediated innate immune responses, which in
turn restrict viral amplification and spread. In addition, we discovered that STING is silenced in
MCPyV(+) MCC tumors, revealing that loss of STING function is needed to drive MCC tumorigenesis.
Our studies suggest that disruption of STING function may cause pathologic rampant replication of
MCPyV to promote viral genome integration into the host genome, which is a key event in MCPyV-
driven tumorigenesis. In addition, loss of STING function may allow MCPyV-induced pre-cancerous
cells to circumvent its tumor suppressive effects, thus stimulating cell proliferation and tumorigenesis.
Building on these observations, we hypothesize that STING functions not only as a key antiviral
immune mediator for controlling MCPyV infection but also a prime tumor suppressor that blocks
MCPyV-driven tumorigenesis. To test this hypothesis, we will combine the in vitro and ex vivo MCPyV
infection models with 3D “artificial human skin” reconstructed in mice to examine the impact of STING
innate immune sensing pathways on MCPyV infection (Aim 1) and to determine how disruption of
STING signaling impacts MCPyV-driven MCC tumorigenesis (Aim 2). Through revealing the largely
unknown interplay between MCPyV and the innate immune system, our ultimate goal is to understand
how poorly controlled MCPyV infection leads to MCC development. Identification of immune effectors
that normally restrict MCPyV propagation could also unveil novel strategies for preventing and treating
the devastating MCC cancers."

Episodic memory describes our ability to weave temporally contiguous elements into recollections of
rich and coherent experiences. Episodic memory formation is specifically degraded by degenerative
conditions such as Alzheimer’s Disease. The activity of ‘time cells’ in the mesial temporal lobe may
provide a mechanism for the coding of temporal information that is necessary for the formation of these
memories, and we recently published evidence of time cells in the human hippocampus using
microelectrode recordings from epilepsy patients. The spike rate of these cells reliably increases at
specific moments within a fixed interval, and groups (assemblies) of time cells can represent a ‘temporal
space’ analogous to the manner in which hippocampal place cells are held to represent physical space,
imposing temporal organization on event representations. In this proposal, we build on preliminary
data to investigate the flexible participation of time cells in neuronal assemblies using established
methods. We will test how time cells support serial memory by adjudicating between two models, one
based on time cell activity (`time cell model’) versus a different proposed mechanism by which serial
recall depends on the consistent phase offset of the spiking of hippocampal neurons relative to theta
oscillations (‘phase offset model’). This experiment will test key unresolved questions about how time
cells contribute to episodic memory. Finally, we will test the impact of cholinergic blockade on time
cells and cell assemblies. This novel experiment builds on the preliminary data we present in our
proposal showing the effects of scopolamine administration in 10 intracranial EEG subjects, which
identify alterations in hippocampal theta and gamma oscillations in the setting of cholinergic blockade.
Our experiments include a number of key innovations, including examining time cell activity during serial
recall, assembly formation, and especially in the setting of modulation of cholinergic innervation. The
data we propose to collect will fill key gaps in understanding related to time cell activity in humans and
potentially establish cholinergic modulation in human intracranial EEG subjects as a method to elucidate
physiological patterns during mnemonic processing and to model the effects of disorders such as
Alzheimer’s Disease in this population."

Due to considerable advances in resuscitation, the number of cardiac arrest (CA) patients who survive the initial
arrest and are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) has been steadily increasing. However, among this growing
patient population, the morbidity and mortality rates remain unacceptably high. This has been attributed primarily to
post-CA syndrome of which an imbalanced immune response is a key component. Using our clinically relevant
murine model of CA and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CA/CPR), we recently discovered that following
CA/CPR, there is a clear shift from the well-established acute post-CA pro-inflammatory immune response to
the less-known anti-inflammatory immune response, which eventually evolves into a severe immunosuppressive
state. Further, our preliminary data clearly support a link between this immunosuppressive state, and post-CA
infection and poor functional recovery. Importantly, this notion is corroborated by clinical observations that
infectious complications occur in a high percentage of CA survivors, and post-resuscitation infection is believed
to increase morbidity and mortality. Therefore, it is of tremendous clinical significance to better understand post-
CA immunosuppression. Our long-term goal is to develop novel therapeutic strategies to improve CA prognosis.
The objective here is to dissect mechanisms that underpin post-CA immunosuppression, and to determine the
effects of targeting post-CA immunosuppression on CA outcome, including incidence of infections and long-term
functional recovery. Notably, our pilot studies have provided compelling evidence indicating that activation of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a primary mechanism that drives post-CA immunosuppression. Our
central hypothesis is that CA and resuscitation activates inflammasomes in the brain, which in turn activates the
HPA axis, leading to immunosuppression and poor CA outcome. This hypothesis is based on our strong
preliminary data and on substantial literature related to disease-induced immunosuppression. We will test our
central hypothesis by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) Determine the role of the HPA axis in post-CA
immunosuppression; 2) Determine the role of inflammasomes in post-CA immunosuppression via the HPA axis;
and 3) Determine the effects of modulating post-CA immunosuppression on CA outcomes. The proposed
research is significant because knowledge we will gain from this study is expected to inform future development
of new post-resuscitation care strategies to mitigate detrimental effects of post-CA immune dysfunction and thus,
improve overall CA prognosis."

lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) and reduce associated pain, paresthesias, and/or weakness when walking (i.e.,
intermittent neurogenic claudication - INC). Our recent prospective cohort study of 193 older veterans followed
for 12 months following DL revealed that over 50% of participants did not experience significant functional
improvement. Similar rates of failed surgery have been reported in non-veteran populations. Since the vast
majority of DLs are performed electively, non-surgical treatment is recommended as an initial step. Two clinical
trials have demonstrated modest efficacy of manual therapy and exercise (MTE) for people with INC that was
sustained in one trial, but not in the other. Recent clinical practice guidelines recommend adding acupuncture
as a non-surgical pain management strategy and highlight the need for high quality evidence to support this
recommendation. Our clinical experience and preliminary research data regarding the efficacy of
electroacupuncture (specifically, intramuscular electroacupuncture [IMEA]) in these patients are promising.
Ultimately, we wish to conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial to optimize and sustain the efficacy of MTE
by potentially a) increasing the robustness of the initial response via addition of IMEA and b) its durability via
boosters. This two-site feasibility study will be conducted at Boston Medical Center and the Orlando VA
Medical Center, chosen because of their sociodemographic diversity and prevalence of patients with multiple
comorbidities, characteristics that will ultimately facilitate broad generalizability of study findings. We will
evaluate the feasibility of recruiting, randomizing and retaining participants; fidelity of intervention delivery;
participant adherence to prescribed interventions; and the accuracy and completeness of data collection
procedures. Fifty-six participants (28 per site) with imaging-identified LSS and INC who have not had lumbar
surgery, will be randomized to receive 1) MTE for 3 months (10 sessions over 12 weeks) followed by a 6-
months observation period; 2) MTE for 3 months followed by monthly MTE booster sessions for 6-months; OR
3) MTE + IMEA for 3 months followed by monthly MTE + IMEA for 6-months. The primary outcome (Brigham
Spinal Stenosis questionnaire) will be measured at baseline, 3 months (primary endpoint), 6 and 9 months. We
also will measure community mobility (life space), emotional functioning (PHQ8 and GAD7), pain medications,
and other key parameters relevant to older adults with LSS and INC (e.g., smoking, BMI, medical comorbidity).
Fidelity will be optimized by delivering standardized provider training, conducting regular review of participant-
provider intervention sessions and documentation, and monthly all-site huddles. We also will monitor
participant attendance and home exercise compliance. If we demonstrate feasibility of our proposed methods,
we will be positioned to test a new model of care for patients with LSS and INC designed to optimize their

 To better understand genetic basis of complex human traits, two fundamentally different and complementary
designs employed in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are population-based and family-based designs.
With the advent of biobanks and large-scale biomedical databases, recent years have seen an explosion in
genetic studies of adult traits/diseases, and consequently, a rapid advancement in methodology for population-
based designs that these biobanks depend on. In contrast, methods for family-based designs have received little
to no attention although they play an important role in the investigation of genetic basis of low-prevalence/rare
disorders and of child health outcomes. Analysis methods based on family-based designs can protect against
population stratification and admixture (thus allowing for racial/ethnic diversity among participants), and can be
more powerful than a population-based study of similar sample size. Another consequence of large-scale
biobanks is the public availability of aggregate-level genotype-trait association results (or GWAS summary
statistics) for a wide spectrum of complex human traits, including molecular traits that are intermediate between
genotype and a disease-related trait. Methods that can leverage GWAS summary statistics to understand biology
underlying diseases are in high demand since they are nearly as efficient and avoid logistical/ethical concerns
related to sharing individual-level data. In this application, I propose a research program of developing
novel statistical methods and open-access tools for genetic epidemiology studies, with a particular
focus on family-based designs. Some of these methods/tools will leverage only association summary
statistics to innovatively integrate omics with disease data, thereby helping improve understanding of
regulatory mechanisms underlying human health. We seek to address some of the open problems of human
trait genetics, including methodological challenges in identifying non-additive genetic effects (e.g. gene-gene
interaction, gene-environment interaction, parent-of-origin effect), effects of rare variants, and in prioritizing
causal variants through integrative omics. We will bring obscure mathematical functions from statistical literature
to real public health applications while illustrating them on existing databases. This research program will
support diversity in three distinct ways: methodological advancement of family-based designs that overcome
challenges related to racial/ethnic diversity in participants; efficient methods/tools that allow genomic researchers
to conduct genetic epidemiology studies using publicly available summary data even in resource-poor
environments; and help train diverse graduate students recruited annually by the Johns Hopkins School of Public
Health. In the last 5 years, I have built a research profile in family-based genetic studies alongside population-
based ones, have developed cutting-edge methods based on summary-level data, have enabled data-driven
policy-making via reproducible data science methods/tools, and have acquired mentoring skills. My multi-
disciplinary training and my prior experience puts me in a unique position to successfully complete this program."

Anastasis is a newly discovered cell recovery mechanism that rescues apoptotic cells from the brink of death.
Challenging the classic view of irreversible apoptosis, we have discovered robust reversibility of apoptosis in
three types of mouse/rat primary cells, twelve human cancer cell lines, and egg chambers in fruit flies. What are
the physiological functions, pathological roles, and therapeutic potentials of anastasis? Anastasis could
be an unexpected cytoprotective mechanism for preserving terminally differentiated cells and tissues that are
difficult to replace, such as cardiomyocytes and neurons. If true, enhancing anastasis may be beneficial for
treating heart failure and brain injury. Besides, anastasis could be an unrecognized escape tactic enabling cancer
cells to survive cancer therapy, thereby contributing to disease recurrence. If confirmed, suppressing anastasis
in dying cancer cells may promote cancer cell death and reduce the chances of recurrence. Anastasis may also
play important roles in limiting apoptosis during embryonic development and normal homeostasis. If identified,
understanding its regulation can provide new insights into the control of cell death and survival in physiological
conditions. However, there are several challenges of testing these hypotheses. It is difficult to track anastasis,
especially in vivo, because cells that have reversed apoptosis are morphologically indistinguishable from healthy
cells. There are no anastasis-specific hallmarks identified, and the regulators of anastasis remain undiscovered.
Here, we will overcome many of these challenges by developing a novel and highly specific tracking system to
label anastatic cells for mammalian studies, and to identify the key regulators of anastasis. To mark anastatic
cells, we will create an anastasis biosensor that can tag anastatic cells with permanent expression of a
fluorescent protein only after they have recovered from both mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization
(MOMP) and caspase-3 activation, the two most recognized apoptotic events, making this biosensor system
highly specific to anastasis. We will establish anastasis biosensor stable cell lines to determine reversibility of
apoptosis in vitro, and will employ biosensor xenografts to interrogate anastasis in vivo using clinically relevant
mouse models. To elucidate the mechanism of anastasis, we will identify its key regulators, through proteomics,
genetics, and pharmacological approaches. We will identify which genes exhibit up- or down-expression
(potential anastasis regulators, and therapeutic targets) during different stages of anastasis, determine whether
specific post-translational modifications distinguish anastatic cells, establish whether cells that recover from
different cell death inductions share similar molecular features, and investigate how interfering with anastasis
regulator candidates could modulate the reversibility of apoptosis. We will identify small molecules that target
the candidates by bioinformatics, and test their efficacy in promoting or suppressing anastasis in vitro.
Successful completion of this project will generate essential tools and knowledge for studying anastasis, thereby
laying a strong foundation for developing revolutionary new therapeutic approaches by controlling anastasis."
10914976,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Obesity and the associated insulin resistance are the established risk factors for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Although
more than 90% of T2D patients are overweight or obese, only about 30% of obese people develop T2D. One
major determining factor for the development of T2D in obese patients is islet β−cell decomposition or failure,
resulting in relative insulin deficiency. It is well documented that islet failure has a strong genetic predisposition.
Genome-wide association study (GWAS) provides a powerful tool to associate genetic variants (SNPs) with T2D.
However, the vast majority of the diabetes risk SNPs from GWAS are found in the non-coding regions, posing
significant challenges to identifying the SNP-associated genes for T2D. 3’untranslated regions (3’UTR) are non-
coding sequences containing cis-regulatory elements (CRE), such as binding sites for miRNAs and RNA-binding
proteins (RBPs) that regulate mRNA fate and protein expression. Alternative polyadenylation (APA) at the 3’UTR
is an RNA-processing mechanism that generates mRNA isoforms with significantly different 3’UTR lengths with
distinct CREs. SNPs that regulate APA may lengthen or shorten 3’UTR, thereby altering gene expression and
function. We recently developed a novel 3’UTR APA quantitative trait loci (3’aQTLs) analysis tool to colocalize
disease-associated SNPs with APA. Using the 3’aQTLs tool, we found that the lengthening of 3’UTR of zinc
finger CCCH domain-containing protein 13 (ZC3H13) in the pancreas was highly associated with T2D. ZC3H13
is a key epitranscriptomic factor that forms an N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification writer complex with
methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) and methyltransferase-like 14 (METTL14). Both METTL3 and METTL14-
mediated m6A have been shown to be essential for β-cell function. Our preliminary data show that longer
ZC3H13 3’UTR reduced ZC3H13 protein expression without changes to mRNA levels. Knocking down ZC3H13
suppressed insulin production in the cultured β-cells. Furthermore, ZC3H13 heterozygous knockout mice
exhibited impaired glucose tolerance with reduced insulin levels when challenged with a high-fat diet. We,
therefore, hypothesize that the reduced ZC3H13 protein expression from 3’aQTLs-associated 3’UTR
lengthening contributes to the genetic predisposition of islet failure in T2D. We propose three aims to study what
SNPs cause ZC3H13 3’UTR lengthening, why ZC3H13 3’UTR lengthening reduces protein expression, and
how the reduced ZC3H13 protein impairs islet function. Aim 1: To identify the causal SNPs impacting APA of
ZC3H13 using functionally informed fine-mapping of 3'aQTLs. Aim 2: To determine the mechanisms by which
3’UTR lengthening reduces ZC3H13 protein expression. Aim 3: To investigate the mechanisms by which
reduced ZC3H13 expression impairs insulin production and islet function. Our studies will advance the field by
uncovering ZC3H13 APA as a novel genetic risk factor and elucidating ZC3H13-mediated epitranscriptomic
regulation as a novel mechanism for the impaired β-cell function in T2D."
10846711,"Chronic pain conditions plague more than 20% of adults in the United States, emphasizing the need for
a more comprehensive understanding of pain control mechanisms and identification of better pain therapies.
This need is amplified further by the current opioid crisis, which killed over 60,000 Americans in 2020. While
opioids are remarkably effective treatments for acute and chronic pain, adverse side effects, including abuse
liability and tolerance to the analgesic effects with repeated use, highlight the need for non-opioid pain
therapies. This need motivates our investigations of pain modulation by acetylcholine (ACh) and its receptors.
 Ascending nociceptive signaling from periphery to central nervous system is modulated by the
descending pain modulatory pathway, including the ventrolateral periaqueductal grey (vlPAG) and its
projections to rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM). This pathway is a crucial site of action of opioids and
endogenous pain control. While much is known about this circuitry, the impact of neuromodulators like ACh on
this circuit, particularly under chronic pain conditions have not been investigated. Using a fluorescent ACh
sensor, we will investigate how pain and other behaviorally relevant stimuli alter ACh release dynamics in the
vlPAG. Using brain slice electrophysiology, we will identify the cellular mechanisms behind alterations in ACh
release. And finally, we will attempt to reverse these maladaptive ACh dynamics using chemogenetics and
pharmacological approaches.
 Our preliminary data show that cholinergic projections from the pedunculopontine tegmentum (PPTg),
modulate excitability of vlPAG neurons. Under chronic pain conditions, we noted a decrease in ACh release in
vlPAG and reduced neuronal activity in PPTg. We also found that M2 muscarinic AChRs are expressed on
vlPAG neurons, and that pain increases the activity of these neurons. These observations lead us to
hypothesize that chronic pain lowers cholinergic signaling from PPTg and reduces M2 activity in vlPAG,
contributing to chronic pain symptoms. We further hypothesize that reversing these changes will relieve
somatic and affective symptoms of chronic pain.
 We will use an ACh sensor with in vivo fiber photometry to assess the impact of acute and chronic pain
on ACh release in the vlPAG. We will complement these assays using in vivo microdialysis for ACh. Brain slice
electrophysiology will be used to explore the pain-induced changes in synaptic drive and intrinsic excitability of
PPTg cholinergic neurons that project to vlPAG. In vivo imaging will be used to assess chronic pain induced
changes in vlPAG neuronal activity. Then, using chemogenetics and M2 mAChR agonists we will attempt to
reverse the pain-induced changes in excitability of vlPAG. Behavioral testing will confirm reversal of the
somatic and affective components of chronic pain. Better understanding of these modulatory inputs to
descending pain pathways will help identify novel targets for treating chronic pain."
10895429,"Cells are constantly exposed to exogenous and endogenous agents that chemically damage the genome. During
DNA replication, this chemical DNA damage can introduce mutations, chromosomal rearrangements, and
chromosome mis-segregation events that contribute to progression of cancer and ageing. DNA interstrand cross-
links (ICLs) are highly toxic DNA lesions that covalently link the two strands of DNA and block unwinding by the
replicative CDC45/MCM2-7/GINS (CMG) helicase. These lesions are generated by cancer chemotherapeutics,
endogenous metabolites, and microbiome toxins. Deficits in ICL repair cause the bone marrow failure and cancer
predisposition syndrome Fanconi anemia (FA). The products of genes implicated in FA participate in a common
ICL repair pathway that is activated when CMG collides with an ICL. Replication fork stalling at the ICL initiates
nucleolytic incisions that convert the ICL into a DNA double strand break (DSB). The DSB is itself a potential
source of genome instability that must be repaired by homologous recombination. In previous work, we used
Xenopus egg extracts to demonstrate that certain ICLs are repaired by an alternative pathway that is also
activated upon CMG collision with an ICL. In this pathway, the NEIL3 glycosylase cleaves an N-glycosyl bond in
the cross-link, resolving the ICL without DSB formation but generating a labile abasic (AP) site. Our work
indicated that the NEIL3 pathway is the preferred response for resolving a subset of ICLs, though the FA pathway
can process these lesions when NEIL3 is inactivated. We further showed that the AP site produced by NEIL3
forms a DNA-protein cross-link with the HMCES protein, which stabilizes the AP site and regulates mutagenic
DNA synthesis past the AP site. These results indicate that multiple functionally distinct pathways can cooperate
to promote efficient replication-coupled repair of DNA damage. In this proposal we will use approaches spanning
biochemistry, molecular biology, and cell biology to investigate how repair mechanisms are coordinated at the
replication fork during repair of physiologically- and clinically-relevant DNA lesions. In Aim 1, we will determine
the mechanisms of repair for an ICL formed by a bacteria toxin implicated in cancer progression, providing new
insight as to how the chemical structure of an ICL influences repair. In Aim 2, we will explore the repair of ICLs
by the NEIL3/HMCES pathway, including examining how this pathway is activated and how it regulates ICL
repair outcomes. In Aim 3, we will examine how HMCES regulates AP site metabolism and contributes to
genome stability in cells. These experiments will provide a deeper understanding of how different biochemical
repair activities are integrated at stalled replication forks. This work has the potential to inform therapeutic
interventions that modulate replication-coupled repair to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy or halt
progression of diseases caused by DNA repair deficiencies."
10875443,"Using Innovative Machine Learning to Detect Organized Support and Opposition to E-cigarette Use
Prevention Campaign Messaging on Twitter and TikTok
 In recent years sharp increases in the consumption of non-cigarette tobacco products, including vaping
products or electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), have largely offset the significant decline in cigarette
smoking rates in the US over the past five decades. In response, several state, local and federal tobacco
control programs have developed prevention campaign messages for youth vaping and e-cigarette use. Some
of these campaigns have also provoked significant opposition on social media from tobacco harm reduction
advocates.
 Strong evidence supports the effectiveness of anti-smoking media campaigns in preventing youth cigarette
smoking, but little research has examined the effects of campaigns that aim to prevent other types of tobacco
use, such as anti-vaping campaigns. Further, previous evidence about prevention campaign effects did not
take into account the current cluttered media environment, where campaign messages compete for audience
attention with tobacco product promotion messages and both supportive and oppositional messaging about the
campaigns themselves.
 Thus, social media interventions to prevent e-cigarette use are necessary but have unknown potential
effects in a competitive communication environment characterized by an influx of ENDS product marketing and
advocacy, potentially resulting in audience confusion and misinformation.
 Therefore, measuring engagement with e-cigarette use prevention campaigns on social media and
understanding the patterns of such engagement and information flow represent important advancements in the
science of prevention and lend evidential support for tobacco regulatory policy. The proposed project will
assess the e-cigarette use prevention-related content amount, reach, and engagement on social media (Aim
1); identify sources and major themes associated with both supportive and oppositional messages using
machine learning (Aim 2); and apply social network theories and approaches to examine patterns of social
media users’ information seeking, exposure, dissemination, and gatekeeping in the campaign periods over
time (Aim 3)."
10918230,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goals of the proposed research address the NHGRI strategic vision of improving how publicly funded
genomic repositories measure and report the impacts of their stewardship in novel computing environments.
More genomic and related health data are generated than can be securely accessed and shared, preventing
scientists’ ability to drive innovations that improve human health. New platforms powered by cloud technologies
are transforming how repositories FAIRify data at scale, making data more findable, accessible, interoperable
and reusable for otherwise compliant biomedical research. Moving repositories beyond regulatory compliance
to responsible stewardship of public data resources means aligning institutional practices for data release with
the values and interests of diverse stakeholders (e.g. data producers, users and contributors). The impacts of
genomic data stewardship have been challenging to capture in the cloud so far because we lack understanding
of what stewardship outcomes matter most to key stakeholders and how to measure these outcomes over time.
It is expected that most largescale genomic data collections will soon migrate to the cloud. The time is now for
developing a reliable tool that can track progress on genomic data stewardship ahead of these major
infrastructural upgrades. The proposed K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is designed to
build Dr. Rahimzadeh’s foundational knowledge in privacy engineering and law, and to develop core
competencies in impact assessment necessary to launch an independent research career at the nexus of
genomics, bioethics and data science. Dr. Rahimzadeh is an applied bioethicist with scientific training in
genomics. Her long-term career goal is to inform governance decisions which sustain public trust in and
maximize the scientific value of genomic data resources across the research lifecycle. The integrated training
and career development plan will be coordinated at the Center for Medical Ethics and Health Policy and
leverages the expertise of an interdisciplinary team of bioethicists, genomic researchers, privacy engineers and
data scientists. Dr. Rahimzadeh will partner with international data stewards responsible for managing
genetically diverse data collections across repositories represented in the Global Alliance for Genomics and
Health, H3Africa and the Native BioData Consortium to achieve the following specific aims: (AIM 1) Characterize
essential outcomes and develop assessment criteria for genomic data stewardship in the cloud using a modified
Delphi study design; Validate a stewardship impact assessment tool with experts in cloud infrastructure design
(AIM2A) and pilot test the tool’s implementation with managers across cloud-native repositories (AIM2B)."
10873254,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Three-dimensional (3D) microscopy offers many promises for biological investigations and medical
applications. However, it is currently limited to well-resourced laboratories in settings with established
infrastructure. Many 3D microscopy techniques (e.g., confocal) rely on focusing light at an array of small
locations within the sample, which requires expensive and specialized equipment. Optical Projection
Tomography (OPT) is a 3D imaging technique that utilizes traditional microscopy equipment; instead of
focusing the light at specific locations, OPT images a sample from many angles to reconstruct a 3D volume.
It is a very effective method for 3D imaging of small translucent objects (e.g., mouse fetuses, parasites, and
large bacteria). While it is possible for OPT to be a lower-cost method of 3D microscopy, existing systems
remain expensive and large. We propose to take advantage of the ubiquitous and high-quality computing
and imaging hardware available in smartphones to make an OPT device that is inexpensive and extremely
portable. We will create a smartphone extension that robustly images a rotating sample and uses the
phone’s computational hardware to reconstruct the 3D volume. Two imaging modalities will be pursued:
visible-band attenuation microscopy (e.g., brightfield) and luminescent microscopy (e.g., bioluminescent).
The components of the smartphone extension are either 3D printed, laser cut acrylic, or readily commercially
available. Thus, the cost of manufacturing the device is extremely small and the total weight of the device is
very low; the total cost of all components will be less than $50. The components of the extension are easily
assembled on site, permitting the device to be transported with in a small package. Due to its low cost and
size, the OPT microscope can also serve as a useful tool for educational purposes (e.g., as part of an
undergraduate laboratory course involving optics) and for generating real data for tomographic algorithm
development. To validate the device, we will build two phantoms with three-dimensional features that allow
us to evaluate the Modulation Transfer Function: one for attenuation microscopy and another for luminescent
microscopy. Aim 1: Build a visible-band tomographic microscope extension to a smartphone. Aim 1A:
Implement 3D cone-beam reconstruction from visible-band sinogram data for samples approximately 10 mm
in size with approximately 10 µm resolution. Aim 1B: Improve the image resolution with a multi-lens optical
system. Aim 2: Implement bioluminescent tomographic microscopy by appropriately modifying the
tomographic reconstruction algorithm. Aim 3: Build two shelf-stable 3D phantoms with features of sizes
varying from 1 µm to 200 µm."

 There remains a need to develop biomarker tests for personalized risk assessment of breast and ovarian
cancers. Such tests would not replace screening programs but would instead be a basic tool that can be
integrated with other risk models based on a subject’s characteristics to personalize the risk of harboring cancer
and inform on the need for screening and surveillance for earlier detection.
 The primary translational objective of this proposal is to develop a multi-analyte blood-based
biomarker panel based on circulating proteins and autoantibodies against tumor antigens that inform about a
subject’s probability of harboring a breast or ovarian cancer. Studies by the applicant team have led to the
identification of a panel of cancer-relevant circulating proteins as well as autoantibodies against tumor proteins,
including TP53 and novel citrullinated antigens, for detection of breast and ovarian cancers. The PLCO cohort
is an excellent resource to further advance testing of candidate biomarkers and to also establish combination
rules together with subject characteristics for individualized risk assessment of breast and ovarian cancers to
optimized screening and surveillance for earlier detection of these diseases.
In Specific Aim 1, leveraging pre-diagnostic plasmas from 969 breast cancer cases and 106 ovarian cancer
cases as well as four times the number of non-case plasmas from female PLCO participants that did not develop
cancer during study follow-up, we will assess the time-dependent (e.g. 0-1 year, 1-2 years, etc) predictive
performance (AUC, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV))
of candidate biomarkers for detection of breast and ovarian cancers. Priority biomarker candidates will be
advanced to establish models together with pertinent patient characteristics (e.g. Gail Model for breast cancer)
for 1-year risk prediction of BrCa and OvCa. For modeling, we will adhere to the Predictability, Computability and
Stability framework. The entire PLCO specimen set will be divided into a Development Set and a Set-Aside Test
Set. Modeling and tuning of hyperparameters as well as initial validation will be performed in the Development
Set. The model with the best predictive performance (AUC) in the Development Set will be selected for
subsequent testing in the Set-Aside Test Set. In Specific Aim 2, we will leverage serial samples procured from
cases preceding a diagnosis of a BrCa or OvCa and serial samples for non-cases, and we will test
whether longitudinal trajectories of biomarker panel scores improve risk prediction. The proposed study
represents a validation of cancer-associated protein and autoantibody biomarkers and has high probability to
develop a blood test that can be implemented in the clinical setting for individualized risk assessment of breast
and ovarian cancers."
10891709,"Abstract. The objective of this research is to identify carbohydrate-compatible photolabile protecting groups
and light sources to facilitate the parallel on-surface synthesis of high-density glycan microarrays—e.g. glycan
chips—in a manner similar to the synthesis of gene chips. Instead of using monochromatic light and a single
photolabile protecting group to spatially control the extension of a linear polymer (DNA) on the microchip, as in
gene chip manufacture, irradiation with different wavelengths of light combined with wavelength-selective tem-
porary protecting groups will allow for constructing complex, branched glycans on a microchip surface. I aim to:
(1) identify carbohydrate-compatible photolabile protecting groups and optimal light sources to pair with each;
and (2) identify a pair of wavelength-selective (`chromatically orthogonal') protecting groups and demonstrate
their use in branched glycan synthesis, paving the way towards the parallel on-chip synthesis of high-density
glycan microarrays. Wavelength-selective photochemistry will be achieved by separating the absorptions of pho-
tolabile protecting groups to allow for selective excitation. Such high-density combinatorially-synthesized glycan
chips are expected to permit rapid epitope mapping and screening of the selectivity of glycan binding partners.
For example, exposing a dye-labeled lectin, antibody, or virus/bacteria/pathogen binding protein to the chip will
allow its binding specificity for numerous glycan structures to be determined from a single experiment. The ability
to synthesize high-density combinatorial libraries of carbohydrates will aid in resolving the structure-function
relationships of carbohydrates, help to understand the target epitopes of glycan binding partners, and accelerate
efforts to uncover the structure and function of the glycome."
10915562,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) contributes strongly to the development of insulin resistance, and the
two mutually regulate each other in type 2 diabetes. In the liver of NAFLD and insulin resistance, hundreds to
thousands of genes are either upregulated or downregulated. Epigenetic modifications such as histone
methylation and acetylation modulate homochromatin or heterochromatin states to enhance or suppress gene
expression in a context-dependent manner. However, significant knowledge gaps exist in mapping the epigenetic
landscape and identifying the major epigenetic factors regulating the development of NAFLD and insulin
resistance. In the current proposal, we take advantage of the newly developed CUT&TAG technology and create
an epigenetic landscape of histone modifications, including H3K4me1 (poised marker), H3K4me2, and H3K27ac
(active marker), and H3K9me2 (suppressive marker) in the liver of mouse and human NAFLD. A comprehensive
analysis of the histone modification landscape identifies RE1 Silencing Transcription Factor (REST) as an
epigenetic modulator that coordinates the activity of these histone markers. REST recruits histone deacetylases
(HDAC1&2), which deacetylate H3K27ac, and lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), which demethylates
H3K4me1 and H3K9me2, to regulate gene expression. Our preliminary data show that nuclear REST protein
levels are increased in the liver of mouse and human NAFLD. Insulin and glucose treatment of cultured
hepatocytes mimicking insulin resistance drives REST nuclear translocation. Knocking down REST using REST
antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) in the liver of adult obese mice (REST-LKD) alleviates fatty liver and improves
glucose and insulin tolerance. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies show that REST knockdown in the
liver increases glucose uptake in adipose tissue and muscle, indicating crosstalk between the liver and adipose
tissue/muscle. These data show that hepatic REST is activated in insulin resistance, and the activated REST
promotes the development of NAFLD and insulin resistance, forming a vicious cycle. Our central hypothesis is
that REST is the key epigenetic factor orchestrating histone methylation and acetylation to regulate lipid and
glucose metabolism in NAFLD and insulin resistance. We propose three aims to investigate what causes REST
activation in NAFLD and insulin resistance, why the activated REST promotes NAFLD and insulin resistance,
and how the activated REST induces systemic insulin resistance. Aim 1: To determine the mechanisms for the
increased REST activity in the liver of NAFLD. Aim 2: To elucidate the mechanisms by which hepatic REST
regulates lipid and glucose metabolism. Aim 3: To investigate the mechanisms for improved systemic insulin
sensitivity in REST-LKD mice. Successful execution of the proposal will fill the knowledge gap by mapping the
epigenetic landscape and identifying REST as a key epigenetic factor that reprograms metabolic gene profiles
in NAFLD and insulin resistance."

Brain metastasis (BrM) is the most common intracranial tumor in adults. Despite advanced therapies, BrM
remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with lung cancer. The mechanisms underlying BrM
progression and immune evasion remain poorly understood.
Fibroblasts are abundant in the lung cancers that have metastasized to the brain, but functions of fibroblasts in
BrM are still not known. In our preliminary studies, metastasis-associated fibroblasts (MAFs) promote BrM growth
through a soluble form of placental growth factor (PGF). MAF-derived PGF protect cancer cells from treatment
with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and induce immunosuppressive environment in BrM. Based on these
observations, we propose that MAFs-derived PGF supports BrM growth in two ways: 1) directly by stimulating
the proliferation and chemoresistance of cancer cells; 2) indirectly by inducing an immunosuppressive tumor
microenvironment. This hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims: 1) determine how MAF-derived PGF
directly regulates the proliferation and TKI resistance of cancer cells in BrM. 2) determine how MAF-derived PGF
causes immunosuppression in BrM.
Our studies will establish the importance of MAF-derived PGF in inducing TKI resistance and
immunosuppression in BrM. PGF neutralizing antibodies efficiently penetrate the brain, and already show
promise in treating primary brain tumors, both in preclinical studies and in ongoing clinical trials. Our studies will
provide strong mechanistic rationale and pave the way for therapeutic use of PGF antibodies in treating BrM."
10909208,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic gene-marking phenomenon that causes a subset of mammalian genes (i.e.
imprinted genes) to be expressed from only one of the two parental copies. The majority of imprinted genes are
arranged in chromosomal clusters. Each cluster has an imprinting control region (ICR) with one or more
differentially methylated regions (DMRs) - regions marked by DNA methylation on only one allele - which act
as the epigenetic signal that controls monoallelic expression. Imprinted DMRs are classified as germline
(primary) DMRs (gDMRs) and somatic (secondary) DMRs (sDMRs). gDMRs are established during
gametogenesis, resulting from differential de novo methylation of male and female germ cells. sDMRs represents
allele-specific methylation acquired during embryonic development. Genetic studies have demonstrated that the
de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A is responsible for the establishment of methylation imprints at gDMRs
during germ cell development and that the maintenance enzyme DNMT1 is responsible for maintaining
methylation imprints during embryonic development and in adult tissues. Despite these advances, fundamental
questions remain to be answered, e.g. How sexually dimorphic patterns of DNA methylation in gametes are
regulated? And how gDNAs control sDMRs? Preliminary studies in the applicant’s laboratory showed that
conditional ablation of the arginine methyltransferase PRMT7 in male germ cells results in incomplete
methylation of the gDMR at the H19-Igf2 imprinted locus in sperm. As a result, the progeny show biallelic
repression of Igf2 and allelic switch in H19 and Gtl2 expression (Gtl2 is also a paternally imprinted gene). The
applicant’s laboratory also showed that PRMT7 catalyzes monomethylation of DNMT3A at a conserved arginine
residue in the N-terminal region that is important for functional specificity of DNMT3A. The applicant
hypothesizes that PRMT7, through methylating DNMT3A, regulates DNMT3A-mediated de novo methylation,
including the establishment of paternal imprints, during male germ cell development and that, in the absence of
PRMT7, impaired DNA methylation on the paternal alleles causes secondary trans-effect changes on the
maternal alleles after fertilization, resulting in allelic switch in the expression of some paternally imprinted genes.
To test the hypothesis, the applicant proposes two specific aims: 1) Determine the role of PRMT7 in de novo
DNA methylation during male germ cell development; and 2) Elucidate the mechanism underlying allelic switch
of paternally imprinted genes in the offspring of PRMT7-deficient male mice. In the applicant’s opinion, the
proposed research is innovative for its conceptual novelty. The project is significant, because results from the
proposed studies are expected to provide novel insights into the regulation of de novo DNA methylation in the
male germline and the crosstalk between the paternal and maternal alleles to control monoallelic expression of
imprinted genes."
10932237,"Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) and angiogenesis occur together in the neurogenic niche of the
hippocampus dentate gyrus (DG) and support cognitive functions and behavioral responses to stress in rodents.
Connectivity between newborn and existing granule neurons is fundamental for these functions. We found that
normally aging (NA) subjects into their eighth decade of life have a stable number of progenitor cells (NPCs) and
immature neurons, but angiogenesis and neuroplasticity are decreased with aging and directly correlated with
each other, suggesting that, even if AHN occurs in older adults, the vascular support and connectivity of newborn
neurons might be reduced. Moreover, we do not know if more NPCs differentiate into glia in older individuals, as
it happens in aging rodents. AHN is lower in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), and if NPCs preferentially differentiate
into glia or do not, divide, differentiate and mature efficiently, remains unknown. We investigated expression of
Kruppel Like Factor 9 (Klf9), a transcription factor necessary for neurogenesis-dependent synaptic plasticity, and
we found an age-associated decline in Klf9 expression. We further tested if the observed age-associated
angiogenesis decline could be due to reduced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2
(VEGFR2), which regulates both angiogenesis and AHN. Our pilot data show that number of intra- and extra-
vascular cells expressing VEGFR2 are fewer with aging. Altered vascular and dendrite/spine plasticity could
contribute to NA and AD, and isolating key molecular regulators could lead to designing new treatments for AD.
Here we propose to assess hypothesis-generated molecular targets, and in a parallel project (1R01AG076949),
we have proposed to perform, in the same 140 subjects and brain region, proteomics, single nucleus and spatial
multiomics (RNA and ATAC) sequencing, using data driven approaches which could reveal unanticipated
molecular underpinnings of brain aging and AD. The approach proposed here allows combined visualization of
selected molecular targets at the single cell level, and detailed anatomical mapping of cell, capillary, dendrite
and spine structure and connectivity. Our rigorous methods assure detailed clinical assessment, brain tissue
quality, uniform tissue processing, use of toxicology and neuropathology, and strict inclusion/exclusion criteria.
We will study hippocampi from NIMH, Columbia University Taub Institute Brain Bank (see letter), and the
Columbia/NYSPI brain collection. We will assess aging effects in NA subjects (N=100, age 14-90 years, 57
males and 43 females), and will assess how NA differs from AD comparing NA subjects aged 60 and older with
age- and sex-matched AD subjects (N=40, Braak stages 1 through 4). Aims are to quantify: (1) Neuronal and
glial differentiation of NPCs. (2) Dendrites, spines and synapses, and their molecular regulators: 2a. Golgi-
stained dendrites and spines; 2b. Neurofilament-immunoreactive dendrites; 2c. Spine and synaptic proteins
spinophilin, SYN1 and PSD95; 2d. Klf9 mRNA. (3) Angiogenesis and VEGFR2. (4) Relationships between
cellular and morphological data from Aims 1-3, and AD Braak stages, stress exposure, education level and sex."

In the U.S., an estimated 1.4 million people identify as transgender (TG), defined as a person whose gender is
different than their sex assigned at birth, and are a designated minority population by the NIH (NOT-MD-19-001).
Many TG persons take gender-affirming hormone therapy, usually estrogen or testosterone based, to alter their
physical appearance and improve their psychological health. Lifetime exposure to estrogen is a well-established
risk factor for breast cancer (BC). Despite a growing TG population, the risk of developing BC in TG persons is
unclear and there is no consensus on how to ideally screen this undeserved population for BC. These knowledge
gaps prevent informed decision-making among healthcare providers and TG persons, likely contributing to the
cancer disparities observed in the TG community. The overarching goal of my research agenda is to develop
evidence-based TG BC screening guidelines. The proposed K08 will begin to fill critical knowledge gaps. In
collaboration with our LGBTQ+ Inclusion Health Clinic, we will establish a pilot BC screening program and utilize
a mixed methods approach to explore BC risk and screening in this population. These data will provide the
necessary foundation to develop a multi-institutional longitudinal TG BC screening cohort study which will inform
the development of BC screening guidelines and best practices for BC screening within the TG community. The
foundational K08 work will be accomplished through three specific aims: 1) determine the callback and biopsy
rates of TG persons after screening mammography and automated breast ultrasonography, 2) assess
perceptions towards BC risk, screening, and the screening experience of TG individuals through surveys and
interviews, and 3) identify individual and systems-level barriers to BC screening for TG persons and methods to
optimize the screening process through interviews and focus groups. These findings will provide the first-ever
prospective scientific data on screening mammography and automated breast ultrasonography lesion detection
in TG persons. The qualitative data from Aims 2 and 3 will identify individual and systems-level barriers to
screening and opportunities to improve the screening process and experience. The research proposal is
complemented by a comprehensive and distinctive training plan focused on mixed methods and survey research,
gender studies, database development, and cohort recruitment and retention. In combination with my diverse
and collaborative mentorship team, this study and training plan is designed to optimize my seamless transition
to becoming an independently funded surgeon–scientist and my efforts to mitigate BC disparities in TG persons
through a 3-step process. The novel pilot BC screening study (Step 1) will provide the necessary preliminary
data and experience to submit an R01 application to develop a multi-institutional longitudinal TG BC screening
program (Step 2) which will definitively establish the lifetime risk and incidence of BC to inform the development
of evidence-based BC screening guidelines for TG persons and best practice guidelines (Step 3)."
10899584,"Both social isolation and cognitive decline are urgent threats to public health, as they
predispose persons to Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. Air pollution and the built
environment are community-based factors that have been shown to adversely affect cognitive
function. Individual factors such as social isolation and economic disadvantage further
contribute to cognitive risk. Rural settings have more limited opportunities for social
engagement, when compared to urban settings. These conditions converge to form a perfect
storm of social isolation and accelerated cognitive decline, yet prior studies have not focused on
rural, disadvantaged, ethnic minority residents. Using a multi-method approach, we propose to
demonstrate how a uniquely vulnerable rural Florida population (N = 1087) are at risk for social
isolation and decline in cognitive function due to the unique characteristics of the physical and
social environment. We will recruit community-dwelling, non-clinical, dementia-free, middle aged
and older adults from 5 communities in the Lake Okeechobee area of Florida for a 5-year study
incorporating time-series individual social and cognitive measures and community-level
measures of the physical and built environment. Apple watches will be used by a subsample of
120 participants representative of 5 communities to continuously monitor sensory data, daily
routine and predefined activities for 2 months. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) will be
used to collect data daily over periods of agricultural burning and no burning.
Using a combination of primary data collection, secondary data analysis, subsample continuous
monitoring and EMA, we will examine the following aims over 36 months among rural,
racially/ethnically, and linguistically diverse underserved community-dwelling adults aged 45
years and older:
Aim 1: Examine the contribution of smoke-related PM2.5 exposures to SI and cognitive
function, through multilevel growth modeling.
Aim 2. Determine the effects of the built (e.g., retail destinations, park space) and social
environment (e.g., crime SES) on social isolation and cognitive function through mixed linear
modeling.
Aim 3. Contextualize social isolation and cognitive function among residents from different
racial/ethnic groups using EMA and sensor-derived behavior models with a subsample of 120
stratified by Lake O communities during burn and non-burn seasons."

Dr. Ural is a Postdoctoral Scientist in Dr. Donna Farber’s lab working on identifying alterations in the immune
system of aging lung and lung-associated lymph nodes. As demographics are changing across many parts of
the world, age related lung diseases are expected to become a major healthcare burden. Recent studies have
shown that lung function starts to decline after third decade of life, and this leads to increased mortality rate in
elderly people due to infectious and non-infectious lung diseases. Human aging is shaped with prolonged
exposure to the environment; however, due to limited availability of healthy pulmonary tissues, the impact of
environmental exposures (e.g., air pollution) to the aging immune system is not well studied.
Macrophages are a diverse population of cells that perform specialized tissue functions. Environmental
exposures such as air pollution can have direct effect on the local immune system and pulmonary macrophages
are among the first cell types to respond to all the environmental exposures for tissue homeostasis and
surveillance. However, macrophage studies in human tissues are very limited due to limited availability of such
tissues. It is important to elucidate how aging pulmonary macrophage immunity changes with environmental
exposures in order to develop effective immune therapies to recently encountered pathogens. Dr. Donna
Farber’s lab has a unique collaboration with a local procurement organization to obtain multiple tissue sites from
healthy brain-dead organ donors. Our studies showed that carbon particulates accumulate in human lung
draining lymph nodes (LLN) with age while the corresponding mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) show no
particulate matter. Carbon particulates are contained within a subset of lymph node macrophages, and this leads
to reduced activation and phagocytosis with impaired production of cytokines in this macrophage subset.
Moreover, these alterations in aging LLNs disrupt B cell follicle integrity with reduction in lymphatics, which is not
observed in MLNs. Our central hypothesis is that the environmental particulates are contained within a specific
pulmonary macrophage subset because of its distinct localization and due to these particulates, aging pulmonary
macrophages have altered transcriptional profile, with compromised respiratory immune response. The aims of
this proposal are 1) Evaluate functional properties of human pulmonary macrophage population that takes up
environmental particulates over age. 2) Evaluate the phagocytosis and migration potential of aging pulmonary
macrophages and how macrophages with atmospheric particulate matter respond to recently encountered
pathogens over age. This career award will give Dr. Ural the opportunity to advance her training and experience
on macrophage aging, using innovative approaches such as two-photon imaging, CODEX imaging, and
computational analysis of high dimensional transcriptomics data. This award will comprehensively prepare Dr.
Ural for her future career as an independent pulmonary researcher studying the role of aging in tissue specific
immune regulation."

Cardiovascular disease including myocardial infarction represents one of the leading causes of death worldwide.
Despite currently available treatments, myocardial infarction remains a major index event which can lead to
progression of heart failure. Current therapies focus on preventing the progression of adverse remodeling
including development of fibrosis. However, little progress has been made in the development of treatments to
prevent or reverse this remodeling.
In recent years, it has been demonstrated that cardiac injury elicits an immense immune response involving the
majority of known immune cell types. In recent years, it has also been demonstrated that the recruitment of
monocytes leads to incredible diversity in macrophage populations with distinct expression profiles. Experiments
in both mice and humans in numbers cardiovascular diseases has demonstrated this diversity. In this proposal,
the PI aims to investigate how and when these diverse macrophage populations obtain their fate and
investigate the potential of interferon signaling as a regulator of this diversification.
The scientific goals of this award are to identify the spatiotemporal dynamics of macrophage recruitment and
specification after cardiac injury. By the end of this award period, the PI aims to establish when monocytes
entering the heart acquire their specific macrophage transcriptional profile as observed to be highly diverse in
prior experiments. The PI will utilize new technologies including intravital 2-photon imaging and advanced
computational biology techniques. The PI will also identify the role of interferon signaling in the specification of
macrophage populations as well as in repair and inflammation after cardiac injury. This will be completed by
modulating interferon signaling in recruited monocytes. At the end of this award period, the PI will have generated
a better understanding of how the complex immune response to heart injury occurs.
The career development goal of this proposal is to aid in the PI’s success in becoming an independent
investigator. The PI has previously obtained a PhD in developmental biology and completed 3 years of
postdoctoral training in cardiac immunology. The proposed 2-year mentored research time under this award will
provide the PI with formal training in immunology, computational biology, and grant-writing. Additionally, the
mentorship team and advisory committee will provide training and advice on technical skills, management skills,
and making early career decisions. By completing this award period, the PI will have acquired the skills necessary
to become a successful independent researcher."
10767994,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The long-term goal of the proposed research is to determine the neural pathways by which physiological
signals regulate gonadotropin secretion, which ultimately determines reproductive function. Modulation of
luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion determines fertility and controls gonadal steroid concentrations, which has
profound effects on cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and mental health. Pulses of luteinizing hormone secretion
are organized by neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus that contain kisspeptin, neurokinin B and
dynorphin (KNDy neurons) in males and females. In females, the preovulatory LH surge is induced by estradiol
and is dependent upon kisspeptin cells in the anteroventral periventricular region (AVPVKiss1). However, the
higher order neural circuitry that governs these populations of kisspeptin cells remains a significant
outstanding question. The nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) is located in the brainstem and consists of a
heterogenous population of neurons that receive rich interoceptive and central inputs and projects widely thought
the brain. Interestingly, these neurons are implicated in both the inhibition of pulsatile LH secretion during stress,
and the facilitation of enhanced LH secretion during the preovulatory LH surge. To address this apparent
paradox, this K99/R00 proposal will test the central hypothesis that distinct subpopulations of neurons in
the NTS suppress pulsatile LH secretion via inhibition of KNDy neurons and enhance LH secretion via
activation of AVPVKiss1 cells. During the mentored phase, we will employ viral-mediated cell activation labeling
techniques and light sheet microscopy of optically cleared tissue to determine if the same neurons are activated
during stress and the LH surge, as well as single-cell RNA sequencing to identify the subpopulations of NTS
neurons that are activated during stress and the LH surge (Aim 1). The mentored phase will consist of critical
training in advanced neuroanatomical and neuroimaging techniques, next generation sequencing technologies,
bioinformatic analysis, as well as career development experiences that are necessary for transitioning to an
independent academic research position. In the independent phase, I propose to use chemogenetic and cell-
specific viral-mediated neural ablation techniques to determine whether subpopulations of neurons identified in
Aim 1 are sufficient and necessary for stress-induced suppression of LH secretion and KNDy cell activation (Aim
2) or for the preovulatory LH surge and AVPVKiss1 cell activation (Aim 3) and determine the locations in the brain
these subpopulations project (Aims 2 & 3). These studies will launch my independent research program and will
provide a neural framework that may influence the development of therapies to treat disorders of altered LH
secretion, including amenorrhea, infertility, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Collectively, the commitment of the
sponsoring/co-sponsoring team to my scientific and professional development, coupled with the stimulating
academic environment and impressive resources at UC San Diego available to me will ensure achievement of
the aims of this Career Development proposal and the training mission of UC San Diego and the NIH."

Heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome that is driven by impaired myocardial contractile
performance. Several metabolic alterations contribute to heart failure, including mitochondrial
dysfunction and changes in cardiac substrate utilization, resulting in energy deficiency and
reduced cardiomyocyte contractility. Current therapies for heart failure treat the symptoms rather
than the mechanisms underlying the etiology of the disease and are unable to reverse the
molecular changes that occur in diseased cardiomyocytes. Developing novel approaches to
enhance mitochondrial function and modulate cardiac metabolism in heart failure is a promising
approach towards correcting myocardial energetics to restore heart function. Despite the central
role that mitochondria play in cardiac health and disease, we are still lacking critical insight into
how many fundamental mitochondrial processes are regulated at the molecular level. Recent
computational and experimental data suggest that the mammalian genome contains thousands
of previously overlooked small proteins called microproteins, and hundreds of these have been
linked to the mitochondria where they are thought to play important roles as regulatory molecules.
Examples of mitochondrial microproteins (MitoMPs) have been shown to regulate essential
mitochondrial processes including cellular respiration, substrate utilization, metabolism and stress
signaling. MitoMPs typically manifest their functions by binding to and regulating larger protein
partners or multiprotein complexes within membrane domains. In line with this, we recently
discovered 2 novel MitoMPs named MOXI (micropeptide regulator of b-oxidation) and
mitolamban, which each interact with discrete metabolic regulatory complexes to perform distinct
functions. MOXI plays a critical role in regulating long chain fatty acid oxidation, likely through a
direct interaction with the mitochondrial trifunctional protein (MTP), while mitolamban interacts
with complex III of the electron transport chain and contributes to complex assembly and function.
Here we propose a comprehensive research plan to dissect the molecular mechanisms of action
of MOXI (Aim 1) and mitolamban (Aim 2) in the heart using gain- and loss-of-function mouse
models. Additionally, we aim to evaluate their potential as therapeutic targets using experimental
models of heart failure and ischemic heart disease. Furthermore, towards the goal of gaining a
more complete understanding of mitochondrial biology in the heart, we propose the functional
analysis of 3 newly identified MitoMPs (Aim 3). We hypothesize that these microproteins play
unique roles in regulating distinct aspects of mitochondrial function and metabolism and that their
functional characterization could give rise to novel targets for heart failure therapeutics."

This proposal is in response to the funding opportunity Research Project Grant (Parent R01 Clinical Trial
Required), FOA number PAR-20-183. This proposal aims to identify specific biomarkers in individual people
with osteoarthritis (OA) pain that will allow definition of responder phenotypes distinct for different therapeutic
interventions. A mechanistic, prospective randomized trial will be undertaken, treating people having moderate
to severe OA pain with either naproxen (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID)), duloxetine (a selective
serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. Randomization will be stratified by sex
and prior opioid use. Naproxen, duloxetine and placebo are known to have different mechanisms of action and
work at different sites in the pain pathway. Hence, it would be expected that these distinctions would be reflected
in differences in individuals who would respond to each of these interventions. To this end, during the study we
will collect a wide variety of biomarkers including demographics (sex, age), clinical outcome measures,
questionnaires of patient-reported outcomes, neurosensory status (quantitative sensory testing indices), serum-
based biomarkers, and joint and brain imaging. The treatment for each participant and collection of biomarkers
will occur during an initial 6-week period and then be repeated after a 4-week washout to account for the known
within-patient variability. The results obtained will permit the identification of responders (defined by 30% or
greater improvement in pain from baseline with other thresholds also evaluated), and the correlation of biomarker
status at baseline to response. We will then build a model to define the responder phenotype for each
intervention, first using only clinical data and secondly using both clinical and MRI-based brain data. The latter
will permit a further understanding of the mechanisms involved in modulation of the pain pathways by each of
the agents. Particular attention will be given to treatment by sex interactions. The characterization of responder
phenotypes to NSAID, duloxetine and placebo will allow for the practice of personalized medicine, providing the
right drug to the right patient, enhancing therapeutic success, and reducing the risks involved with being treated
with ineffective drugs having serious potential side effects. In addition, this approach will allow for more targeted
and more efficient development of potential new therapeutic agents to treat OA pain."

This proposal details work for the third cycle (2023-2028) of the Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium
(CKD-PC). A global public health problem, CKD affects >10% of the world population and is a leading cause of
death. The CKD-PC – a global group of ~300 investigators representing >100 cohorts with >30 million
individuals from >40 countries – has played an important role in facilitating major advances in the staging of
CKD, the identification of surrogate endpoint for clinical trials, and the establishment of a range of risk tools for
use in clinical care (ckdpc.org). The CKD-PC uses an efficient, fluid consortium structure, centralized analytics,
and innovative meta-analysis methods to advance epidemiologic research in CKD prognosis at the highest
level of rigor, productivity, and clinical impact. In this phase, we aim to inform guidelines in kidney disease with
evidence on CKD prevalence and progression; elucidate the role of CKD in the risk of heart failure,
arrhythmias, infections, cancer, frailty, and dementia; and evaluate the performance of kidney and CKD-related
risk tools in different clinical settings. Current challenges include: quantifying the implications of the 2021 CKD-
EPI equations world-wide; determining when and how often cystatin C should be tested; and identifying
situations in which local adaptations of risk calculators for kidney and CKD-related outcomes are warranted.
We will work to continue to increase regional representation, enhancing generalizability, and to incorporate
additional clinical trials in order to map observed risks to real-world data to inform guideline-recommended
thresholds for treatment. We remain flexible and efficient in responding to high priority topics set forth by
guideline organizations and regulatory bodies such as the US Food and Drug Administration, and for
collaboration with other consortia, including the Global Burden of Disease. Our overarching aim is to improve
the health of patients with or at risk for CKD."

There is strong national consensus about the need to deliver high-quality care at the end of life (EOL) for
patients with advanced (distant metastasis) cancer. Yet, despite the efforts of healthcare providers, many
patients receive care that they do not want at EOL and leave their informal caregivers struggling with
complicated grief months after their death. Research, to date, has tended to define quality EOL care using
unidimensional factors that do not encompass key aspects of EOL care, such as patient and family-centered
EOL care that holds individual preferences for EOL care at its core. Specifically, quality EOL care has been
defined in terms of either: (a) amount of aggressive health care services received, or (b) whether it was “goal
concordant care”---care that aligned with the patient’s preferences and goals for EOL care. These approaches
have provided limited perspectives of what constitutes quality EOL care. Aggressiveness metrics (e.g., days of
hospitalization, number of emergency department visits), for example, ignore the fact that some patients want
aggressive care at EOL and goal concordant care metrics ignore the post-death QOL of caregivers. It is
usually the patient-caregiver dyad who experience the trajectory of care, and who need support throughout.
With patients continuing to receive EOL care that they do not want and caregivers struggling with poor post-
death outcomes such as complicated grief, we need a new paradigm for conceptualizing quality EOL care.
This project will be the first to apply the principles of a dyadic theory of illness to examine the relationships
between patient-caregiver dyadic factors (e.g., dyadic incongruence for patient symptom severity) and dyadic
quality EOL care. We have reconceptualized quality EOL care to be care that benefits both members of the
dyad and is present when the patient identifies the receipt of goal concordant care at EOL and the caregiver
does not demonstrate complicated grief 3 months post-death. This longitudinal, descriptive, correlational study
will address the following aims: Aim 1: Examine the influence of dyadic appraisal of illness factors upon dyadic
quality EOL care (present or absent); Aim 2: Examine the influence of risk-protective contextual factors
(individual, dyadic, family/social) on dyadic appraisal of illness factors (symptoms, EOL treatment preferences,
EOL values) over time; and Aim 3: Assess the extent to which dyadic appraisal of illness factors mediate the
relationship between risk-protective contextual factors and dyadic quality EOL care. Identifying specific dyadic
variables (such as symptom severity incongruence) that relate to dyadic outcomes can facilitate the
development of dyadic interventions aimed at enhancing communication or knowledge, for example, for both
members of the dyad over time. By enhancing dyadic outcomes, we will have better stewardship of healthcare
resources for patients at EOL and ensure improved quality EOL care for patients and improved post-death
outcomes for caregivers---those who must carry on after the patient’s death."

The ability to control biomolecules in situ is critical to the experimental process. Proteins are especially
important to understand as they are central to cellular function, cell signaling, and living organism processes
(e.g. metabolism, tissue development, and immune function). There is an unmet need for a small molecule
approach to “tunably” and reversibly regulate expression of an imaging-compatible protein tag to investigate
protein function(s). Such a tag would allow multi-modal imaging, including fluorescence and in vivo positron
emission tomography (PET), allowing investigators to detect, then control, the tagged protein in cells and
animals using small molecule ligands. For example, fluorescence imaging of the tag could guide the proper
timing for protein knock-down based on subcellular localization or protein-protein interactions in vitro, and PET
imaging of the tag could guide the regulation of proteins modulating cellular trafficking in vivo. A specific
example of the in vivo application is in the process of developing chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell
therapies for solid tumors, where understanding in vivo biodistribution, efficacy, and toxicity using imaging
would be crucial, and importantly, controlling the cell surface expression of the CAR may have a large impact
on that biodistribution, efficacy, and off-tumor toxicity. Chemical derivatives of the small molecule antibiotic
trimethoprim (TMP) have been developed into multi-modality imaging probes by our group and others. The
objective of this proposal is to set a standard for imaging-compatible protein regulation tags that can be widely
adopted. We propose proteolysis targeting chimeric small molecules (PROTACs) based on TMP that target E.
coli dihydrofolate reductase (eDHFR) tagged fusion proteins with high affinity. Our proof-of-concept molecules
covalently link TMP and pomalidomide (POM), a ligand for the E3 ligase Cereblon. A lead compound, TMP-
POM 7c robustly regulates diverse proteins, from optical reporter proteins, such as YFP and luciferase, to
transcription factors and therapeutic membrane-bound proteins, such as CARs, in primary human T-cells.
Optimization, characterization, and application of these compounds is needed, especially in terms of
understanding the impact of linker length and composition, as well as pharmacokinetic properties, to lay the
groundwork for a distributable prototype(s) that can be applied broadly in biomedical science. This approach
represents a technological leap forward by uniting small molecule protein regulation of a versatile protein tag
with fluorescence imaging probes and PET radiotracers for in vivo imaging."

Candidate: Ari B. Friedman, MD, PhD is junior faculty at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). He practices
clinically as an emergency physician and conducts research as a health economist into how care systems
affect patients' lives. He is passionate about improving the care and outcomes of the many older patients that
he sees in the emergency department (ED) by improving the science underlying that care.
Goal: The purpose of this K23 Career Development Award is to enable Dr. Friedman to gain knowledge and
skills necessary to become an independent investigator focusing on the emergent care of older patients.
Research Context: Visits to hospital EDs are a growing source of care for adults over 65, totaling 22.4 million
visits in 2017. Among older patients, abdominal pain is the single most common chief complaint. Simply being
over 65 years, presenting to an ED, and stating at triage, “I have abdominal pain,” as a chief complaint confers
a mortality rate as high or higher than an ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI), with equivalently high
morbidity. Yet little is known about this phenomenon, especially for patients with frailty or cognitive impairment.
Career Development Plan: Dr. Friedman seeks training in frailty, cognitive impairment and dementia,
geriatrics, primary data collection, and health disparities. This award will provide protected time for Dr.
Friedman to acquire the skills necessary to secure independent funding through a progressive, milestone-
driven training plan that includes coursework, mentored research, and guided independent study.
Aims: The central hypothesis of this proposal is that there are identifiable ways to improve the evaluation and
management of abdominal pain among older patients in the ED. Dr. Friedman will use the training funded by
this Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award to examine variation in ED abdominal
pain testing, management, disposition, and outcomes overall and among patients with frailty, cognitive
impairment, among disadvantaged populations, and in periods when resources do not meet demand.
Research Plan: These Aims will be carried out by using primary data collected through the proposed ED
Geriatric Abdominal Pain (ED-GAP) cohort with additional variables from the Penn Electronic Health Record
(EHR). This data will capture both management and outcomes for admitted patients and contains
measurements of essential factors associated with aging. Retrospective EHR data of abdominal pain visits to 6
EDs over 8 years will also be used. Multivariate regression will test the hypotheses above.
Environment: Senior researchers with an established track record of mentoring scholars from their early
career to independent and impactful work are committed to Dr. Friedman's success. This team is embedded
within a university environment with a track record of collaborative, pathbreaking scholarship in health
economics, health services research, emergency medicine, and gerontology."
10735798,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Melanoma is more prevalent in men than women, suggesting sex hormones may influence this disease. Clinical
studies correlate decreased estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) expression with disease progression. However, the
mechanisms by which the receptor protects against melanoma formation and progression remain unknown.
Our preliminary data show that ERβ loss accelerates tumor formation in a murine melanoma model thereby
confirming the tumor suppressor activity implicated in the clinical data. The melanocyte ERβ cistrome overlaps
with key melanocyte transcription factors that act as master regulators of differentiation, proliferation, and
migration. Estrogen-regulated genes in melanocytes are associated with differentiation and migration pathways
supporting a co-regulatory link between ERβ and these master regulators.
In addition to the tumor suppressor function of ERβ in melanocytes, ERβ has a melanocyte-nonautonomous
function that results in reduced immune infiltrates within the tumor. Furthermore, an ERβ-specific agonist can
activate T cells, reduce immune checkpoint inhibitor expression, and increase T cell activation.
These data lead to the overarching hypothesis that ERβ activity represses melanoma initiation and
progression by modulating melanocyte-intrinsic master regulator activity and enhancing immune
responses to the tumor. In this proposal, the hypothesis will be tested by 1) Defining the melanocyte-intrinsic
ERβ activities that repress melanoma onset and progression; 2) Determining the influence of ERβ-regulated
immune activities on melanoma initiation and therapeutic response."
10735800,"Background: Implementing timely and consistent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) screening among
cirrhosis patients improves early tumor detection, treatment options, and overall survival. Guideline-
concordant HCC screening rates are suboptimal, particularly among ethnic minorities and non-English
speaking immigrant populations. The underlying mechanistic drivers of these disparities in HCC screening
among ethnic minorities and underserved populations is not clear, and no studies have comprehensively
evaluated the mediating roles of patient, provider, and system level factors in contributing to these disparities.
Goals: To understand mechanisms of disparities in HCC screening among ethnic minority and underserved
populations and how COVID-19 pandemic-related disruptions in healthcare delivery have exacerbated these
disparities, we propose three specific aims: 1) Examine racial and ethnic disparities in HCC screening among
cirrhosis patients in the pre-COVID-19, COVID-19, and post-COVID-19 recovery periods; 2) Identify provider-
specific factors (e.g. knowledge, attitudes, practice patterns, perceived barriers, biases and stereotypes towards
ethnic minorities, pandemic-related practice adaptations) contributing to HCC screening disparities; and 3)
Conduct multi-level mediational analyses to identify patient, provider, and system level factors that contribute
to ethnic disparities in HCC screening, affecting tumor stage at diagnosis, receipt of treatment, and survival.
Methods: Contemporaneous longitudinal real-world observational data on 10,500 cirrhosis patients linked to
provider survey data from 300 primary care and gastroenterology across five safety net health systems
representing broad geographic and ethnic diversity will be used. Patient-level and system-level factors will be
retrospectively extracted from electronic health records at each site, and provider-level factors will be assessed
using a previously validated survey-based approach. Innovative multi-level mediation analytic methods that
incorporate patient, provider, and system level factors will be utilized to evaluate mechanisms of disparities in
HCC screening among ethnic minorities and non-English speaking immigrants. To mitigate confounding found
in observational analyses, innovative casual inference techniques will be applied.
Significance: Despite the high burden of HCC among ethnic minorities and non-English speaking
immigrants and the observed lower rates of HCC screening among these populations, it remains unclear what
the drivers of these disparities are. To our knowledge, no studies exist that comprehensively evaluate the
complex interplay between patient, provider, and system level factors that mediate ethnic disparities in receipt
of HCC screening as is proposed by our novel study. Lessons learned from the synergy of our study aims will
identify potentially modifiable factors that can be used to design a future multi-level prospective interventional
clinical trial to improve HCC screening and HCC outcomes in cirrhosis patients, particularly among ethnic
minorities and underserved safety-net populations."
10741833,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] is one of the most common environmental carcinogens causing lung cancer,
however, the mechanism of Cr(VI) carcinogenesis remains elusive. The N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification is
the most prevalent internal modification in eukaryotic messenger RNAs (mRNAs), which is dynamically regulated
by three groups of proteins known as writers, erasers and readers. Recent advances in demonstrating the vital
roles of RNA m6A modifications in regulating gene expression and a variety of biological processes represents a
breakthrough in understanding RNA biology and functions. Moreover, accumulating evidence has shown that up-
regulation of m6A modifications plays critical roles in cancer progression and cancer therapy resistances. However,
it remains largely un-explored whether the m6A modification dysregulation plays a role in the carcinogenic process
especially in environmental carcinogenesis. The goal of this study is to investigate the mechanism of Cr(VI)
carcinogenesis by studying RNA m6A modification dysregulations, focusing on the role and mechanism of chronic
Cr(VI) exposure-caused m6A writer methyltransferase like 3 (METTL3) up-regulation. Our preliminary studies found:
(i) Chronic Cr(VI) exposure up-regulates METTL3 expression, which contributes causally to Cr(VI)-induced cell
transformation, CSC-like property and tumorigenesis. (ii) METTL3 up-regulation is also similarly detected in chronic
Cr(VI) exposure-caused human and mouse lung tumor tissues. (iii) The Jak2-Stat3 pathway is activated. (iv) Jak2
and SOCS3 mRNA levels are increased and decreased in Cr(VI)-transformed cells, respectively. Stably knocking
down METTL3 significantly decreases Jak2 but increases SOCS3 mRNA levels. (v) Inhibition of the Jak2-Stat3
oncogenic pathway in Cr(VI)-transformed cells significantly reduces their CSC-like property. (vi) The repressive
histone 2A (H2A) lysine 119 (K119) monoubiquitination (H2AK119ub1) levels and H2AK119ub1 enrichment at
METTL3 promoter region are greatly reduced in Cr(VI)-transformed cells. (vii) The expression level of a H2A
deubiquitinase USP28 is up-regulated in Cr(VI)-transformed cells. Knockdown of USP28 increases H2AK119ub1
levels but reduces METTL3 protein levels. Based on literature review and our novel preliminary data, our central
hypothesis is: “METTL3 up-regulation increases Jak2 and SOCS3 mRNA m6A modifications to up-regulate Jak2
but down-regulate SOCS3 expressions, which activates the oncogenic Jak2-Stat3 pathway promoting Cr(VI)
carcinogenesis”. Three aims are proposed: Aim 1 will determine the mechanism of how chronic Cr(VI) exposure up-
regulates METTL3 expression focusing on the role of USP28-mediated down-regulation of histone 2A
monoubiquitination. Aim 2 will demonstrate that METTL3 up-regulation increases Jak2 and SCOS3 mRNA m6A
modifications to activate the Jak2-Stat3 pathway promoting Cr(VI)-exposure-induced CSC-like property and
tumorigenesis. Aim 3 will demonstrate that METTL3 lung-specific deletion using a METTL3 conditional knockout
mouse model impairs Cr(VI) lung tumorigenesis in mice."

Heart failure (HF) is a growing pandemic; in the U.S., the number of those diagnosed with HF is expected to
rise to 8 million with annual costs at $69 billion by 2030. Despite effective interventions to reduce HF morbidity
and mortality, vulnerable populations with HF suffer disproportionately from hospitalization and mortality
especially in the southern U.S. states. Self-management (SM) behavioral interventions to improve HF
outcomes are therefore imperative. Remote interventions to promote SM behaviors present an important
strategy to address the widening geographical and racial health disparities in HF outcomes. One promising
approach is the use of sensor-controlled digital games (SCDGs), which offer affordable, portable, scalable tools
to facilitate engagement in HF SM behaviors that show the poorest adherence (weight monitoring and physical
activity) while being enjoyable and easy to use. The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a
SCDG intervention that integrates HF participants’ behavioral data from weight scale and activity tracker
sensors to activate game progress, rewards, and feedback. For Aim 1, we will refine an SCDG that we have
already developed for mobile smartphones to be playable for longer durations for sustained behavior
adherence to weight-monitoring and physical activity. For Aim 2, using a randomized controlled clinical trial, we
will compare the SCDG intervention versus a sensor-only intervention for the primary outcome of rate of

behavior engagement, HF SM knowledge, self-efficacy, HF functional status, hospitalization, and quality of life
at baseline and at 6, 12, and 24 weeks. For our sample, we will recruit adults aged 45 years or older from 7
southern U.S. states and hospitalized with HF within the past 6 months. We will randomize 200 participants to
either the SCDG intervention group, in which participants will receive sensors that track weight monitoring and
activity and will play the SCDG on a mobile smartphone, or a control group that will receive sensors, an app
that tracks activity and weight monitoring, and standardized written HF educational materials. For Aim 3, we
will conduct a mixed-methods assessment to discern facilitators and barriers impacting participants’
engagement with the sensor-based interventions for HF SM behavior adherence. For Aim 4, based on daily HF
SM weight-monitoring and physical activity behavior data and ecological momentary assessments of
symptoms, mood, satisfaction, and cognitive status, we will conduct digital phenotyping of HF SM weight-
monitoring and physical activity behaviors. This project will generate insight and guidance for scalable and
easy-to-use digital gaming solutions to motivate persistent adherence to HF SM behaviors and improve health
outcomes among individuals with HF."

 Adverse social determinants of health (SDoH) disproportionately impact low-income and communities
of color. The multisectoral alignment of expertise and resources can effectively target these adverse SDoH
needs through innovation and diverse perspectives; and one such example is that of medical legal
partnerships (MLPs) wherein healthcare institutions work with legal entities to address adverse social needs
through legal remediation. These adverse social needs are thereby referred to as health harming legal needs
(HHLNs) as they depend on legal support for resolution. While there has been great interest in MLP
implementation, research on its efficacy and factors that predict implementation success is lacking in clinical
settings. Furthermore, none of these existing experimental studies were conducted in the southern region of
the U.S, thus omitting geographic and cultural contexts to MLP implementation. Given this limited availability of
research in support of effectiveness, we propose a systems-level approach to explore the impact of a patient-
informed MLP intervention that resolves HHLNs in pediatric families enrolled across UT Physicians
multispecialty clinics. This approach integrates the community voice (patient) perspective to identify lived
experiences (themes) within the clinic setting that may impede the screening and care coordination process.
As such, we will use key informant interviews to qualitatively explore and identify themes that influence
patients' experiences with
on
feedback
screening and resource access for adverse social needs, with particular emphasis
factors that may impact utilization of an MLP program to resolve these needs (Aim 1). We will then leverage
from Aim 1 tobuild an evaluation framework and protocol for assessing the reach, effectiveness,
adoption, implementation, and maintenance of a real world MLP intervention (Aim 2a). This evaluation
framework will be subsequently utilized in our quasi-experimental study to assess MLP effectiveness and
factors that impact implementation in pediatric families who visit UT Physicians multispecialty clinics (Aim 2b).
Successful project completion will inform MLP implementation across clinics, strategies to better target at-risk
populations, and the submission of an R01 application where we can assess the efficacy of an MLP
intervention and further examine MLP expansion and implementation across clinics in the Greater Houston
area.
 To date, my my research has examined the impact of demographic, social, and contextual factors on
adverse behavioral and health-related outcomes among low-income and minority groups. The mentorship of
Drs. Sharma, Murphy, Liaw, and Huber supported by this K01 mechanism will ensure that I continue to acquire
knowledge and advanced training in relevant qualitative and quantitative methodologies, systems-level
interventions, and community based participatory research strategies for informing research activities."

During the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), skeletal muscle mass and function precipitously declines
in comparison to those who are cognitively intact, potentially due to poor mitochondrial health in skeletal muscle.
Thus, bioenergetics of peripheral tissues, and skeletal muscle in particular, may have an underappreciated role
in AD etiology. Exercise is an effective means to promote mitochondrial, as well as, skeletal muscle health.
However, whether regular exercise has therapeutic potential for delaying or preventing AD is an outstanding
question. We present evidence of impaired skeletal muscle AMPK-signaling response to exercise in 5xFAD mice,
a model of AD. We show in 5xFAD mice that muscle dysfunction is present at a young age before observable
cognitive decline and that muscle loss and impaired mitochondrial health manifest along by an age associated
with cognitive decline. We present evidence that mitochondrial respiration does not improve following 12 weeks
exercise training in 22-week-old 5xFAD mice compared to WT littermates. In sum, bioenergetic dysfunction in
muscle may underlie a maladaptive response to exercise prior to overt manifestation of AD-related pathology.
There is a critical need therefore to define the adaptive mechanisms in muscle in relation to neurophysiological
changes over the continuum of AD pathology to identify novel therapeutic targets. Our central hypothesis is that
impaired bioenergetics precedes manifestation of overt AD neuropathology resulting in maladaptation in muscle
to exercise training. To test our hypothesis, we propose two aims: Aim 1) Determine the adaptive response of
muscle mitochondria to endurance exercise training in AD mice before development of AD. We will assess
mitochondrial respiration and reactive oxygen species (ROS production in intact muscle fibers and as well as
synthesis (i.e. biogenesis) and breakdown (via D2O labeling - GC/MS) of muscle mitochondria in 22-week-old
5xFAD and APP/PS1 male and female mice following 12 weeks voluntary wheel running (exercise training) (1a),
determine pre- and post-exercise training muscle function in vivo (Aurora), neuromuscular junction integrity
(histochemistry) and mitochondrial quality (confocal microscopy) in novel MitoTimer/5xFAD transgenic mice (1b),
assess central (hippocampus) and peripheral (plasma NfL) neuropathology (1c), and perform untargeted
metabolomics of muscle and hippocampus following exercise training (1d). Aim 2) Determine the tissue-specific
and functional roles for AMPK⍺1 in AD etiology in 5xFAD mice. We will assess mitochondrial function,
proteostasis, development of neuropathology, and metabolomics in both muscle and hippocampus at 3, 6, and
9 months of age in muscle- and motor neuron-specific AMPK⍺1 knock-out mice, as well as novel gain- and loss-
of-function AMPK⍺1(T172A) knock-in mice. Our findings will elucidate the maladaptive response of skeletal
muscle mitochondria to exercise training in context with AD neuropathology and the integrated isoform-specific
functional role of AMPK⍺ in AD etiology. These studies will provide mechanistic to the integrated pathology along
the continuum of AD pathology between skeletal muscle and brain and the role of exercise as a therapeutic."

The free text notes in electronic health records (EHRs) contain details vital to cancer research that often are
found nowhere else in the EHR. Such details include social and behavioral determinants of health, family
histories, cancer staging, tumor markers, disease progression, response to treatment, overall outcomes, and
more. Utilizing the free text (also called unstructured data) can be challenging, and researchers need tools to
help them leverage those data in a meaningful way. The electronic medical record search engine (EMERSE)
has been in operation, and under continuous development, for 17 years and was designed to help cancer
researchers meaningfully use unstructured EHR data. EMERSE started as simple information retrieval system
but has since gained many features for supporting clinical research. It is distinguished from other text-processing
research tools, in part, by its ease of use and other enterprise software features such as maintaining audit logs
and providing administrator functions. With the support of an ITCR grant that is nearing completion, EMERSE
has grown from a tool used at only one site (University of Michigan) to one that is running, or being implemented,
at multiple cancer centers and other academic research institutions across the country. EMERSE also now
supports the capability of searching across a network of instances to securely obtain obfuscated patient counts
at other sites, which can be valuable for identifying rare cancer cohorts. The innovations in this proposal include:
(1) Building new functionality into EMERSE to expand its research capabilities such as timeline data
visualizations, self-service data extraction workflows from templated notes, support for optical character
recognition (OCR), and integration with other ITCR tools such as DeepPhe through an application programming
interface (API); (2) Incorporating natural language processing (NLP) into EMERSE including named entity
recognition (mapped to the Unified Medical Language System, UMLS), negation (e.g., “patient denies pain”),
uncertainty (e.g., “possibility of recurrence”), and experiencer (e.g, “breast cancer in her mother”); (3) Expanding
the EMERSE network in breadth, capability, security, and trust by partnering with external sites to collectively
develop a consensus and a viable approach for broadly enabling this novel network technology; and (4)
Continuing to evaluate EMERSE with a focus on networking, security, and scientific outcomes by conducting
additional user-centered studies to develop a deeper understanding of how EMERSE is being, or could be, used
with a goal of continuous improvement. The EMERSE team routinely receives feedback from users and site
administrators and the proposed work is highly responsive to our growing user base and will enable research
that is currently impractical, if not impossible, for many researchers to accomplish. The enhancements and
knowledge gained from this effort will make EMERSE even more powerful and capable of supporting a wide
range of clinical and translational cancer research for a growing user base across the nation."

INTRODUCTION: RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 represent an ongoing public health threat. To replicate
properly, RNA viruses must perform multiple functions in the same cytoplasm (i.e., genome replication,
circularization, generation of sub-genomic RNA, packaging etc.) and for betacoronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2
the structural nucleocapsid protein (N) is required for all of these processes. How are RNA viruses able to
perform multiple functions in the same cytoplasm with their limited proteome (for example ~24 proteins for
SARS-CoV-2)? I hypothesize that one way RNA viruses achieve biochemical complexity is by condensation of
RNA and protein components. Biochemical complexity can emerge by virtue of the co-condensing RNA as
different viral RNA sequences confer different condensate properties. In this way, a single protein, N, can
perform multiple functions in the same cytoplasm. I uncovered the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 N
recognizes RNA to undergo condensation. Now, I am interested in understanding how the interaction of N with
viral RNA controls condensation and impacts important viral functions. RESEARCH: In my K99/R00 research;
(Aim 1) I will unbiasedly probe RNA-RNA interactions to understand how RNA is arranged and how
interactions are modulated by condensation for genome circularization. (Aim 2) I will develop BSL2 assays to
determine which viral processes require N condensation. (Aim 3) I will design synthetic RNA-binding proteins
and small molecules to disrupt N condensation. TRAINING: I will complete my training period in Dr. Amy
Gladfelter’s lab. During the training period, I will further develop my skills in RNA structure probing SHAPE
(RNA structure), RNP-map (RNA/protein crosslinking), and SHAPE-Jump (RNA-RNA crosslinking) in
collaboration with Weeks lab. I will learn how to design synthetic IDPs for the creation of bespoke RNA-binding
proteins (Chilkoti). I will screen an existing small molecule library to identify inhibitors of N condensation
(Fiorti). I will learn how to culture and genetically manipulate a BSL2 model betacoronavirus, MHV (Sheahan
and Cameron). ENVIRONMENT: Dr. Amy Gladfelter is one of the world’s leading experts on the role of RNA in
condensation. Additionally, UNC has some of the world’s leading experts in coronavirus biology including labs
with BSL3 facilities offering the possibility to test newly developed N condensation inhibitors with live virus. I
plan to further my growth through participation in RNA and condensation conferences, and attendance of
courses in virology. I also plan on using my K99/R00 to ease my transition into running my own lab as an
independent investigator. I am particularly interested in joining a university with strong biochemistry, molecular
biology, virology, and biomedical engineering departments who are looking for an RNA structure enthusiast to
join their ranks! IMPACT ON PUBLIC HEALTH: This work will advance our understanding of how
betacoronavirus N recognize viral RNA sequences and may one day lead to novel therapeutics."

Cardiovascular disease causes 34% of all deaths in the United States and 17.6 million
Americans suffer from coronary heart disease (CHD). Of these, 8.5 million experience
myocardial infarction. Although we have made significant progress in understanding the
mechanisms of reperfusion injury of heart, we are yet to find an effective intervention to
alleviate I/R injury. Nitric oxide (NO) plays a major role in relaxation of coronary
microcirculation that is important to transport oxygen and nutrients to myocardial tissue. It
has been demonstrated that nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), the enzyme that generates NO
in the vascular endothelium is altered in I/R and produces deleterious superoxide anion
radical, which not only depletes NO by reacting with it, but also produces more harmful
reactive nitrogen species. Intriguingly, in our preliminary studies we found that eNOS is
glutathionylated and progressively lost in the myocardial tissue following I/R. We
hypothesize that eNOS undergoes S-glutathionylation during I/R that induces its
chaperone mediated autophagy, resulting in irreversible loss of NO production that affects
coronary microcirculation and perfusion resulting in myocardial infarction (MI) in I/R. In
Aim 1 we will investigate the mechanism of loss of vascular eNOS due to S-
glutathionylation. In Aim 2, we will investigate the specific type of autophagy involved in
eNOS disappearance; and in Aim 3 we will elucidate the eNOS autophagy and evaluate
whether deglutathionylation by thioredoxin would ameliorate reperfusion injury, using a
variety of transgenic and knockout mice models. Our proposed research will provide a
clear understanding of the role of coronary vascular mechanism of loss of eNOS in I/R.
The results of this study may provide significant insight into clinical management of
myocardial infarction and develop new intervention for treatment of reperfusion injury."

A diverse U.S. biomedical research workforce is necessary for improving health through innovative basic,
clinical, and translational research. Despite decades of efforts to increase representation of underrepresented
racial and ethnic groups in science, representation remains unacceptably low in academia. IRACDA at OHSU
is a proposed mentored postdoctoral career development training program that will partner with Pacific
University to provide teaching training and opportunities for a diverse group of IRACDA scholars from
experienced and invested teaching mentors. The main objective of IRACDA at OHSU is to recruit and train a
diverse pool of postdoctoral scholars in safe and inclusive environments that will ensure their successful
transition to independent academic research and teaching careers. Scholars will be trained in conducting
rigorous and reproducible research, as well as scientific teaching principles and evidence-based pedagogy
practices. A cohort of 3 scholars will be appointed each year, which will provide a good balance between
creating a community of fellows and the program's ability to provide personalized training and mentoring.
Scholars will be selected based on academic achievement and potential, as well as on the strength of the
potential mentor-mentee match. To facilitate a positive experience, all OHSU IRACDA research mentors are
required to complete training in the OHSU Mentoring Academy. Moreover, during scholar onboarding, mentors
will work closely with scholars to generate a detailed Individual Development Plan (IDP) that will incorporate a
research plan with focus on rigor and reproducibility, as well as a personalized career development plan. The
teaching mentors at Pacific University have a record of excellence in evidence-based approaches to teaching
in a STEM field. The IRACDA at OHSU training plan has concurrent paths in each year of the fellowship for
mentored research, career development, and teaching training. Year 1 is focused on setting the scholars up for
success during their training, with foundational programming such as the IDP, formal training in responsible
training of research, monthly program seminars, and training in teaching pedagogy and tools. Year 2 centers
training as an iterative process involving practice and feedback for presenting research, grant writing,
mentoring, and teaching. Activities in year 3 are designed to provide the scholars with opportunities to reflect
on their practices, embrace growth opportunities, and prepare for the transition to independent positions by
applying for independent funding. Scholars will explore networking opportunities at OHSU, Pacific University,
and at National/International Scientific Conferences at least once per year, and receive manuscript and grant
writing training, as well as assistance preparing application materials for faculty positions. IRACDA at OHSU
will benefit both post-doctoral fellows, as well as the partner institution, by providing new and improved science
curriculum, authentic research experiences and critical mentoring for underrepresented students to enhance
academic advancement and train the next generation of scientists."
10932893,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) or systemically administered radionuclide therapy are attractive approaches
that can perturb the tumor microenvironment (TME) so that targeted immunotherapy can convert a largely
immunoresistant into an immunosusceptible tumor. Although this approach has been clinically explored using
high or low or high plus low dose IGRT plus untargeted checkpoint immunotherapy, further improvements are
warranted and require testing in appropriate clinical studies and preclinical models. In this application we
propose three aims to test our hypothesis that IGRT and or targeted alpha therapy (TAT) followed immediately
by immunocytokine (ICK), a form of targeted immunotherapy, will lead to increased tumor infiltration of IFN+
CD8s (Teff) and decreased Foxp3+ CD4s (Treg). This hypothesis is supported by two studies targeting CEA,
a major marker of solid tumor malignancies (eg. colon and breast), in CEA transgenic mice that are
immunocompetent, express CEA in normal tissues, and are tolerant to CEA. We now propose to test this
hypothesis in two clinical trials, aims 1 (IGRT + ICK) and 2 (TAT), and perform immunocorrelate studies for
Teff and Treg cells, among others, on pre- and post-therapy biopsies. Aim 2 is a TAT only study as a prelude
to a third clinical trial combining TAT plus ICK, that will be initiated at the end of the project period. In aim 3, we
will refine our animal studies to determine TME changes immediately after sequential therapy for both IGRT
plus ICK or TAT plus ICK, by a combination of PET imaging for CEA, CD8s and stromal cells by fibroblast
activated protein (FAPI), along with flow and IHC analysis of tumors, LNs and spleen. We expect the results of
aims 1 and 2 to further guide aim 3, and the results of aim 3 to guide future trials that incorporate IGRT and/or
TAT plus ICK in CEA positive malignancies."

Children and young adults with metastatic Ewing sarcoma driven by oncogenic fusion transcription factor EWS-
FLI1 continue to have poor outcomes. Immunotherapies using T cells, NK cells, cancer vaccines, and
monoclonal antibodies are being considered for Ewing sarcoma, especially for recurrent patients. The
identification of human tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) recognized by the immune system is crucial for
immunotherapy. Through integration of Ewing sarcoma cell line gene expression, ChIP-seq, and normal and
cancer tissue gene expression from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), and the TCGA project, we have
identified LIPI as a highly specific tumor antigen and a potential oncogene that relies on the transcriptional activity
of EWS-FLI1 in Ewing sarcoma. LIPI (Lipase member I (EC:3.1.1.-) is an evolutionarily conserved protein
predicted to poses a transmembrane domain and extracellular lipid hydrolase domain. The biological function of
LIPI is not known but the enzymatic activity of LIPI is expected to produce lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) that
potently affects several biological functions including proliferation, cell survival, and metastasis of tumor cells.
We hypothesize that the LIPI is a unique biomarker and an oncogene that is expressed exclusively in Ewing
sarcoma and is a potential target for cell based therapy. To our knowledge, this proposal represents the first
study evaluating the role of LIPI in cellular physiology and in particular Ewing sarcoma progression and
metastasis. The two specific aims of the projects are:
Specific Aim 1: To elucidate the regulation and role of cell surface LIPI in Ewing sarcoma
Specific Aim 2: To investigate the role of LIPI in Ewing sarcoma growth/metastasis.
Following the successful completion of the proposed aims in this application, we will have evaluated the potential
of LIPI as a Ewing sarcoma specific surface oncoprotein, and will have a long-term impact by establishing the
strong foundation for the development of LIPI-directed immunotherapeutics against Ewing sarcoma."

 Morbidity and mortality related to opioid use continue to rise, with fentanyl now the most
common opioid involved in overdose death. Despite three FDA approved medications for opioid
use disorder (MOUD)—methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone--as many as 3 out of 4
people with OUD are not on any of these lifesaving medications, which speaks to failures in
implementation. The penetration of fentanyl into the opioid supply has made strategies for
initiation of buprenorphine even more complex. Growing literature describes increased
precipitated withdrawal at the time of buprenorphine initiation, thought to be secondary to the
lipophilic nature of fentanyl. There is an urgent need to better understand how we can
successfully engage more people in treatment that we know decreases morbidity and mortality
related to OUD. The work proposed in this K23 application will investigate the initiation of
buprenorphine in the setting of fentanyl use from both the patient and provider perspectives. We
will utilize novel methods to develop a buprenorphine initiation toolkit and then will pilot the
implementation of this new tool. The specific aims of the research are to: 1. Use qualitative
methods to explore the experience of both patients and providers initiating buprenorphine for
OUD in the setting of fentanyl use. 2a. Conduct a modified Delphi process to investigate expert
consensus regarding buprenorphine initiation in the setting of fentanyl. 2b. Work with a
multidisciplinary group to develop a buprenorphine initiation toolkit, and 3: Conduct a pilot study
to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility and effectiveness of the buprenorphine initiation toolkit.
Along with the multipronged training plan, this research will support my overarching goal of
becoming an independent physician researcher focused on improving outcomes for people with
substance use disorders through innovative implementation approaches."
10724241,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a slowly progressing disease involving genetic abnormalities
and environmental insults. It is the leading cause of blindness for older Americans; and as the population
ages, the prevalence of AMD continues to grow. Since smoking increases AMD risk and there is a higher
incidence of smoking in veterans, disproportionally more veterans will be affected. Treatments are available
for choroidal neovascularization (CNV); but those come with risks and only target a subpopulation of AMD
patients. No treatment is available for early AMD and geographic atrophy (GA; >85% of all cases), making it
paramount to develop a treatment for early disease intervention. While mechanistic studies have shown that
inflammation and smoking are fundamental components of AMD, genetic studies have demonstrated that
polymorphisms in complement proteins each increase the risk for developing AMD. One of the most detri-
mental mutation occurs in factor H (fH) an essential inhibitor in the complement alternative pathway (AP),
suggesting that inadequate control of complement-driven inflammation is a major AMD risk factor. Despite
the many encouraging data in animal models and early phase clinical trials, complement therapeutics in GA
to date have failed to reach clinical endpoints in phase 2/3 trials. Approaches included blocking complement
factor C5 (activator in the terminal pathway) or factor D (fD; AP activator). What these strategies had in
common was that most of the drug was wasted on non-pathophysiologically important target molecules; i.e.,
most complement components in fluids or tissue are not engaged in complement activation and hence to
reduce complement activation for example at the RPE, Bruch’s membrane (BrM) or choriocapillaris (CC),
the majority of a given complement component has to be permanently inhibited to achieve the desired ef-
fect. In addition, complement components are made in the eye and systemically, and many complement
components can penetrate BrM; hence an almost unlimited reservoir of complement proteins exists that
needs to be controlled. Finally, it is still unclear what is the tissue of complement activation in dry AMD; reti-
na, RPE, BrM or CC. Given these complications, we propose to build on our preliminary data utilizing an
“addressable” inhibitor that target to sites of complement activation regardless of the location (CR2-fH) de-
livered via gene therapy. We will determine the site of delivery, intravitreal, subretinal or suprachoroidal, re-
quired for optimal protection, the time window of delivery, and confirm efficacy in animal models of AMD.
Specifically, vectors are designed to optimally target cells in the inner retina, RPE and choroid and tested
for efficacy in two validated mouse models (choroidal neovascularization and smoke-induced ocular pathol-
ogy). The optimal vectors will be confirmed in additional mouse and non-human primate models. Overall,
this work is designed to move anti-complement therapy towards clinical application, with the long-term goal
of developing a treatment to reduce the number of AMD cases and improve veteran care and quality of life."
10724242,"Sarcopenia, a progressive loss of muscle mass and strength associated with aging, is present in 25% of older
individuals. Obesity is also very common in this age group and both conditions lead to increased disability,
morbidity and mortality. Their combination is termed sarcopenic obesity and is associated with the highest
risks of disability, mortality and increased healthcare costs. Despite its relevance, treatments for
sarcopenic obesity are not available and the molecular mechanisms leading to this condition
are incompletely understood. Ghrelin, the endogenous ligand for the GHSR-1a receptor, is an
orexigenic hormone that regulates muscle and fat mass. We recently showed that ghrelin deletion is
sufficient to prevent sarcopenic obesity in older mice. It attenuates the decrease in pAMPK and
increases the number of type IIa (oxidative) muscle fibers, while also preventing obesity. Also, we have recently
shown that ghrelin exerts its effects in muscle and in adipose tissue, at least in part, independently of the
GHSR-1a. However, the mechanisms mediating these effects are incompletely understood.
The overall goals of this proposal are to characterize the mechanisms mediating the role of ghrelin
and its receptor (GHSR-1a) in sarcopenic obesity, and to evaluate the potential for GHSR-1a
antagonism as a therapeutic approach in this setting. We hypothesize that in a rodent model of age-
related sarcopenic obesity: 1) Ghrelin induces skeletal muscle dysfunction by: a) Causing mitochondrial
dysfunction and fiber type distribution changes, and b) Modulating fatty acid metabolism and ectopic lipid
deposition; 2) Ghrelin induces fat accumulation by modulating food intake, thermogenesis, and fatty acid
metabolism in adipose tissue, and 3) GHSR-1a antagonism/deletion will partially prevent sarcopenic obesity
by upregulating AMPK-dependent pathways that regulate fiber type distribution in muscle and mitochondrial
function and lipid metabolism in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. The specific aims are:
1) Characterize the mechanisms mediating the effects of ghrelin in muscle in sarcopenic
obesity. Young (8-month old), middle age (18-month old) and old (28-month old) adult ghrelin WT&KO mice
will be evaluated for body composition, food intake, locomotor activity and muscle performance. Muscle mass,
fiber type and markers of AMPK activation, mitochondrial function, fatty acid metabolism, and lipid storage
will be evaluated in muscles. The effect of chronic ghrelin administration, and pair-feeding will also be tested.
2) Determine the mechanisms mediating the effects of ghrelin on adiposity and adipocyte
function in sarcopenic obesity. Young, middle age and old adult ghrelin WT and KO mice will be evaluated
for energy expenditure, body composition, food intake and locomotor activity. Molecular mediators of
thermogenesis, mitochondrial function, AMPK activation and lipid metabolism will be probed in white and
brown fat pads. The effect of chronic ghrelin administration, and pair-feeding will also be tested.
3) Establish the extent to which GHSR-1a mediate the effects of ghrelin. Young, middle age and old
adult GHSR-1a WT and KO mice will be evaluated for body composition, food intake, locomotor activity,
muscle performance and energy expenditure. Fiber typing and molecular markers in muscle and fat will be
studied as indicated in aims 1 and 2 above. The effect of chronic ghrelin administration in GHSR-1a WT and
KO, and pharmacological inhibition of GHSR-1a (using the GHSR-1a antagonist HM04) in ghrelin WT and KO
also will be tested. To determine the role of AMPK in this setting, the effects of HM04 will also be tested in WT
and AMPKα2i transgenic mice that express the inactive form AMPKα in skeletal muscle.
Characterizing the mechanisms mediating the effects of ghrelin and GHSR-1a is novel and relevant because
ghrelin, GHSR-1a agonists and antagonists are in clinical development. A better understanding of their
mechanisms of action will allow us to develop novel therapies for sarcopenic obesity."

While much research has been dedicated to understanding the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD),
the neural dynamics underlying the manifestation of motor signs remain unclear. Studies over the past two
decades have shown a correlation between the amplitude and incidence of beta band oscillations in the
subthalamic nucleus (STN) and changes in bradykinesia and rigidity mediated by levodopa or deep brain
stimulation (DBS) therapies. Yet, no study has conclusively or deductively demonstrated a causal link. A
limitation to establishing causality is the lack of available neuromodulation tools capable of predictably and
precisely controlling neural oscillatory activity in the human brain in real-time without introducing confounding
factors. Establishing these tools and clarifying whether the relationship of beta band oscillations with PD motor
signs is causal or epiphenomenon are critical steps to better understand PD pathophysiology and advance
personalized DBS technology in PD and other conditions. This project aims to address these technology and
knowledge gaps by leveraging feedback control engineering and patient-specific computational modeling tools.
We will employ a new neural control approach developed in our group (evoked interference closed-loop DBS,
eiDBS) to characterize the degree by which controlled suppression or amplification of beta oscillations in the
STN influences bradykinesia and rigidity in PD (Specific Aim 1, SA1). In SA2, we will employ levodopa medication
to characterize how changes in bradykinesia and rigidity relate to variations in the amplitude, natural frequency,
and resonance of neural responses in the STN and primary motor cortex (MC) evoked by STN stimulation. The
results from SA2 will help us gain a greater understanding of intrinsic circuit dynamics associated with PD and
identify strategies to optimize closed-loop DBS algorithms (e.g., eiDBS) in the face of concurrent levodopa
therapy, a necessary step to bring this technology to clinical trials. Combining electrophysiological data with high-
resolution (7T) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and computational modeling, we will identify which specific
neuronal pathways connected with the STN need to be activated to evoke frequency-specific neural responses
in the STN and MC (SA3). The data from SA3 will shed light on which sub-circuits are involved in the generation
of stimulation-evoked and spontaneous beta oscillations in PD, and inform how we can use directional DBS
leads to shape electric fields in the STN to selectively modulate the STN or MC via eiDBS. We will address the
three aims of this project with 25 PD patients implanted with DBS leads in the STN, whose DBS lead extensions
will be externalized and connected to our recording and closed-loop stimulation infrastructure. This project is
well aligned with the NINDS Parkinson’s Disease 2014 Research Recommendations, as we “use a combination
of sensor technologies and imaging to develop a more precise understanding of the neural circuit dynamics in
PD to enable the development of next-generation therapeutic devices.”"
10915732,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Heavy alcohol use is prevalent in the United States and results in significant physical and psychological
burden. One in 10 adults in the United States reports binge drinking on a weekly basis, and few are willing to
seek mental health treatment. Thus, additional strategies are needed to engage and treat individuals at risk for
alcohol-related harm. Half of those who screen positive for hazardous drinking report clinically significant
symptoms of insomnia. Insomnia tends to be less stigmatized than other mental health disorders, and it is one
condition for which we have highly efficacious treatment. Thus, one potential strategy to engage individuals in
mental health treatment and reduce the burden of alcohol use in the United States is to target insomnia. The
proposed five-year R01 aims (1) to investigate daily associations between sleep and alcohol use, (2) to
examine change in insomnia as a mediator of CBT-I effects on alcohol use outcomes and sex as a moderator
of those effects, (3) to identify mechanisms linking change in insomnia to alcohol use outcomes, and (4) to
evaluate CBT-I effects on cardiovascular outcomes. Heavy-drinking adults with insomnia will be randomly
assigned to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I, n=112) or waitlist control (WLC, n=112).
Outcomes will be assessed mid-treatment (after 3 sessions), at the end of the active intervention period (post-
treatment), and at 1, 3, and 6 month follow-ups. Primary outcomes include insomnia severity, drinking quantity,
and alcohol-related consequences. Data will be analyzed using multilevel models. The results of the proposed
research will inform research and clinical practice by determining the extent to which sleep operates as a
mechanism of alcohol behavior change. Its innovation lies in evaluation of insomnia not only as a gateway to
mental health treatment, but also as a mechanism of improvement in alcohol-related consequences. This is
consistent with NIAAA’s strategic plan to evaluate interventions that target sleep."

initiation, establishment, and sustenance, of these malignancies. B-cell malignancies are initiated >5-fold more
frequently in patients suffering from refractory autoimmune B-lymphoproliferative disorders such as systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE), making SLE a relevant disease model to study initiation of B-cell neoplasms. The
hormone prolactin (PRL) is known to exacerbate the symptoms of SLE, enhance survival of lymphoid cells, and
promote the expression of the protooncogenes MYC and BCL2 in these cells. Whether PRL contributes to
evolution of B-cell malignancies was unknown. PRL receptors (PRLRs) are type I cytokine receptors that
have long (LF), intermediate (IF, only in humans) and short (SF) isoforms generated by alternative splicing.
Increased expression of the LF/IF relative to the SF PRLRs on cells leads to cell proliferation and survival,
whereas increased expression of SFs relative to LF/IF inhibits proliferation, promotes differentiation, and induces
apoptosis. We hypothesized that PRL, by signaling specifically through the pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic
LF/IFPRLR, promotes the malignant transformation of B cells, and establishes and sustains the growth of overt
B-cell malignancies. To test our hypothesis, we measured changes in B cells in vivo in SLE- and DLBCL/BL-
prone mouse models and in vitro in human B-cell malignancies after specifically knocking down expression of
the LF/IFPRLR using a non-toxic splice modulating oligomer (SMO). The LFPRLR SMO prevents the synthesis
of the LFPRLR in mice and the LF/IFPRLR in humans without affecting the SFPRLRs. Knockdown of
LFPRLR reduced the numbers of pathogenic B-cell subsets in SLE- and DLBCL/BL-prone mice and lowered the
risk of B-cell transformation in SLE-prone mice by downregulating expression of the activation-induced cytidine
deaminase (AID) enzyme, whose overexpression we previously showed, drives the evolution of B-cell
neoplasms. We found that overt human B-cell neoplasms aberrantly express autocrine PRL and sometimes only
the LF/IFPRLR. Knockdown of LF/IFPRLR in overt B-cell malignancies reduced cell viability, downstream STAT3
activation, and expression of MYC and BCL2. Our preliminary findings warrant detailed studies of molecular
pathways underlying the disturbances in B cells downstream of LF/IFPRLR in SLE-prone mice that are
vulnerable to transformation (Aim 1), in mice with pre-malignant B-cell clones prone to overt B-cell malignancies
(Aim 2), and in overt human B-cell neoplasms (Aim 3). Our research will solidify isoform-specific suppression
of the production of LF/IFPRLR as a therapeutic strategy in SLE that concurrently lowers the incidence of B-
cell malignancies in these patients (Aim 1), in people with pre-malignant and indolent B cells who are vulnerable
to developing aggressive B-cell malignancies (Aim 2), and in overt B-cell neoplasms (Aim 3)."

Comprehensive behavioral treatments are effective at promoting weight loss and improving clinical outcomes
among adults with obesity. However, a large majority of individuals with obesity never take the first step of
initiating these treatments (even when barriers to cost and access are reduced), severely limiting the
population impact of evidence-based weight management treatments. To address this challenge and take
advantage of growing access to comprehensive weight loss treatments, our team has developed a tool
designed to increase initiation of evidence-based behavioral weight loss treatments among eligible but non-
treatment seeking adults (“mobilization tool”). As part of this tool, patients answer brief questions and receive
automated, individually tailored feedback. This feedback targets empirically and theoretically relevant
constructs for treatment initiation using a Motivational Interviewing approach that supports patient autonomy.
The tool is completed by patients in the days prior to a scheduled primary care appointment and contains
explicit endorsement by patients’ primary care provider (PCPs), taking advantage of PCPs’ influence while not
relying on PCPs to initiate weight counseling. It is also designed to be low burden and high acceptability to
PCPs to facilitate dissemination, if effective. We previously conducted a cluster randomized feasibility pilot trial
to inform plans for a fully powered test of the effectiveness of the mobilization tool. The pilot showed that the
tool was highly usable, informative, and enjoyable; feasibility goals were met; and a signal of an effect was
observed. We are now prepared to conduct an adequately powered cluster randomized clinical trial to compare
the effects of the mobilization tool and a static treatment description (comparator tool), and to examine how
effects differ across key demographic factors. We will recruit and randomize PCPs (n=36) and patients with
obesity (n=828) who have an upcoming appointment with enrolled PCPs. All enrolled patients will complete
either the mobilization tool or the comparator tool, depending on their randomization arm, and will be informed
that they have free access to comprehensive weight loss treatment. We will compare the two study arms on
the proportion who initiate weight loss treatment (primary outcome), session attendance, and weight loss
outcomes at 6 months (secondary outcomes). Because weight loss programs historically have had lower
uptake by individuals who are men, Black/African American, younger, have lower income, and have lower
educational attainment, we will recruit a diverse population to allow for comparisons of effects across gender,
race, age, income, and education. If effective, the proposed mobilization tool could be disseminated within
primary care practices to increase the number of adults with obesity who initiate evidence-based weight loss
treatment, resulting in greater population weight loss and meaningful changes in population health."

 Congenital heart defects (CHDs) affect nearly 1% of live births in the United States. CHDs are associated with high
morbidity and are the most common birth defect-related cause of death. Rapid advancement in the early diagnosis, medical
management, and treatment of CHD have led to tremendous gains in survival; however, heart failure (HF) is the leading
cause of death in adults with CHD. This makes identifying the risk factors of HF across the lifespan critical so that
individuals at the highest risk can be identified and managed. We have brought together a multi-disciplinary team with
significant experience in population-based CHD outcomes, social determinants of health, and cardiovascular genetics to fill
these critical knowledge gaps. Since 2008, our team has led the North Carolina Congenital Heart Disease Surveillance
Network (NC-CHD) which links the 5 major academic centers in North Carolina in a surveillance network for the vast
majority of patients with CHD in the state. NC-CHD links clinical records to a variety of robust, state, and national databases
to conduct outcomes-based research on survivors of CHD across the lifespan. This puts our team in a unique position to
establish a prospectively enrolled cohort of CHD survivors with rich clinical phenotyping for comprehensive genetic and
outcomes-based research to determine the causes of HF in this population. The goal of our study is to develop a large, well-
curated, population-based cohort of individuals with CHD in the state of North Carolina (NC-DEFINE) to identify social
determinants of health and genetic factors which influence CHD outcomes, specifically HF. We hypothesize that social
determinants of health and rare genetic variants localizing to sarcomeric genes are associated with HF development among
survivors of CHD. To test this hypothesis, we propose 3 specific aims: 1) To identify the social determinants of health
associated with the development of HF in cohort of 600 patients with CHD which will comprise NC-DEFINE. 2) To
determine the coding genetic variants associated with the development of HF among patients with CHD in NC-DEFINE.
3) To determine the functional impact of candidate variants associated with HF in CHD using patient-derived cardiac
myocytes. If we are successful, this project will allow for identification of CHD patients at heightened risk of HF based on
either social or genetic risk, allowing for informed counseling at the time of surgical repair and early intervention to control
reversible risk factors associated with HF. Further, NC-DEFINE will lay the foundation for a genomic medicine-based
approach to predicting CHD prognosis and outcomes."

Complex V (CV, or ATP synthase) of the electron transport chain is the central enzyme of cellular energy
capture. CV synthesizes ATP driven by the proton gradient generated by the electron transport chain. The
advent of clinical gene sequencing has highlighted the devastating effects of deficiency of this critical enzyme.
Pathogenic variants in CV subunits give rise to multi-system disease, including strokes, neuropathy, ataxia,
retinopathy, and cardiomyopathy. Genetic variation in CV is frequent, and the inability to distinguish pathogenic
mutations from the variants of unknown significance is a clinical challenge preventing understanding of
prognosis and rational approach to management. However, no clinical test for CV function exists. This thwarts
our ability to classify genetic variants. Our Goal is to develop a biochemical approach to evaluating CV function
and ultimately predicting the clinical significance of CV variants. We previously demonstrated that basal ATP
levels are normal with CV deficiency while the rate of ATP synthesis can be low, suggesting that clinical
symptoms result from an inability of CV to accommodate an increased metabolic demand. Direct enzymatic
testing of ATP synthesis by CV is impossible, as the substrate for CV is the proton motive force, which is
dissipated when the enzyme is purified. We therefore propose to assay ATP flux in our human cell (fibroblast,
transmitochondrial cybrid) models of diverse CV genetic variants, including novel candidate genes. We have
observed that the biochemical effects of CV variants result in diverse biochemical sequelae; therefore, we will
also assay oxygen consumption, mitochondrial membrane potential, matrix pH, CV assembly, and
mitochondrial cristae structure and correlate results with clinical manifestations. We anticipate that this
approach will furnish a biochemical and morphologic profile that informs the pathogenicity of the variant. We
hypothesize that the observation that steady-state ATP levels are normal in CV deficient cell-lines despite low
enzymatic flux implies that CV function is responsive to cellular metabolic state. We will introduce a series of
provocative (stimulus-response) testing procedures that involve modulation of nutrient levels (glucose, αKG)
and exposure to cell stress (galactose, lipopolysaccharide). By rigorously investigating the biochemical
consequences of CV deficiency including in dynamic models of cellular stress, we will establish the foundation
on which to develop clinical diagnostic assays to confirm CV mutation pathogenicity and treatment response.
The Central Hypothesis of this proposal is: pathogenic variants in CV subunit genes evoke changes in CV
bioenergic function resulting in diverse downstream biochemical defects that predict clinical presentation.
Further, we propose that the clinical manifestations of Complex V deficiency severity are influenced by the
biochemical and nutritional milieu in which the genetic deficiency finds itself. Experimental manipulation of this
milieu may identify nutritional therapeutic approaches."

Cell death is a crucial physiological process. The resistance of cancer cells to therapeutic drugs is a significant
barrier to successful cancer treatment and the primary factor in cancer recurrence. Activation of novel cell death
pathways would resensitize drug-resistant cells to chemotherapy. Ferroptosis is a nonapoptotic cell death
activated when the lipid in the cell undergoes iron-dependent peroxidation. Our overarching goal is to investigate
lipid metabolism-driven cell death through the modulation of ferroptosis in cell culture and in vivo models of drug-
resistant cancer. The results will provide fundamental insights into the molecular chemistry of ferroptosis and its
role in disease pathology by developing a multi-omics approach with single-cell resolution. Diseases like cancer,
sepsis, pre-eclampsia, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative illnesses correlate with lipids
and lipid metabolism dysregulation. Lipid distributions are heterogeneous, and their chemical modifications, such
as lipid peroxidation, are potentially crucial for disease onset and progression. However, the precise relationship
between lipid distribution and their chemical modification and disease pathology is not fully understood. This
project investigates changes in lipid distribution and lipid peroxidation both in vitro and in tissues to provide
fundamental insights into their molecular chemistry and its role in disease pathology by using the experimental
methods developed in our group based on spatial chemical imaging. Our approach uses Raman imaging to
provide spatial information about lipids in the defined cellular compartments in contrast to the bulk or fractionated
examinations of extracted lipids provided by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). This proposal
builds upon our prior success in performing spatial imaging of lipid distribution in cells and tissues. The
hypotheses underlying this effort are that (a) there are significant heterogeneities in lipid distributions and their
chemical modifications, and (b) these heterogeneities can be correlated to the pathology of the disease. In
particular, we will: 1) Investigate the effect of ferroptosis on the lipid metabolism and iron metabolism of drug-
resistant cell lines in 2D culture; 2) Perform spatial mapping and profiling of lipids during ferroptosis in 3D cell
culture; 3) Detect ferroptosis and identify its associated mechanism in vivo. The project outcomes will improve
our understanding of the molecular mechanism, disease phenotype, and disease progression leading to better
therapeutic strategies."
10893605,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overarching goal of our research program is to couple computational tools with three-dimensional models
of epithelial barriers to interrogate how the epithelial extracellular matrix (ECM) is influenced by extrinsic factors,
how changes to the epithelial ECM affect drug delivery, and how the epithelial ECM can be harnessed to tailor
drug bioavailability. Epithelial barriers are what lies between us and the outside world, serving as protective
barriers and sites of selective permeability. For each type of epithelial tissue, each layer of stratified epithelium
has its own unique ECM, a complex network of fibrous proteins that provides mechanical and chemical cues that
drive cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, cell polarity, and migration. Dysregulation of epithelial barriers can
be indicative of local or systemic disease and permeability of epithelial barriers directly affects how drug is
delivered across the ECM and into the circulation. Recently, it has been appreciated that the ECM cannot be
fully studied as the fibrous proteins alone, but instead should be evaluated as the interconnected network of
proteins that make up the structural core of the ECM along with proteins that are critical to ECM function and
maintenance such as receptors and ECM-bound soluble factors. This interconnected network has been defined
as the matrisome, a curated collection of 1027 genes, roughly 4% of the known human proteome. While the
roles of individual ECM proteins and ECM downstream signaling networks on epithelial function and permeability
have been investigated, three key knowledge gaps persist: 1) How does the epithelial matrisome change with
extrinsic factors such as age, menstrual cycle, and inflammation? 2) How do changes to the epithelial matrisome
affect drug absorption and transport? 3) How can we modulate the epithelial matrisome for selective
bioavailability? To address the first knowledge gap, in Project 1 we will evaluate publicly available datasets and
biospecimens using our novel machine learning and image analysis techniques to reveal the interconnected
relationships between matrisome changes and extrinsic factors such as age, menstrual cycle phase, and
immune landscape. These studies will be complemented by orthogonal in vitro studies using our library of tissue
engineered models that capture the layered morphology of epithelium. To address the second knowledge gap,
in Project 2 we will couple our in vitro models with statistical modeling and systems biology tools to determine
key matrisome proteins that influence drug delivery across epithelial surfaces and their corresponding
mechanisms of action. Lastly, to address the third knowledge gap, in Project 3 we will identify novel compounds
that modulate bioavailability through matrisome-driven mechanisms, opening new avenues of direction for the
design and delivery of novel therapeutics with selective bioavailability. Critically, the methods that we are
developing are tissue, organ, and disease agnostic, facilitating an increased understanding of a wide variety of
biological processes at a molecular, cellular, and tissue level."
10894091,"Project Summary
Heteroatom units, such as C(sp3)–OH and C(sp3)–NH2, are prevalent motifs in many pharmaceutically
relevant drugs and natural products. Methods to incorporate these important functional groups at the expense
of C–H bonds rely on the use of non-commercial heteroatom transfer agents, precious transition metals,
and/or costly engineered enzymes. Also, these methods often require harsh exogenous oxidants to promote the
C–heteroatom bonding event, which greatly limits substrate scope. In this proposal, we highlight the
employment of economical nitroarenes as versatile reagents that can serve as the C(sp3)–H bond activator and
the oxygen atom source for the C–H hydroxylation of aliphatic systems under benign visible-light irradiation.
Notably, the heteroatom transfer event occurs anaerobically, thereby allowing for significant expansion of
substrate scope compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. Asymmetric C–H hydroxylation protocols can
be achieved with the use of recyclable photoexcited nitroarene atropisomers, leading to a sustainable approach
for the late-stage installation of chiral alcohol groups. The development of a universal platform for C–H
heteroatom incorporation of aliphatic systems can be engendered under this reaction paradigm via a formal
polar crossover event and coupling with nucleophiles. The merger of chiral H-bond donor catalysts or chiral
phosphoric acid catalysts to this approach can enable a general platform for asymmetric heteroatom
incorporation directly from C–H bonds without the need for a leaving group, which is an underdeveloped area
in synthesis. For C–N bond formation, chemoselective transfer of the nitrogen atom from the nitroarene
moiety to aliphatic systems can be achieved under photoirradiation empowering facile formation of imines
directly from methylene units. In-situ hydrogenation of the formed imine products generates amines formally
from C–H bonds; thus, resulting in a C–H amination event from the multi-fold reactivity of photoexcited
nitroarenes. The synthetic utility of the proposed protocols illustrates that late-stage C–H heteroatom
incorporation events promoted by photoexcited nitroarenes can provide a cost-effective means for the
synthesis of complex molecular scaffolds. Overall, novel C–H heteroatom events can be achieved in a mild,
general, and sustainable manner by exploiting the multifunctional role of photoinduced nitroarenes. It is
anticipated that photoexcited nitroarenes will serve as useful tools for the anaerobic heteroatom incorporation
of organic molecules."
10910165,"Although the field has made substantial progress in understanding how anesthetics induce unconsciousness,
amnesia, and immobilization, the exact mechanisms remain poorly understood. Furthermore, all sedative-
hypnotic agents cause undesirable adverse effects. Thus, there is a need to discover new sedative-hypnotics
and to advance our knowledge of their mechanism(s) of action. We previously found that the anesthetic,
propofol, interfered with electron transfer within mitochondria at the level of coenzyme Q (CoQ) and induced
excessive proton leak. These “two-hits” combined to compromise the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm)
by degrading the proton motive force and preventing the requisite ramp up in electron flux to regenerate it. In
preliminary work, we observed that synthetic CoQ analogs (members of the 1,4-benzoquinone class) cause a
similar increase in mitochondrial leak and precipitate a decline in ΔΨm. Extending these observations, we
found that tail vein injection of the short-chain CoQ analog, ubiquinone-5 (Ub5), immediately induced
unconsciousness in mice. These provocative findings led us to our global hypothesis: 1,4-benzoquinones
represent a novel class of sedative-hypnotics. We specifically hypothesize that Ub5 induces unconsciousness
by compromising ΔΨm. Thus, the aims are designed to: 1) characterize the anesthetic effects of Ub5 and 2)
determine how Ub5 prevents forebrain mitochondria from generating an adequate ΔΨm. The third aim is
designed to identify the neuronal aspartate-glutamate mitochondrial carrier, Aralar, as a novel
pharmacologically relevant anesthetic target. The basis for this aim is our preliminary data demonstrating that
Aralar is a major source of Ub5-mediated proton leak. In specific aim #3 we will determine the role of Aralar in
mediating Ub5-induced unconsciousness. Success of the proposal will establish Ub5 as a novel anesthetic
agent and elucidate discrete mitochondrial mechanisms of action. Knowledge gained will permit us to discover
sedative-hypnotics with precise mitochondrial targets in future work; maximizing on-target therapeutic
biological activity and minimizing off-target toxic effects."
10931467,"The long-term objective of the proposed project is to reduce excess mortality and improve life expectancy for
people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The specific aims are to: 1) determine age- and sex-specific
mortality risk in Medicaid beneficiaries with and without ASD; 2) examine cause-specific mortality risk in
Medicaid beneficiaries with and without ASD; 3) identify effect modifiers (e.g., gender and intellectual disability)
of mortality risk associated with ASD; and 4) assess racial and ethnic disparities in mortality risk in Medicaid
beneficiaries with and without ASD. In the United States, the reported prevalence of ASD among children aged
8 years has more than tripled over the past two decades, increasing from 6.7 per 1,000 in 2000 to 23.0 per
1000 in 2018. There were an estimated 6.9 million persons with ASD in the United States, including over 1.5
million children aged 3-17 years and 5.4 million adults aged 18-84 years. As a complex neurodevelopmental
disability, ASD often requires extensive lifetime health care and social services. Research on ASD has been
largely concentrated in understanding its biology, identifying risk factors, monitoring prevalence in children, and
evaluating treatments and interventions. Although substantially reduced life expectancy for individuals with
ASD has been speculated since the early 1990s, research on mortality and lifespan issues in autism remains
scant. Medicaid, including the Children’s Health Insurance Program, is the primary public insurance program
for individuals with ASD. The proposed project involves constructing a dynamic cohort of about 1 million
Medicaid beneficiaries with ASD and about 4 million Medicaid beneficiaries without ASD (two million matched
with the exposed cohort on state, year of enrollment, age at enrollment, and sex; and two million matched
additionally on type of eligibility) and analyzing longitudinal data over a 24-year study period (1999–2022).
Results from the proposed project will provide much-needed epidemiologic evidence for understanding the life-
course mortality risk, causes of death, effect modifiers of mortality risk, and racial and ethnic disparities in
mortality risk associated with ASD, and for developing effective interventions to reduce excess mortality and
informing health policy and service planning for people with ASD."

Colorectal cancer is a heterogenous disease influenced by somatic mutations, microbiota, host immunity,
and risk factor exposures, necessitating integrative research approaches to better understand the etiology.
The proposed project plans to integrates immunology and microbiology into molecular pathological
epidemiology (MPE) to gain insights into the interactive role of exposures, microbiota, immune cells, and
tumor cells in colorectal cancer and adenoma. This project also plans to develop novel statistical and
computational methods for such research. This project leverages tumor tissue datasets in various
populations, including the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHS2, Health Professionals Follow-up Study,
Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO), Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC),
Partners Colonoscopy Cohort (PCC), and CALGB/SWOG 80702 trials. Our multi-level databases have
accumulated information on long-term lifestyle factors and tumoral features of colorectal cancer (CRC) and
adenoma. Our research involves the assessment of various immune cells and microbiota in tumor tissue
using multispectral assays combined with digital image analyses and machine learning algorithms.
Characteristics of molecular pathology, microorganisms, and immunity in tumor tissue will shed light on the
carcinogenic process. Diet and lifestyle factors will be assessed in relation to incidence of CRC (or
adenoma) subtyped by microbial and/or immune features, and in relation to clinical outcomes of these tumor
subtypes. The MPE approach is expected to reveal currently unknown risk and prognostic factors for CRC
and early-onset CRC, the incidence of which has increased globally for uncertain reasons. Moreover,
examining effects of modifiable lifestyle factors on immune cells and microorganisms in tumor tissue will
open new ways to develop personalized preventive strategies. Efforts will be made to replicate findings
using other independent datasets whenever possible. New statistical methods will address analytical issues
such as continuous subtyping, missing biomarker data, intratumor spatial variations, high-dimensional tumor
data, mediation analyses, and prediction models. Furthermore, novel computational algorithms will be
developed to decipher the spatial patterns of immune cell subsets and tumor cells in the tumor
microenvironment. Integrative epidemiological analyses of immunology and microbiology will generate
provide the scientific foundation for exploring roles of anti-tumor immunity and microbiota in CRC
development. In addition, this project will advance population cancer sciences via the development of new
statistical and computational methods."

This proposal describes a research and career development plan for Zhengjie Zhou, Ph.D., to transit from a
postdoctoral fellow to an independent investigator position. This proposal will be based on Dr. Zhou’s past
years of multidisciplinary research in nanomedicine and vascular research. Dr. Zhou will be trained at the
University of Chicago by a superb advisory committee of experts who are world-renowned scientists including
Dr. Yun Fang (primary mentor), Dr. Matthew Tirrell (co-mentor), Dr. Jeffrey Hubbell, Dr. Gökhan Mutlu and Dr.
Glenn Randall. This proposal tests the overall hypothesis of fabricated novel lung-targeting liposomal
nanoparticles to deliver therapeutic mRNA in a cell-specific manner for the treatment of acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS), which is the major cause of death for severe influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Currently, efficient medicines are still lacking for ARDS therapy. ARDS is characterized by the dysfunction of
endothelial cells (ECs), epithelial cells and the following uncontrolled cytokine storm. Based on our recent
research about a vascular cell adhesion molecular-1 (VCAM1) targeting nanotherapeutic study, I rationally
designed and optimized a targeting liposomal nanoparticle that enables robust mRNA delivery in vivo in a cell-
specific manner. Leveraging this mRNA delivery platform, We propose to (i) promote endothelium health by
endothelial cell-specific delivery of KLF2 mRNA to restore KLF2, a transcription factor, that plays a key role in
facilitating endothelial health and vasculature homeostasis. KLF2 was demonstrated significantly reduced in
mice lungs induced by LPS, influenza H1N1, SARS-CoV-2, and COVID-19 patients lungs; (ii) activate
epithelial cells innate immune pathway by epithelium-specific delivery of 2’-5’-oligoadenylate synthetase 1
(OAS1) mRNA to augment epithelium interferon (IFN) response through OAS/RNase L pathway to defense
respiratory viral infection. Our data demonstrated that KLF2 mRNA/VCAM1-targeting liposome targeted the
inflamed mice lungs endothelium and significantly reduced the ARDS induced by H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2. Our
preliminary data demonstrated the OAS1 mRNA/epithelium-targeting liposome targeted the mice inflamed lung
epithelium and significantly reduced the H1N1 replication and lung ARDS. In this project, I will
comprehensively evaluate the therapeutic potency of VCAM1-targeting liposome to restore endothelial KLF2
and lessen ARDS induced by (i) H1N1, or (ii) SARS-CoV-2 in mouse models (Aim 1, K99), and in a clinically
relevant rat ARDS model induced by high-tidal ventilation (HTV) (Aim 2, K99/R00). I will determine how
epithelium-targeted delivery of OAS1 activates the innate immune response and exerts antiviral effects in mice
by OAS1 mRNA/epithelium-targeting liposome and will determine its therapeutic effect to treat respiratory virus
induced ARDS (Aim 3, R00). Successful complete these projects will provide a promising mRNA therapeutic
treating lung disease and provide an “effective responder” in viral pandemics regardless of virus evolution and
mutation. This mRNA delivery platform is adaptable and potentially beneficial for various diseases treatment."

I am a well-published, early stage medical sociologist applying for a NIDA-funded Racial Equity Visionary Award
focused on the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of an innovative, mixed methods, community-
engaged intervention targeting non-Hispanic Black (NHB) individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). This study
will apply my understanding of community needs and OUD, to test a novel intervention in a scalable setting,
leveraging my role as a leader in this field to disseminate findings and improve treatment access nationwide.
Opioid-related overdoses are increasing fastest in NHB individuals. In 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, NHB
overdose deaths increased by 45%, nearly double the increase in non-Hispanic Whites (NHW). Disproportionate
increases in overdoses correspond to racial inequities in OUD treatment access and utilization. An effective
treatment, buprenorphine, is concentrated among communities with high percentages of NHWs, higher income,
and private insurance. Compared with NHW patients with OUD, NHB patients with OUD are 77% less likely to
have an office visit that includes a buprenorphine prescription, despite similar prevalence of OUDs. This
structural problem is at the foundation of my proposed research. Research focused on developing and testing
culturally effective, community grounded, and structurally competent OUD treatments with rigorous
implementation assessments is urgently needed to intervene on structural barriers to OUD treatment that
operate in settings in which NHB individuals seek healthcare. Significant federal funding has expanded access to
OUD treatment services in Community Health Centers (CHCs) that provide care to underserved populations and
areas but barriers to accessing care remain in NHBs. I propose to prepare for a fully powered clinical trial by
testing whether a buprenorphine treatment intervention protocol (Racial Equity in Systems to Treat Opioid Use
Disorder for Everyone—RESTORE) that targets structural barriers to OUD treatment for NHB individuals is
feasible in the context of CHCs. RESTORE draws upon concepts of structural competency, peer navigation, and
culturally grounded OUD education for both patients and providers. Community engagement will be continuous,
exemplified by the use of peer navigators to connect patients to care. RESTORE will be based in Southern
California—an epicenter of the nation’s opioid crisis. Project Phases, guided by cutting edge implementation
science, include 1) a qualitative investigation into provider and patient barriers to and facilitators of CHCs’
provision of buprenorphine specifically to NHB individuals with OUD; 2) the operationalization of RESTORE into
routine care, using preliminary findings from Phase I; and 3) a pilot stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial
to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of RESTORE, as well as the protocols, procedures
and training in CHCs. This study has the potential to improve effective treatment rates in 4 clinics and provide
an evidence-based intervention to be tested at scale across multiple states. Improvements in local treatments,
designed to reach NHBs, will greatly reduce the current increase in overdose disparities."

Ketogenic diet (KD), a high fat low carbohydrate diet is used to treat intractable epilepsy, is becoming increasingly
popular for weight management, and it can potentially slow cognitive ageing and alleviate symptoms of
neurological disorders such as stroke, Parkinsons disease, and Alzheimers. However, KD also causes bone loss
and increases fracture risk in children. It is not known if KD causes bone loss in adults. Based on prior studies,
it is also possible that KD may reduce the ability for exercise to increase bone strength. The mechanisms
responsible for KD bone loss have not been identified. Determining if β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), the most
abundant ketone body is linked to bone loss is important, because this molecule is thought to lay a large role in
the neurological benefits of KD. This project will use a mouse model to evaluate age differences in ketogenic
diet induced bone loss, determine if KD decreases the ability of exercise to make bone stronger, and investigate
if BHB causes bone loss.
 Aim 1 will determine how age and diet duration affect the magnitude of KD induced bone loss and
decrease in bone strength. Aim 2 will evaluate if KD reduces the ability of exercise to increase bone strength
and if this is mediated by muscle and tendon. Aim 3 will focus specifically on defining the role of BHB in bone
loss. In the long term, this project will help clarify how KD affects bone, and it can contribute to the use of KD or
BHB supplementation to deliver neurological benefits without increasing fracture risk.
 As a clinical researcher, I strive to develop therapies to improve skeletal health, and as a biological
anthropologist, I use skeletal remains to reconstruct the behavior and health of past people. Through the
K99/R00 career development award, I seek to combine the anthropological and biomedical strands of my
research career by examining the combined effect of ketogenic diet and exercise on bone health throughout life.
During the fellowship, I will receive training in molecular biology and laboratory skills essential for the study of
cellular responses to diet and exercise. I will also expand my knowledge of muscle and tendon, gaining the ability
to conduct innovative interdisciplinary research that achieves new perspectives on how exercise and diet affect
bone strength. UC Davis is an unparalleled location for conducting the proposed project and training. I will have
access to cutting edge facilities and equipment. Through numerous seminars, workshops, and training
opportunities I will interact with faculty, students, and staff, broadening my understanding of skeletal health.
Through the K99/ R00 I will develop an innovative interdisciplinary research career that explores the relationship
between diet, behavior, and health in past human populations and contributes to the development of therapies
that use diet and exercise to decrease fracture risk."

Chronic rhinosinusitis represents a significant healthcare burden, yet the cellular and molecular mechanisms
driving disease are unclear in part, from a lack of clinically relevant mouse models. Allergic fungal rhinosinusitis
(AFRS) is characterized by exacerbated sneezing, type 2 inflammatory response, eosinophilia and high numbers
of specialized epithelial cells called sinonasal tuft cells (STCs) in response to fungal allergen exposure. It is
currently not known how allergens are detected and inflammation is initiated in sinonasal mucosa. Trigeminal
(TG) sensory neurons that innervate the respiratory epithelium sit in close apposition to STCs. TG neurons that
express the Transient Receptor Potential Channel Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) are required for sneezing, but it is not
known if they become sensitized by allergen and progressively increase sneezing. To address these knowledge
gaps, we have developed a mouse model of AFRS using chronic intranasal (i.n.) administration of a fungal
allergen mix (FAM) that recapitulates all the cellular and cytokine-associated features of AFRS. Preliminary data
show that ablation of intranasal TRPV1+ neurons, and perhaps other cell types, blocks STC expansion and
eosinophil recruitment and reduces sneezing. Intranasal treatment of mice with the neuropeptide substance SP
alone induces STC expansion and sneezing and cultured TG neurons exposed to fungal allergen secrete SP in
and adaptive manner; showing greater secretion of SP when previously exposed to fungal allergen. Curiously,
the adaptive increase in allergen-induced SP was lost in mice with a genetic deficiency in the alarmin cytokine
interleukin (IL)-33. Taken together, we hypothesize that sinonasal TRPV1+ neurons respond to fungal
allergens by releasing SP, which in turn, directs STC expansion from progenitor cells, leading to allergic
inflammation, and excessive sneezing. We will test this hypothesis in two complementary, but independent
aims. Aim 1 will identify the SP-responsive cells that promote STC expansion and allergic inflammation.
This will be done in three sub-aims using transgenic mice that allow either gain (1A) or loss (1B) of function
approach to either activate or ablate epithelial and immune cells receiving the SP signal and evaluate the cellular
profile and sneezing behavior associated with those treatments. In 1C, we will perform single cell RNA
sequencing in progenitor cells to establish how SP and fungal allergen instruct their differentiation into STC. Aim
2 seeks to define the neuron-specific contribution to fungal allergen-induced inflammatory responses
and test whether selective loss of IL-33 responsive nociceptive neurons blocks allergic disease
pathophysiology. In 2A we will use bone marrow chimeras of TRPV1+cre-DTR mice to determine the relative
contribution of different TRPV1+ cell types to our previous findings. In 2B we will test whether mice with a
selective loss of IL-33 responsiveness in nociceptive neurons are protected against excessive sneezing, STC
expansion, and innate immune responses following one or more exposures to FAM."

 The ability of cells to recognize and respond to extrinsic and intrinsic perturbations is critical for their
survival. Recent studies have shown that the status of translating ribosomes is constantly monitored by
surveillance factors to determine signs of translational distress. For example, the exposure of cells to ultraviolet
radiation and reactive oxygen species causes transcriptome-wide RNA damage and prolonged stalling of
ribosomes within the coding sequence of damaged messenger RNAs triggers ribosomal collisions. Recently, our
laboratory has shown that the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase ZAK, and the general control
nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) kinase are activated on collided ribosomes to trigger activation of the Ribotoxic and
Integrated Stress Response programs (RSR and ISR) respectively.
 The goal of my proposal is to understand how the cell mounts a measured ZAK- and GCN2-mediated
response that depends on the pervasiveness of ribosome collisions to determine cell fate. In preliminary
experiments, I performed quantitative time-resolved phosphoproteomics to determine the temporal order of
activation of signaling cascades in cells responding to ribotoxic stress. The data thus generated is providing an
unprecedented high-resolution atlas of signaling events occurring in response to ribosome collisions and will be
further explored in two proposed aims. In Aim 1, I will determine how ZAK is activated in response to ribosomal
collisions and regulates cell fate outcomes through activation of the p38 and JNK signaling cascades. I will also
test how a negative-feedback loop for ZAK enables cells to mount a measured response to ribotoxic stress.
These studies will employ biochemical, quantitative proteomics, and live cell imaging approaches. In Aim 2, I
will determine how GCN2 regulates the ISR pathway, and JNK and mTOR activity in response to ribotoxic stress
by genetically and chemically perturbing GCN2’s kinase activity. Finally, I will test how co-factors and regulators
of GCN2 set the threshold for its activation in response to ribosomal collisions. Together, the successful
completion of these complementary approaches will provide foundational mechanistic insights into how the RSR
and ISR pathways are coordinated by ZAK and GCN2 to regulate cell fate decisions during ribotoxic stress.
 Towards this, the experiments proposed will enable me to develop new skills and technologies in
quantitative proteomics and live-cell imaging approaches, which will allow me to substantially differentiate my
own research program from that of my mentor Dr. Green. I am confident that the team of collaborators that I
have assembled and the accompanying training plan, will be instrumental in the growth and development of my
independent research program and prepare me for a tenure-track position."

The identity and spatial context of biomolecules (e.g., protein and RNA) in cancer cells are crucial components
of their pathology. Therefore, a scalable and multiplexed imaging platform that can simultaneously map the
protein and RNA landscapes tissue would be a vital tool towards deeply profiling and mapping cancer cell types
in their spatial context. Extensive efforts have been made toward this end to reveal unprecedented details at
both cellular level and molecular level. However, these methods generally lack high multiplexity or suffer low
sensitivity as the target abundance decreases. In addition, highly multiplexed methods for co-imaging of protein
and RNA at the whole tissue level still lag behind. We here aim to address these limitations by developing a
versatile imaging platform for highly multiplexed, rapid, scalable proteomic and transcriptomic mapping of cell
line and mammalian tissue samples with high-plex signal amplification. We propose to (Aim 1) develop a simple,
highly controllable polymerase mediated iterative in situ DNA extension (ISE) and concatenation. We will
demonstrate the application of ISE on the imaging of protein and RNA targets in both tissue and cell sample with
high signal-to-noise and signal specificity. We will also (Aim 2) validate the scalability of ISE imaging in cell and
tissue samples. We will optimize the technology to achieve spatial mapping of 50 to 100-plex protein and RNA
targets in mammalian tissue samples. Finally, we will (Aim 3) validate ISE imaging in both FFPE and thick tissue,
both normal and cancerous sample types. We will co-detect both RNA and protein tumor biomarkers in clinical
FFPE samples and finally, we will integrate the ISE imaging methods with existing tissue clearing methods
(iDISCO, CLARITY, etc.) to enable high-throughput and highly multiplexed tissue imaging from cellular level to
molecular level for both normal and cancerous brain tissue. We will establish a platform for 50-plex imaging in
hundreds micrometer to millimeter thick mammalian tissue specimens to unveil unprecedented detail in the
tissue. The proposed work will deliver a comprehensive imaging toolset including a low-cost, simple design of
orthogonal DNA probes for multiplexing imaging on protein and RNA molecules, and a scalable signal
amplification method for multiplexed fluorescence imaging in different types of tissues. We envision that our
technologies will be widely accessible and seamlessly incorporated into the pipelines, workflows, and coordinate
frameworks of the mission for clinical researchers, pathologists, as well as the wider bio-imaging community to
facilitate cancer research and clinical practice."

When poor communication between clinicians and family members of ICU patients, disparities related to social
determinants of health (SDOH), and a heightened distrust of healthcare professionals all coalesced during the
COVID-19 pandemic, “the perfect storm” emerged. Improving communication and trust in healthcare
professionals is critical in high-stakes ICU environments where the need for shared decision-making demands
that clinicians rapidly establish rapport and therapeutic alliance with family members of non-capacitated
patients. Many well-designed trials testing ICU communication interventions have had negative or minimally
impactful results, perhaps in part because we have only a rudimentary understanding of how SDOH impact
communication in the ICU, a clinical context where underrepresented individuals also suffer from disparities.
The goals of this R01 are to conduct a mediation analysis that will: 1) examine SDOH’s impact on
communication between family members and ICU clinicians; 2) identify mechanisms of action related to how
communication quality affects distrust of healthcare professionals and therapeutic alliance; and 3) determine
how these factors contribute to or mediate outcomes for family members of ICU patients. This longitudinal,
observational study will collect data from 320 family members from 5 ICUs serving underrepresented rural,
Black, and Hispanic communities in 3 states. Our primary health outcome is the provision of family-centered
care (as measured by the Patient Perceptions of Patient Centeredness questionnaire- Family Version).
Secondary health outcomes include family members’ psychological stress (anxiety, depression, symptoms of
post-traumatic stress disorder) and measures of patient ICU utilization (e.g., ICU LOS, ventilator days).
Mediating factors to be examined include communication quality, healthcare distrust, and therapeutic alliance.
Moderating factors include family members’ intrinsic traits (e.g., personality traits and decision-making style).
We hypothesize that: 1) poor SDOH yield poor outcomes and result in less attention to family-centered care
and worse ICU patient utilization outcomes; and 2) higher communication quality will improve the therapeutic
relationship and healthcare trust and result in improved attention to family-centered care and improved ICU
patient utilization outcomes among all patients regardless of SDOH. Using our results, we will adapt a
prominent conceptual model of communication to address the high-stakes communication needs of families
from underserved communities. Completing this work will advance the field by providing data to allow new
understanding of how SDOH and other factors (e.g., communication quality, trust) relate to provision of patient-
and family-centered care in the post-pandemic context. The knowledge gained will inform new content and
concrete communication strategies for future ICU interventions aiming to facilitate high-quality communication,
help to restore trust in healthcare, and improve therapeutic alliances in pursuit of achieving patient- and family-
centered ICU care."
10888404,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tumor cells and infiltrating immune cells co-evolve during the course of tumor progression, with the immune
system progressively losing its efficacy as tumors advance. Immune cells are highly dependent on cellular
metabolism to manifest their effector functions, but in the tumor microenvironment (TME), ‘metabolic competition’
with rapidly proliferating cancer cells leads to nutrient deprivation alongside increased metabolic waste, both of
which negatively impact immune cell function. Moreover, ‘metabolic symbiosis’ between cancer and immune
cells can promote the acquisition of suppressive immune cell phenotypes, ultimately disfavoring anti-tumor
immunity. These dynamic metabolic interactions are shaped by the niches occupied by cells within the TME.
Thus, the metabolic cross talk between tumor and immune cells over the course of tumor progression can be a
major determinant of immune cell function and, consequently, response to immune-targeted therapies.
Unfortunately, the study of immune cell metabolism and crosstalk in the TME has been very challenging due to
reliance on methods that analyze metabolism in bulk cell populations, which obscures individual cellular diversity,
difficulties in predicting downstream outcomes of metabolic perturbations because of the complexity of the
metabolic network, and the lack of tools to map metabolic alterations in situ. To overcome these challenges, we
developed Compass, a flux balance analysis (FBA) algorithm that applies a network-based analytical approach
to single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to predict metabolic states of individual cells in tissue1. We
have applied Compass as well as standard computational methods to the analysis of longitudinal scRNA-seq
data from a pre-clinical murine model of melanoma with the goal of determining the temporal- and tumor-size-
based metabolic alterations in both tumor and infiltrating immune cells during tumor progression.
Our preliminary data indicate that polyamine metabolism is a key hub of metabolic crosstalk between tumor and
immune cells that are either static or dynamic over the course of melanoma tumor progression and that may
occupy distinct tissue niches. We find that CD4+ regulatory T cells (Treg), exhausted CD8+ T cells, and
suppressive myeloid cells upregulate spermine/spermidine acetyltransferase (Sat1), which catalyzes acetylation
of polyamines, with tumor progression. Conversely, a subset of c-Met+ melanoma cells that has features of
stemness is high for polyamine recycling genes. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that that
systems-based analysis of the alterations and crosstalk involving polyamine metabolism in tumor and
immune cells during tumor progression will uncover novel means for therapeutic intervention. We
propose to: 1) Dissect the functional role of polyamine metabolism in immune cells and tumor cells during tumor
progression; 2) Construct a high resolution spatial map of tumor:immune metabolic crosstalk via the polyamine
pathway."

Chronic liver diseases such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis significantly increase the risk of cirrhosis and
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the underlying mechanisms and genetic alterations that drive HCC
development in chronic liver disease are poorly understood. There is therefore an urgent need to better
understand the fundamental mechanisms how hepatocyte insults predispose to the development of HCC. This
proposal investigates the novel mechanisms that can link alterations in the nuclear envelope to predisposition to
HCC. Lamina-associated polypeptide 1 (LAP1) is an integral protein of the inner nuclear membrane that interacts
with chromatin. We previously showed that depletion of LAP1 from hepatocytes alters hepatic lipid metabolism.
Our new preliminary data demonstrate another unique role for LAP1 in predisposition to HCC. LAP1 undergoes
an isoform switch during cell differentiation and a striking reversal in isoform expression occurs in mouse models
of liver cancer as well as in human HCC. Furthermore, we have shown that depletion of LAP1 from mouse
hepatocytes leads to spontaneous liver tumor formation and activation of fetal genes, including those within a
specific genetic locus linked to tumorigenesis, prior to the appearance of tumors. These results have led us to
hypothesize that LAP1 regulates hepatocyte differentiation and loss of expression of a long isoform and/or
switching to the expression of a small isoform contributes to hepatic neoplasia. In Aim 1, we will test if LAP1
isoform change is a causal factor in driving hepatic neoplasia using diverse mouse models of
hepatocarcinogenesis (Aim 1). We will also examine LAP1 expression in human HCC. In Aim 2, we will test the
hypothesis that LAP1 isoforms have different effects on gene expression via epigenetic regulation by differential
binding to chromatin or chromatin modifier proteins. We will use in vivo and cell culture models of HCC and
examine hepatocyte differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells in which LAP1 isoforms are
selectively expressed. The proposed research will uncover a new link between the nuclear envelope and hepatic
neoplasia and provide insights into potential approaches to prevent or reverse HCC in the setting of chronic liver
disease."
10873785,"One third of B-cell lymphoma patients relapse and remain incurable despite effective targeted
therapies. Although, the serially relapsing nature of these tumors support the presence of stem-
like lymphoma repopulating cells, this notion remains controversial and underexplored.
Resistance to this concept arise from the fact that -in contrast to leukemia or other solid tumors
that originate from stem-like cells- most lymphomas arise from fully differentiated, mature B cells.
However, our preliminary studies provide strong evidence for the existence of rare subpopulations
of B-cells undergoing antigen-activation (in response to pathogens) with stem-like molecular
features and functional properties in a T-cell dependent manner. Moreover, we found that specific
lymphoma-associated mutations further enhance the preexisting stemness program and
potential. We, therefore, hypothesize that a subset of mature B cells is transiently endowed
with stem-like epigenetic features, which are hijacked by specific lymphoma drivers, and
constitute the molecular basis of their increased tumorigenic potential and tumor
repopulating capacity. To address this hypothesis, we have built an interdisciplinary team of
collaborators with expertise in stem cell reprogramming, epigenetics, immunobiology, single-cell
technologies and lymphoma research. We have devised an innovative and bold approach
employing multiple cutting-edge single-cell and chromatin technologies, as well as ex vivo and in
vivo functional assays that will allow us to (i) determine the key regulators that promote or prevent
increased GC B-cell plasticity in normal and cancerous contexts, (ii) decipher the signal and inter-
cellular dependencies that enable emergence of a GC stem-like state and key vulnerabilities and
(iii) dissect the synergies between common lymphoma drivers with GC stem-like properties,
contributing to aggressive disease and relapse. The discovery of B-cell stem-like features and
subpopulations will be paradigm-shifting and have a tremendous impact on the way we
understand and treat lymphomas, opening new avenues for the development of superior
diagnostic and therapeutic strategies."

Modern medicine has created precision drugs blocking a single therapeutic target like TGF-β with high affinity
and specificity. Yet treating lung diseases remains challenging in part because lung microvascular endothelium
represents a key restrictive barrier to effective drug delivery. Current systemic therapeutics rely solely on
convection and diffusion to extravasate passively into the tissue interstitium where disease targets and cells
can readily be reached and directly treated. The goal of this research proposal is to design, develop and test a
novel drug delivery system for immunotherapeutics that overcomes this key barrier by targeting caveolae to
facilitate active and specific transcytosis into lungs after intravenous injection. The ideal is to deliver the entire
therapeutic dose inside the lung tissue with all other tissues minimally exposed. We attempt to approach this
ideal by achieving robust transendothelial pumping precisely into lung tissue to comprehensively block the
therapeutic target TGF-β, which regulates inflammation and remodeling in diseased tissues. Because TGF-β
also exerts various homeostatic effects in many organs, caution is necessary when systemic targeting of its
function is attempted. Precision lung targeting proposed here will maximize efficacy and therapeutic indices by
minimizing dosages, eliminating toxicities, and reducing cost of treatment. To that end, we have genetically
engineered the first “dual precision” immunotherapeutics, namely bispecific antibodies in quad format with one
arm pair mediating precise binding/delivery to and penetration of lung tissue via caveolae pumping and the
other pair constituting the precision therapeutic modality that blocks TGF-β effector function. Active
transendothelial delivery improved precision lung targeting by 100-fold over standard passive transport.
Delivering most of the injected dose into lungs within 1 hour enhanced therapeutic potency by >1000-fold in a
rat pneumonitis model. Now our goal is to expand this promising preliminary work and further improve and
rigorously test this drug delivery system to treat key lung diseases at distinct stages ranging from early acute
inflammation to chronic and progressive fibrosis. We will optimize lung targeting of our dual precision
immunotherapeutics and study their specific lung delivery, penetration, accumulation, localization, and
therapeutic impact in rats using multiple imaging techniques (SPECT-CT, IVM, EM, and IHC). Therapeutic
effects will be assessed in a rat bleomycin model that reproduces pathological hallmarks of many fatal human
diseases including ALI, ARDS, COVID, pneumonias, and fibrosis. Our specific aims are: 1) to engineer and
evaluate distinct caveolae-targeted antibody constructs for precision active delivery into normal lung tissue, 2)
to quantify targeting and optimize delivery of bispecific immunotherapeutics in lung disease, 3) to test efficacy
of bispecific immunotherapeutics to ameliorate lung disease and block TGF-β pathways. This work sets a
foundation for caveolae-targeted therapies and could begin a paradigm shift from passive to active drug
delivery for many diseases."

When looking for a red ladybug in a bush, our attention may be efficiently guided by the red color among the
green leaves. If, instead, finding a green caterpillar is our goal, the same red color would need to be ignored,
and instead a moving leaf should guide our search. Searching for an object involves a complex interplay between
features of the environment that are unique and capture our attention (e.g., the ladybug) and our current task
goals (e.g., look for the movement associated with a green caterpillar). It remains unknown how different brain
regions contribute to the guidance of visual attention based on different types of features of the environment,
and how activation patterns in these brain regions are impacted by our behavioral goals. Our long-term goal is
to understand the principles governing how distributed neural processing systems support flexible visual
cognition. Our overall objective, which is the next step in pursuit of our long-term goal, is to ascertain how top-
down goals and bottom-up stimulus properties jointly mold activation patterns across feature-selective brain
regions. Our central hypothesis is that the core computations supporting attentional selection – bottom-up
enhancement of salient locations and top-down enhancement of relevant locations or stimulus dimensions –
occur at the level of compartmentalized dimension maps instantiated in feature-selective cortical areas, and
these modulations are aggregated into a unified priority map to guide behavior. The rationale for the proposed
research is that, once we establish how attentional selection modulates dimension maps in healthy participants,
we can build improved diagnostic and therapeutic techniques to understand and treat disorders of attentional
control. This hypothesis will be tested across 3 Aims: (1) assay how bottom-up stimulus salience impacts
stimulus representations in dimension maps and priority maps; (2) characterize the independent impact of top-
down attentional selection on activation profiles within dimension maps, and (3) establish the role of neural
dimension maps in guiding attention during visual search tasks. Across all Aims, we will apply model-based
neuroimaging analyses to assay stimulus representations in feature-selective retinotopic brain regions measured
with fMRI. In Aim 1, participants will perform a fixation task while we present different types of stimuli to measure
responses associated with stimulus salience in different features. In Aim 2, participants will selectively attend to
one of several feature values defining a stimulus while we manipulate properties of the stimulus display. In Aim
3, participants will perform a demanding visual search task while we manipulate aspects of the task and stimulus
display. Overall, this project will generate data to determine the role of dimension maps in guiding visual attention.
This project is innovative because it uses model-based neuroimaging analyses to characterize spatial maps
carried by feature-selective brain regions during demanding cognitive behavior, and because it tests a key aspect
of an important theoretical framework. This project is significant because it will lead to a new understanding of
how disparate brain regions collaborate to incorporate stimulus- and task-related factors to guide visual attention."
10904934,"Despite effective LDL-C therapies, cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk remains a major unmet clinical need. We
and others have identified >300 loci for coronary artery disease (CAD). Genes that function in vascular smooth
muscle cells (SMC) are causal at several loci yet the causal genes at most loci remain unknown. Using single
cell profiling and SMC lineage-tracing in mouse models, we found that SMC transition through an intermediate
SMC-derived cell (SDC) state into protective or harmful phenotypes that modulate disease. We hypothesize that
SMC genes play a prominent causal role in plaque instability and CVD risk independent of lipoprotein genes. To
address this, we will leverage unique mouse model and human resources, including the Pakistan Genomics
Resource (PGR, n=250,000 for study) that includes the largest global cohort of human gene knockout “KOs”
(complete KOs >5000; heterozygous KOs >18,000 genes) as well as the Munich Vascular Biobank (MVB) with
>2,000 human plaques and clinical, histology, transcriptomics and genetic data. In Aim 1, we will integrate SMC
lineage tracing in mouse models with analyses of >1 million participants with GWAS SNP, whole-exome (WES)
and whole-genome (WGS) data, eliminating all loci/genes associated with plasma lipoproteins. Implementing
the largest rare variant and gene burden testing for CAD to date, we will prioritize likely causal SMC/SDC genes
and reveal predicted loss of function (pLoF) variant directional effects. To operationalize call-back studies, we
will limit to genes with at least 5 pLoF carriers in PGR. Gene priority will be refined by multiethnic fine-mapping,
co-localization analyses and biological plausibility. We expect to prioritize ~30 SMC/SDC genes. All will undergo
large PheWAS for pleiotropy and safety. For the top 5 genes, call-back studies will validate causality and
directionality and assess safety through deep phenotyping of atherosclerosis traits, safety and pleiotropy markers
in PGR families (n=200 per family). Preliminary work prioritized 15 SMC/SDC genes, all strong causal
candidates, and initial call-back in PGR expanded large pedigrees for the most promising genes (e.g., PDE3A,
SERPINH1, HHIPL1, ZEB2). In Aim 2, we will use RNA in situ sequencing (HybRISS), RNA-scope, proximity
ligation assays (Myh11-H3K4me2 SMC/SDC mark) and histology to define SMC/SDC gene expression and
location for ~30 prioritized genes in stable vs. unstable MVB plaques. Change in allele specific expression for
genes in SDC types in stable vs. unstable MVB plaques and co-localization of their cis-eQTLs to CAD SNPs will
inform causal and directional effects on plaque stability. For at least 2 top genes, we will use a Tet-on Dre/Cre
dual inducible recombinase system for SMC gene deletion at late time points to test effects and mechanisms on
features of plaque stability in advanced lesions and disease regression. We are poised to test in mouse models
if PDE3A, one compelling example, promotes SMC proliferation, senescence and vascular remodeling. Overall,
we propose a unique integrative platform, validated by human genetics, to fine-map loci, discover causal genes
and elucidate safe therapeutic targets in SMC/SDCs causal pathways for atherosclerosis stability and CVD risk."

Dr. Rubin is a neurointensivist and computational neuroscientist working at Massachusetts General Hospital
whose goal is to become an independent physician investigator with expertise in the development of novel
neurotechnologies to improve the lives of people living with the symptoms of disabling neurologic disease and
injury. His career development plan leverages the resources of a world-class training environment and brings
together experts in neural decoding, systems and circuit neuroscience, and neural engineering in proposing a
cutting-edge approach to the study of the neural basis of speech generation to enable the next generation of
high-performance intracortical brain computer interfaces (iBCI) for communication.
Under the mentorship of Drs. Leigh Hochberg and Sydney Cash and with the guidance of scientific advisors Drs.
Emery Brown, Jaimie Henderson, and Kristina Simonyan, Dr. Rubin proposes to (1) determine the features of
the neural code in motor cortex specific to the production of individual spoken words, (2) characterize the
influence of semantic and non-semantic context on the neural representation of intended speech, and (3) identify
the operations translating neural representations of language in association cortex into the patterns of neural
activity in motor cortex that coordinate the production of speech. Each of these aims will require the development
and application of novel computational tools, bringing together recent advancements in fields of single unit and
circuit-level neurophysiology, systems and computational neuroscience, machine learning, and natural language
processing. The overall goal of this project is to elucidate key features of the neurophysiologic basis of speech

of an iBCI able to decode in real time a user’s intended or attempted speech. In doing so, this work is poised to
transform the lives of hundreds of thousands of people living deficits in communication due to neurologic injury

project will also generate new insights into the neurophysiologic basis of a uniquely human behavior,
representing a potentially major neuroscientific advancement. In the long term, Dr. Rubin’s career goal is to
develop novel neurotechnology aimed alleviating the symptoms of and augmenting recovery from neurologic

10848496,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The choroid plexus (ChP) protrudes into the lumen of the four cerebral ventricles and is the principal source of
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which together play an important role in neuronal patterning, brain physiology,
buoyancy, and maintaining homeostasis by providing physical, enzymatic, and immunological barriers to the
brain. Neuroimaging studies have observed ChP morphological changes with aging, neurodevelopmental and
neuropsychiatric disorders, which suggests that the ChP may play a role in development and brain disorders.
Despite this growing evidence, the ChP has not been the focus of commonly used neuroimaging tools, which
causes it to be poorly segmented, mislabeled, and incorrectly quantified. Therefore, there is a critical need to
more accurately segment the ChP. The overall objectives for this project are to develop a novel, fast, reliable,
generalizable, and dedicated open-source deep learning method for accurate ChP segmentation to understand
how the ChP changes across the lifespan and differs among brain disorders. Samples for this study will come
from high resolution [Human Connectome Project (HCP) and Connectome Related Human Disease (CRHD)]
and conventional (inclusive of high risk for psychosis, first episode and chronic psychosis, bipolar disorder, and
Alzheimer’s disease) neuroimaging datasets totaling over 22,000 brains. The rationale for the proposed research
is to provide an open-source segmentation tool that will allow for more robust analyses into the ChP’s role in
various brain disorders and a better foundational understanding of the how the ChP changes over time with age.
To attain the overall objectives, the following three specific aims are proposed: (1) develop and validate a deep-
learning method for the accurate segmentation of the ChP; (2) generate ChP volume data across the lifespan
that can be used to characterize longitudinal changes and morphological differences across a variety of
neuropsychiatric disorders; (3) establish reliability, generalizability, and fairness for broad distribution of
FastPlex. To accomplish these aims, a total of 700 brains will be manually segmented – accounting for scanner
type and image resolution that is balanced for age, sex, ethnicity/race, socioeconomic status, and brain disorder
– to serve as training, validation, and testing labels for the deep-learning tool. Lasty, reliability and generalizability
will be established to produce a tool that will be broadly distributed with the research community. The proposed
research is innovative and significant because it will focus on an innovative comprehensive ChP segmentation
tool (lateral, temporal horn, 3rd, and 4th ventricles) that also estimates partial volume effects and provides super
resolution ChP labels, which together will enhance foundational knowledge on ChP neurodevelopmental and
neuropsychiatric changes. The results of this research are expected to contribute meaningfully to the
understanding of pathologic mechanisms underlying these disorders and to the development of novel strategies
targeting specific disease processes."

People with opioid use disorder are often forced to undergo withdrawal during incarceration due to lack of
opioid treatment in custody, contributing to their elevated risk of drug overdose and other negative health
outcomes in the weeks after release. Providing access to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) in
correctional settings is a promising strategy to reduce overdose risk, but jails have not widely adopted this
strategy. Achieving maximal public health benefits will require that MOUD programs are adopted across local
jails that vary substantially in their resources and capacity, that benefits diffuse widely across racial/ethnic
groups, and that jails ensure transition to treatment providers in the surrounding community after release. In
2019, the Maryland legislature passed the first U.S. law requiring all local jails in the state to provide all forms
of MOUD and create linkages to care after release. The legislation created a phased implementation of the
program starting in 2020. The staggered implementation presents a natural experiment to evaluate how the
implementation of the programs in jails affect a variety of post-incarceration outcomes overall, and across
different facilities and local environments. We propose a mixed-methods evaluation of the Maryland law. Aims
1 and 2 will analyze a data warehouse that links statewide correctional records, hospital, prescription
monitoring program, behavioral health, and medical examiner data. Aim 1 will consider overall impacts of
exposure to the jail MOUD program using non-experimental methods that compare changes in post-release
outcome before and after jails implement the program. Aim 1B will use implementation measures reported to
the state to assess whether outcomes differ in jails with high versus low levels of implementation based on
monthly reports of program participation. Aim 2 will examine racial/ethnic disparities in the impact of the policy,
and assess the contribution of variables at the individual, jail, and community level (e.g., social stressors,
access to treatment) on inequitable outcomes. We hypothesize that overdose and other hospitalizations will
decrease and MOUD use will improve among individuals leaving facilities with MOUD programs. We also
hypothesize that impacts will be strongest for people treated at programs with high (versus low) levels of
implementation. We hypothesize that people from minoritized backgrounds will not gain as much from the
policy as non-Hispanic white people due to pervasive inequities in access to resources in jails and post-
release. Aim 3 will provide complementary implementation evidence focusing on 8 jails. We will conduct in-
depth, semi-structured interviews with 40 program leaders (e.g., jail staff, community providers) and 40
formerly incarcerated individuals to explore barriers and facilitators to providing MOUD in jail and post-release.
Together, study Aims will provide new evidence about how statewide jail initiatives may increase MOUD and
improve health among people leaving jails. This information can guide future efforts in jails in Maryland and
other states as they adopt MOUD treatment programs and adapt these programs to their local environments."

Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are unique in that they retain their ability to indefinitely self-renew
while maintaining the capacity to self-organize and differentiate into both embryonic and extraembryonic
lineages. iPSCs have emerged as a powerful tool to study human development, and disease, and have been
integrated with tissue engineering approaches for regenerative medicine applications. To fulfill the promise of
iPSC clinical utility, further investigation of the role of the stem cell niche in iPSC morphogenesis, lineage
specification, and functional maturation is needed. While organoid approaches have revolutionized our ability to
mimic organ-level function in a dish, they typically are comprised of cells from a single germ layer, missing critical
cues shared by surrounding populations including the microvasculature and stroma. In addition, organoids are
generated in ill-defined matrices such as Matrigel, which suffers from batch-to-batch variation, and limited
tunability. To this end, we propose using micropatterned induced gastrulation models to better understand how
paracrine and mechanical cues guide primitive stem cell fate. In addition, by leveraging assembloid technologies,
synthetic extracellular matrix mimics, and dynamic microfluidic culture, we aim to better understand multi-germ
layer interactions during tissue specification. Finally, we propose that improved iPSC derivatives can be used
to better understand patient-specific differences in metabolic disorders. Collectively, we propose that using an
integrative approach will permit iPSCs to be a powerful testbed for studying developmental biology and disease
processes."

Hearing loss is among the leading causes of disability worldwide, with the highest burden in resource limited

children is due to preventable factors, and identification is the first step in addressing hearing loss. High income
countries have implemented universal newborn hearing screening (UNHS) programs with a goal of diagnosing
hearing loss and starting early intervention in the first few months of life. Few comparable programs exist in low
and middle income countries, given such barriers as limited access to trained personnel and high cost of hearing
screening equipment.
We propose to optimize a low-cost smartphone otoacoustic emissions (OAE) device for hearing screening and
study the implementation in an RLS. The smartphone OAE is comparable to conventional hearing screening
equipment in US trials and now must be evaluated where it can have the greatest impact. The aims of the R21
are to optimize the OAE device in various clinical settings and patient ages in Kenya. We will evaluate potential
impact of noisy clinical environments, assess consistency of screening, and compare usability in frontline and
lay health facility workers, with a deliverable of a low-cost, user-friendly OAE that is a feasible tool in a low-
resource clinical setting. Work will begin to integrate hearing screening results from the smartphone OAE directly
with electronic medical records systems in Kenya. The R33 will further establish implementation outcomes and
validity of the smartphone OAE device in a UNHS program, and will provide an in-depth evaluation of the
implementation strategy and task-shifting in the Kenyan context. In parallel, the R33 will deploy the smartphone
OAE in a longitudinal study of suspected (HIV exposure) and known (otitis media with effusion) risk factors for
hearing loss. The longitudinal study will leverage an additional innovative lay-person friendly smartphone tool
that can be used to monitor for middle ear fluid, an important companion for hearing screening in children that
typically relies on expensive, skill intensive equipment. The research team includes medical providers, public
health researchers, computer scientists and the Technical Working Group for Ear and Hearing Care in Kenya’s
Ministry of Health, a collaboration that will support program sustainability when the project is complete. The
project establishes a foundation for smartphone OAE in UNHS programs, high-risk infant surveillance, ototoxicity
monitoring, and future research to understand and improve ear and hearing care in RLS. The outcomes of this
work align with the goals of the WHO World Report on Hearing, which strives for all people, including those with
hearing loss, to have access to high-quality services without experiencing financial hardship by 2030."

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a family of chronic disorders of the intestine afflicting nearly
3 million Americans. Consisting of Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), IBD is
significantly increasing in severity and prevalence worldwide and represents a disease with one
of the highest hospitalization rates among American veterans. Incidence of IBD among military
service members is estimated to be 2-10 times greater than non-service members, with a
striking relationship between IBD incidence and the number of life stressors.
It is notable that the pathogenesis of IBD is incompletely understood. Ongoing work by us and
labs around the world suggests that imbalances in the gut microbiome (termed dysbiosis) in
combination with abnormal mucosal innate immunity play central roles in in the pathogenesis of
IBD. It is also clear that ongoing inflammatory responses are associated with profound shifts in
tissue metabolism that fundamentally influence barrier function and wound healing. These
studies have strongly implicated a loss of energy balance (i.e., “starved gut”) as a driving force
in the pathogenesis of IBD. Our ongoing studies are utilizing multi-disciplinary approaches to
identify molecular targets to bolster energy metabolism and promote inflammatory resolution in
mucosal inflammation. We hope to translate this fundamental research into the development of
novel therapeutics for veterans.
The research described in this Research Career Scientist Award proposal is highly collaborative
in nature, involving scientific interactions with multiple investigators at the Rocky Mountain
Regional Veterans Affairs Medical Center as well as investigators at the San Diego Regional VA
Medical Center. I plan to continue fostering and expanding these productive collaborations. The
Rocky Mountain Regional VA Medical Center and the Denver metro area provides a fertile
training ground for biomedical research Training of junior faculty, graduate students and
postdoctoral fellows are essential components of this Research Career Scientist Award. We will
continue building the infrastructure and mentoring environment to attract CDA2 candidates, and
thus help train the next generation of outstanding VA scientists."

Overweight/obesity (OW/OB) affects 14 million adolescents in the United States, disproportionately affecting
girls and racial/ethnic minorities, increasing their risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Behavioral
weight loss interventions are the foundation of obesity treatment modalities, yet many have led to limited
weight loss and weight regain is common. Limited success in adolescent weight loss interventions may be
attributed primarily to adolescents’ lack of self-regulation skills, which are essential for adhering to diet and
physical activity goals. There is a critical need for development of interventions that teach self-regulation skills
to adolescents in order to adapt to pervasive biological and environmental cues that are often experienced
during weight loss. An innovative behavioral treatment, acceptance-based therapy (ABT), focuses on self-
regulation skills and increasing mindfulness and tolerance of negative or uncomfortable emotions. ABT has
demonstrated strong evidence as an effective weight loss strategy in adults. Our group utilized an adolescent-
engaged approach to develop, implement, and test the feasibility and acceptability of an ABT weight loss
intervention for adolescent girls with OW/OB. The feasibility study was a 6-month ABT behavioral weight loss
intervention comprised of 15 in-person group sessions (90-minutes each) over a 6-month period led by an
instructor trained in ABT. The feasibility study demonstrated strong acceptability among adolescent girls with
OW/OB. The objective of this study, called the Wellness Achieved Through Changing Habits (WATCH) trial, is
to test the efficacy of an ABT intervention versus an enhanced care (EC) intervention on markers of
cardiometabolic health, health related behaviors, and psychological factors. During the R61 phase (year one),
we will finalize all WATCH policies and procedures including clinical trials registration, manual of operations,
IRB approvals, convening the DSMB board, and begin recruitment. We will also submit a NIH progress report
on participant recruitment, demographics, and intervention fidelity. During the R33 phase (years 2-5), we
propose a randomized controlled trial of 148 adolescent girls (≥40% racial/ethnic minorities) with OW/OB to
test the hypothesis that those randomized to ABT (vs. EC) will have significantly decreased BMI z-score
(primary outcome) and body fat, and improved blood pressure and blood lipids at post-treatment, 6-month
follow-up, and 12-month follow-up. We also hypothesize that relative to EC intervention, ABT will significantly
improve health-related behaviors and psychological factors. As an exploratory aim, we will examine the extent
to which ABT’s effects on weight and body composition are mediated by improvements in behavioral and
psychological factors, and identify key moderators of ABT intervention effects including baseline demographic
and psychological factors. This study will yield a novel, obesity intervention tailored to the needs of adolescents
with OW/OB by developing self-regulation skills and providing tools to promote cardiometabolic health."
10931626,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
In the US, nearly half of all pregnancies are unintended. Unintended pregnancies are associated with risks to
maternal and child health including late prenatal care, premature delivery, developmental delay, and family
instability. Governmental agencies and professional maternal and child health organizations support access to
contraceptive use and family planning services as essential for women’s health. However, some communities
face structural barriers to contraceptive access. The Latinx immigrant community in the US is growing and over
half of all US-born Latinx children live with at least one immigrant parent. Latinx immigrants have a limited path
to legal status in the US, limiting preventive health care access. With the growing number of US-born children
living in immigrant families and the limited options for Latinas to access contraceptive care, the pediatric setting
is an unexplored venue for interventions that increase contraceptive access for Latina immigrants. However, to
be effective, contraceptive access interventions must be person-centered and acknowledge the historical
burdens of structural racism on contraceptive access for communities of color. In this K23 application, Dr
Caballero, a research-trained pediatrician, proposes a rigorous training and research plan that will facilitate her
long-term career goal: to strengthen child and family health by developing and implementing person-centered
interventions to improve contraceptive access equity for immigrants. She proposes to: 1) develop expertise in
qualitative methods and analysis to inform implementation-focused outcomes; 2) develop skills in human
factors engineering principles and implementation science; 3) learn and apply family planning demography
principles to intervention design and analysis; and 4) develop a deeper understanding of contraceptive and
reproductive oppression in the US and how to apply health equity principles to advance equitable sexual and
reproductive health interventions. She also proposes innovative mentored research to develop and pilot a
contraceptive screening and care coordination intervention (Conecta/Conect) in a pediatric primary care setting
that serves a large proportion of immigrant families. Conecta will be stakeholder-informed and rooted in human
factors engineering approaches to health care redesign. This study will provide preliminary data to support a
future larger trial of Conecta. Dr. Caballero’s research will occur in a supportive, collaborative environment at
Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, under the guidance of an experienced and dedicated multidisciplinary
mentoring team. This team is committed to supporting Dr. Caballero in achieving her research and training
goals and her long-term goal of becoming a highly productive independent clinician-investigator and leader in
pediatric-focused interventions to improve contraceptive access equity that uniquely address the needs of
immigrant families."
10741773,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Our premise is that the fetal stage of human brain development is the most dynamic, the most vulnerable and
the most important for lifelong behavioral and cognitive function. As many neurological disorders have their
genesis in fetal life, there is a need to accurately quantify normal and abnormal fetal brain development from
both the perspective of fetal brain structure and body motion. Better imaging tools would enable us to explore
how fetal neurological disorders as well as environmental exposures, such as opioids, maternal obesity, or
COVID-19, impact early brain structure and body movements. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2-weighted,
single-shot fast-spin-echo (e.g. HASTE) images provide a unique window into this critical phase of structural
brain development, with the potential to detect subtle abnormalities. However, fetal brain MRI is challenging due
to fetal motion, which leads to image artifacts, double oblique acquisitions and incomplete brain coverage. As a
result, trained MR technologists must “chase the fetus” to amass the necessary images to diagnose the presence
or absence of lesions, resulting in long scan times and higher RF energy deposition. Thus, fetal brain MRI is
inefficient, limited to specialized centers, and diagnosis is still difficult because fetal motion results in each image
being an independent slice that cannot be referenced to another slice, making confirmation of suspicious findings
difficult. At the same time, fetal motion is an important measure of functional neurological integrity, informing
postnatal outcomes. However, current clinical MR and ultrasound assessments of fetal motion do not fully
capture the complex 3D motions of all body parts simultaneously. Better assessment of fetal neurological health
requires novel tools to automatically and efficiently obtain coherent, high quality HASTE fetal brain volumes and
to characterize 3D fetal whole-body motion. To address these unmet needs, we will leverage convolutional neural
network (CNN) models and propose the following aims: (1) Develop a self-driving engine for efficient acquisition
of high-quality HASTE fetal brain volumes and (2) Enable automated fetal whole-body motion tracking and
characterization. We will deploy the proposed tools in a prospective study that compares fetuses with Chiari II
malformation (spina bifida), a disorder known to have brain abnormalities and often associated with decreased
leg movement, to typical fetuses with the following aim: (3) Assess performance of the self-driving HASTE engine
and whole-body motion characterization in Chiari II vs typical fetuses. For Aims 1 and 2, we will include data
from collaborating sites and strategies for CNN generalization to increase robustness and potential to deploy our
tools to other scanners. The ability to automatically obtain high-quality coherent fetal brain volumes and
characterize fetal motion will improve stratification for fetal treatments and characterization of response to fetal
interventions. Success will also enable sites without fetal imaging experts to locally assess and triage fetuses
with suspected abnormalities to specialized treatment centers, as well as facilitate large population-based
studies to understand the impact of environmental influences on early brain development and fetal behavior."
10741774,"This MPI proposal has the overarching theme that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake plays dual “ying-yang”
roles when the heart is under stress: it ensures that extra energy demands are met under workload stress,
while it is the route for Ca2+ overload/toxicity under oxidative stress. The project uses a new conditional knock-
out rat model for EMRE/Smdt1, an essential subunit of the main mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake system, the mito-
chondrial Ca2+ uniporter channel complex (MCUC). The excitation-bioenergetics (EB) coupling is a signaling
loop that uses the Ca2+ released by sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) to activate MCUC and generate mitochon-
drial matrix Ca2+ signals to upregulate ATP production. Our long-term goal is to translate the fundamental
mechanism of EB coupling to health and disease of the heart. Our previous work demonstrated that MCUC is
recruited to hotspots at the mitochondria-SR (Mito-SR) contacts to effectively mediate EB coupling by a yet
unknown mechanism.
 This proposal aims to address the following gaps in our knowledge about EB coupling:
i). The role of MCUC in cardiac stress tolerance, diastolic dysfunction and heart failure with preserved ejection
fraction (HFpEF). ii). Molecular mechanisms, protein-protein interactions of MCUC recruitment to hotspots at
Mito-SR contacts. iii). How are organelle dynamics (contact formation, fusion/fission) integrated with the dy-
namics of Ca2+ transport distribution? iv). The role of a dominant negative subunit MCUB in the MCUC hotspot
formation, control of the inactive and activatable MCUC channel pool distribution to attain balance between EB
coupling and Ca2+ toxicity.
 The Central Hypothesis is that the dichotomy of mitochondrial Ca2+ in controlling health and disease of
cardiomyocytes hinges on the crucial role of EMRE and MCUB in regulating the location and quantity of func-
tional MCUC; this elaborate regulation is critical in cardiac adaptation to “fight or flight” and oxidative stress re-
sponses. Three specific aims are set up to test this hypothesis:
Aim 1. Assess the regulation of EB coupling by MCUC during “fight or flight” sympathetic stress and determine
if cessation of this function could lead to diastolic dysfunction or HFpEF.
Aim 2. Elucidate the molecular mechanism of the MCUC hotspot recruitment in the rat cardiomyocytes.
Aim 3. Study the dynamic interactions between EMRE, MCU and MCUB in regulating the MCUC localization
to maintain EB coupling efficiency while preventing Ca2+ toxicity under pathological stresses.
 Completion of the proposed studies will generate a new paradigm for the regulatory mechanisms of mi-
tochondrial Ca2+ in cardiac energetics. The new findings will provide mechanistic basis for a new therapeutic
strategy to treat heart failure."

The overarching goal of this project is to develop the principal investigator (PI) into an independent clinician-
scientist contributing to the field of ocular autoimmunity. The PI has obtained his PhD in neuroscience, exploring
the roles of the adaptive immune system in axonal injury models. He has additional clinical training in
ophthalmology and subspecialty training in uveitis and ocular immunology, which forms the basis for his medical
practice in the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis. The
five-year career development plan outlined here will utilize a combination of didactic courses, individualized
training from expert collaborators, and mentorship from established investigators to enhance his knowledge
base, to learn new experimental models he can continue to use in his career, and to define the research
questions on which he will base the start of his independent research program. By the end of this program, he
will have acquired the skills necessary to become an independent investigator.
His primary mentor is Rajendra Apte, MD PhD, an R01-funded investigator who has a longitudinal track record
of training early-stage investigators that have gone on to productive independent careers. He is a preeminent
scholar in the field of choroidal immunity and has a strong background as a clinician scientist that will be vital for
helping the PI navigate the challenges involved in transitioning to an independent lab. Dr. Apte will be supported
by Rachel Caspi, PhD, the world-leading expert in experimental autoimmune uveitis, Jonathan Kipnis, PhD, the
foremost expert in the adaptive immune system in border tissues, and Gregory Wu, MD PhD, a recent K08
awardee and expert on CNS autoimmunity. The PI will take advantage of his mentorship committee and the
vibrant scientific environment of Washington University, one of the world’s premiere medical research
institutions, to develop the unexplored topic of the adaptive immune response in the choroid.
Uveitis is one of the leading causes of preventable blindness, and while much work has gone in to evaluating
the effects of T cell-derived cytokines, there is a significant gap in understanding of the anatomy of the immune
response including where the adaptive immune system interfaces with ocular antigens. This deficit has led to
toxic and often ineffective systemic therapies as the mainstay of treatment. We show that intraocular antigens
are taken up in the choroid, a tissue that has a rich adaptive immune presence. In autoimmune uveitis there is
an increase of CD4+ T cells in the choroid, indicating that the choroid plays a vital role as the immune interface
between the intraocular space and adaptive immune system. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that
the adaptive immune system is activated by retinal antigens in the choroid and that this interaction plays a central
role in uveitis. We will further elucidate the mechanisms contributing to immune surveillance in the choroid.
Understanding the mechanisms behind this process has broad implications in the development of diagnostic
testing and targeted therapy that will improve the clinical outcomes in uveitis."

In Nepal, the prevalence of HTN among adults is 25% is similar to the global prevalence. In Nepal, however, a
comparatively larger proportion of adults (44%) are unaware of their HTN status, 33% of HTN patients are
receiving treatment, and only 12% of the patients have their BP under control. Despite the availability of proven
effective lifestyle changes and low-cost anti-HTN treatment in preventing major vascular events and total
mortality, these recommendations have not been translated into practice. In Nepal, the Package of Essential
Non Communicable Diseases (PEN) was adopted that
includes
protocols to detect and manage HTN at the
basic health facilities However, major implementation barriers at multiple levels exists: (a) Individual level: low
perceived susceptibility, low health literacy, misconceptions; (b) Interpersonal level: peer pressure; (c)
Community level: norms supporting unhealthy eating and low medication adherence; and (d) Organizational
level: unfilled human resource positions, overburdened health staff, interrupted medical supplies and
medicines; inefficient recording and reporting, and inadequate provider-patient interaction. In response to these
multi-level implementation barriers, we propose to implement and evaluate a new task-shifting strategy to
community health workers (CHW), leading to improved HTN prevention and control. CHWs will : (a) engage
with and educate clients more frequently, for longer periods, and in their homes, hence building clients' self-
efficacy; (b) improve health system efficiency by providing quality provider-client time to modify lifestyle,
monitor blood pressure; and (c) CHWs will directly connect the HTN patients with health care providers at
health facilities through time referral. We will conduct a type III hybrid effectiveness-implementation study to
implement and evaluate a CHW led HTN prevention and control (CHPC) implementation strategy to deliver
increased uptake and sustainment of healthy diet, physical activity, and antihypertensive medication use;
leading to lowering of blood pressure.Aim 1 will assessimplementation outcomes of CHPC implementation
strategy using the RE-AIM framework at the patient, provider and health system levels. We will utilize mixed
methods to measure the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance outcomes for
sustained implementation of CHPC. Aim 2 will assess the effectiveness of the CHPC implementation strategy
compared to facility-based PEN on systolic BP via a cluster randomized controlled trial. We will recruit 2432
participants with high blood pressure in 171 geographic clusters randomized to assess CHPC on systolic BP
(primary outcome). Aim 3 will evaluate the economic sustainability of CHPC. We will collect primary cost data
from facilities and participants and use the effectiveness estimate from aim 2 to model the costs and cost-
effectiveness and household out of pocket expenditure impacts. If successful, this study will provide the
governments of Nepal and other LMICs a HTN prevention and control strategy to mitigate the burden of HTN in
low resource settings."

Treatments for chronic wounds incur a substantial healthcare burden, but are largely ineffective. In addition,
prolonged skin barrier defects in chronic wounds can cause infection or develop into even more severe diseases
such as cancer. Therefore, there is a critical need to understand the mechanisms involved in the recovery of the
skin barrier during wound repair to develop effective treatments and prevent progression of disease. The skin
epidermis (i.e., outermost layers of skin) serves as a barrier to our body and is composed of different types of
cells: epithelial cells in the stratified epithelium of the epidermis act as a physical barrier, and a network of skin-
resident immune cells, Langerhans cells (LCs), act as an immunological barrier. LCs surveil the skin surface as
immune sentinels and can induce both immunity and tolerance. Although immunological functions of LCs have
been thoroughly investigated, and other immune cells (e.g., macrophages and neutrophils) are known to play a
role in skin regeneration, little is known about the role of LCs in skin regeneration. Our long-term goal is to
understand the fundamental mechanisms that regulate skin regeneration and repair. The objective of this
proposal is to gain a deeper understanding of LC-epithelial cell interactions that restore an intact skin barrier in
live mammals. This will inform and advance new therapeutic strategies for acute and chronic wound repair. We
will test how LCs behave with epithelial cells during re-epithelization and rebuild a damaged network de novo in
live mice using our intravital imaging system. Upon completion of this project, we will understand how LCs, in
conjunction with neighboring epithelial cells, contribute to skin regeneration during wound repair. Our work
suggests that LC and epithelial cells communicate with each other to maintain epidermal homeostasis.
Remarkably, activated LCs near the wound show distinct transcriptomic signatures that can regulate the
behaviors of epithelial cells. We recently observed that activated LCs near the wound migrate with epithelial cells
during re-epithelization. These LCs eventually migrate to the wounded area and contribute to the recovery of the
LC network with monocyte-derived LCs. This finding led us to hypothesize that communication between activated
LCs and epithelial cells in the injured epidermis is essential for re-epithelization and recovery of the LC network.
To address this hypothesis, we will determine how LCs regulate epithelial behaviors that impact re-epithelization.
Next, we will test how the interactions between LCs and epithelial cells affect the mobility and surveillance of
LCs during re-epithelization. Finally, we will elucidate how LCs of different origins cooperatively reestablish new
LC networks within the wounded area to restore an intact immune barrier of the skin. The insights from our
proposed work will provide the foundations to harness the power of LCs in regenerative medicine for treating
chronic wounds."
10916448,"Nearly 2 million persons aged 65 years or older are admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) each year; of those
who survive, half will not achieve functional recovery over the subsequent months. To date, prior post-ICU in-
terventions targeting functional outcomes have not been successful; moreover, no prior post-ICU interventions
targeting functional recovery have focused on older adults, who are more vulnerable to poor functional out-
comes than their younger counterparts. Our long-term goal is to develop interventions to improve functional
outcomes among older ICU survivors. Our preliminary data suggest that unmet needs across four domains
(home environment, skilled rehabilitation, hearing and vision, and informal and formal care) may adversely af-
fect functional recovery among older adults who have returned home (either directly or after short-term rehab
[STR]) after an ICU hospitalization. The overall objective of this application is to elucidate the unmet needs of
older ICU survivors, evaluate the association of these unmet needs with disability, hospital readmissions, and
mortality over the subsequent 6 months, and assess barriers and facilitators to addressing these unmet needs.
The central hypothesis is that older ICU survivors have unmet needs in the aforementioned domains that rep-
resent potential targets for intervention, and that these unmet needs are associated with disability burden, hos-
pital readmissions, and mortality. The rationale for the proposed research is that this work will directly inform
the development of an intervention to address unmet needs and facilitate functional recovery among older ICU
survivors. The central hypothesis will be tested by enrolling a new cohort of older ICU survivors to achieve the
following specific aims: 1) To identify unmet needs in multiple domains after return home from an ICU hospitali-
zation, evaluate whether these unmet needs are associated with disability burden in the subsequent 6 months,
and ascertain whether these associations are moderated by initial discharge destination (home or STR); the
domains include: the home environment, skilled rehabilitation services, sensory needs (in hearing and vision),
and informal (unpaid) care and formal (paid) home care services; 2) To evaluate the association of unmet
needs in these multiple domains with hospital readmissions and mortality over the subsequent 6 months; and
3) Through qualitative interviews with a subset of older ICU survivors (and their caregivers, if applicable), to
explore barriers to addressing unmet needs and to gather patient and caregiver input about facilitators in ad-
dressing unmet needs to inform a future intervention. The proposed research is innovative because it will use a
geriatrics lens to rigorously evaluate unmet needs across multiple domains, which in turn will directly inform the
development of a future intervention to facilitate functional recovery among older ICU survivors by addressing
these unmet needs. The research proposed in this application will provide a strong evidence base for actiona-
ble targets to reduce disability, hospital readmissions, and mortality among older adults who have survived a
critical illness, in line with NIA’s strategic priorities."
10913605,"Project Abstract/Summary
The rising prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes threatens to limit human healthspan by increasing the
risks for cancer and cardiometabolic disease and to impose overwhelming economic burdens. New
therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Since the discovery of functional brown and beige adipocytes in
adult humans, much attention has focused on exploiting the ability of these thermogenic adipocytes to
dissipate excess energy as heat through uncoupled mitochondrial respiration. Advanced imaging in humans
has revealed a favorable correlation between brown fat mass and cardiometabolic risk factors. A major gap
in the field is a safe and effective pharmacological strategy to activate brown and/or beige adipocytes to
promote negative energy balance, reverse obesity, and mitigate obesity-related metabolic disorders, such
type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The overall goal of this
application is to provide proof-of-concept for one such strategy that has been suggested by the lab’s long-
standing research program on Perilipin 5 (PLIN5), a member of the Perilipin family of lipid droplet proteins
that is expressed in oxidative tissues, including brown adipose tissue (BAT). A growing body of literature
from our lab and others has implicated PLIN5 not only in the regulation of lipolysis at the lipid droplet
surface, but also in the regulation of gene expression via interactions in the nucleus with SIRT1 and PGC1a
and in the tethering of lipid droplets to mitochondria. Our published work in mice has shown that PLIN5 is
required for the metabolic, transcriptional, and mitochondrial adaptations of BAT to cold stress. We have
also shown that PLIN5 gain-of-function in BAT of mice can prevent glucose intolerance and fatty liver from
high-fat diet and promote healthy remodeling of white adipose tissue (WAT) with prevention of adipocyte
hypertrophy. In this renewal application we propose to test the hypothesis that promoting PLIN5 expression
in BAT in conjunction with b3 adrenergic receptor agonist treatment of diet-induced obese mice will reverse
adipocyte hypertrophy in WAT, reverse obesity, and reverse glucose intolerance. Aim 1 will elucidate the
metabolic and signaling pathways responsible for the effects of PLIN5 on mitochondrial form and function in
BAT and on systemic lipid and glucose metabolism by means of genetic mouse models, in vivo structure-
function studies, and mechanistic mitochondrial experiments. Aim 2 will interrogate the signaling pathways
and physiological responses associated with treatment of diet-induced obesity with a 2-hit intervention built
on augmentation of PLIN5 in BAT in synergistic combination with b3 adrenergic receptor agonist treatment.
Successful completion of these Aims may establish the conceptual foundation for a new therapeutic
paradigm for treatment of obesity that is efficacious but at lower, non-toxic doses of existing medications."

In a recent study published in Nature Nanotechnology, we demonstrated that cancer cells form physical
nanoscales tentacles (nanotubes) to connect with and harvest mitochondria from immune cells. Such
mitochondria hijacking metabolically depleted the immune cells and augmented the cancer cells. These
findings have significant implications as it emerges as a novel mechanism of immune evasion by cancer
cells, which can limit the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Here we propose to develop next-
generation immunotherapies that can perturb this novel immune evasion phenomenon. We are specifically
developing novel small molecule inhibitors of the exocyst complex, which we have implicated in the above
phenomenon. Our preliminary results show that such small molecules can exert a powerful antitumor
efficacy, augment classical immune checkpoint inhibitors and display an excellent safety profile. In Aim 1.
We will synthesize and characterize exocyst inhibitors in vitro to test the hypothesis that rationally designed
small molecule inhibitors of the exocyst complex can inhibit nanotube assembly. In Aim. 2. We will establish
the safety pharmacology of exocyst inhibitors in vivo. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that exocyst
inhibitors can improve antitumor outcomes with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Achieving these aims will lead
to fundamental insights into a new mechanism of cancer-immune cell communication. Our preliminary
results indicate exocyst inhibitors can emerge as a new class of immunotherapy."

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a human neurodevelopmental condition that features deficits in
affiliation/attachment behavior and early life sleep. Prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) are a wild rodent
species that are an ideal animal model in which to study affiliation/attachment (an RDoC domain), since unlike
traditional lab rats and mice, they display strong affiliation with opposite-sex mates. Variation in medial
prefrontal cortex (mPFC) structure predicts differences in affiliation/attachment behavior, both across and
within vole species. Additionally, the mPFC-NAcc (nucleus accumbens) network is both necessary and
sufficient for social bond formation in prairie voles. Moreover, mPFC and mPFC-NAcc have been implicated in
both ASD1,2 and neurotypical human attachment. However, exactly how mPFC-NAcc network dysregulation
occurs during the course of brain development, and what form this takes at the cellular level, is still unknown.
Due to the late maturation of the mPFC, affiliation/attachment may be particularly vulnerable to postnatal
events such as sleep disruption and we reported that early life sleep disruption (ELSD) in prairie vole pups in
the 3rd postnatal week led to a combination of reduced affiliation/attachment later in life and increases in mPFC
dendritic spines. This mirrors the combination of early-life sleep disruption, mPFC network changes, and
reductions in affiliation/attachment behavior in humans with ASD. However, despite our recent findings, two
major knowledge gaps remain: 1) How ELSD affects the longitudinal development of affiliation/attachment, and
how early changes may predict adult phenotypes, and 2) How the mPFC network functional state is altered,
with a specific knowledge gap related to effects on E/I balance. We hypothesize that the mPFC changes in
ELSD will result in alterations in both the developmental trajectory of affiliation/attachment and mPFC
electrophysiological activity, and ELSD-induced social deficits will be rescued by optogenetic stimulation of
mPFC-NAcc projections at theta frequencies. We will test these hypotheses by pursuing 3 aims: Aim 1:
Determine effects of early life sleep disruption (ELSD) on the longitudinal development of affiliation/attachment
using continuous, high-resolution, high-throughput behavioral phenotyping. Aim 2: Determine the effects of
ELSD on mPFC electrophysiological state during affiliation/ attachment behaviors. Aim 3: Manipulate mPFC to
NAcc projection activity to rescue ELSD-induced deficits in affiliation/ attachment behaviors. We hypothesize
that theta-frequency stimulation of mPFC-NAcc will rescue affiliation/attachment deficits in ELSD voles. These
experiments will greatly expand our knowledge of the ELSD model of social deficits. They also directly test the
rescue of behavioral deficits using mPFC optogenetic stimulation to generate a new intervention. Future work
can build on this foundation by intervening during developmental to alter life-long trajectories in social
affiliation-attachment using sleep, molecular, and network-level approaches."
10919862,"Project Summary
 Relative to kidneys from European American (EA) deceased donors (DDs), kidneys transplanted from
African American (AA) DDs have significantly shorter graft survival. Several landmark studies revealed kidney
transplants from DDs with two apolipoprotein L1 gene (APOL1) risk variants, defining APOL1 high-risk
genotypes, have shorter graft survival. APOL1-associated lesions were detected in most failed grafts from these
APOL1 high-risk genotype DDs. Importantly, many kidneys transplanted from DDs with two APOL1 risk variants
do not fail rapidly. We hypothesize that APOL1 interacts with other environmental and inherited factors to cause
early failure of DD kidney transplants (DDKT). The National Institutes of Health (NIH) established the “APOL1
Long-term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes” (APOLLO) U01 Consortium in 2017 to prospectively address
several critical questions regarding broad APOL1 genotyping in AA DDKT and assessing safety in AA live kidney
donation. Results could transform the US policy for allocation of kidneys and lead to improved graft survival,
reassignment of AA DD kidneys to lower (i.e., better) kidney donor profile index (KDPI) classification and thus
lesser discard of good-quality kidneys and more kidney transplants, greater assurance of safety for living AA
donors, and cost savings. In addition, the role of recipient APOL1 genotypes on transplant outcomes is
controversial and APOLLO addresses this question. The APOLLO Consortium includes a Scientific and Data
Research Center (SDRC) and 13 Clinical Centers (CCs), including our center. Our CC, the “10/14 APOL1 Long-
term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Network (APOLLO) Clinical Center” at the University of Maryland School
of Medicine (UMSOM) and Medical Center (UMMC) is comprised of 4 additional kidney transplant programs at
the Sentara, Georgetown, George Washington, and Children’s National Hospitals. We recruited recipients of AA
DD and LD kidney transplants and AA live donors during the initial phase of APOLLO. Through 9/29/22, the
APOLLO SDRC and Consortium have prospectively collected DNA from a national cohort of 3604 AA DDs and
are following outcomes in 4890 DDKT. The 13 APOLLO CCs consented and collected bio-samples from 2436
DDKT recipients. In APOLLO Phase 1, our University of Maryland CC enrolled 65.3% of all recipients of an
APOLLO DDKT with DNA and biosamples (81 out of 124). We also recruited 32 AA LD and 28 AA LDKT
recipients. In APOLLO Phase 2, the Specific Aims of our CC are to: Aim 1. To prospectively collect long-term
follow-up data on all APOLLO participants. Aim 2. To provide detailed clinical data and biospecimens on
APOLLO participants from our CC. Aim 3. To facilitate return of APOL1 genotype results. Impact: APOL1
genotyping has the potential to reduce the discard of good-quality kidneys from AA donors and increase the
number of transplants overall. Identifying the secondary environmental or genetic factors that modify phenotypic
outcomes will improve allograft survival and quality of life for all transplant recipients."
10892896,"Project Summary
Diabetes rates are higher in Deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) populations than hearing
populations, most likely due to a lack of access to linguistically and culturally relevant health
information. American Sign Language has a different grammar structure and syntax to English,
therefore written diabetes education materials (e.g., handouts, websites) may not be understood
by a DHH person living with diabetes. Given this, DHH populations have a critical barrier to
diabetes information, yet do have access to technology, such as the internet, to obtain
information in American Sign Language. Our overarching goal is to increase access to diabetes
education content by developing and testing a website, Deaf Can Together, in American Sign
Language. Our community advisory board has identified the need for a trustworthy and “Deaf-
friendly” website that will include videos in American Sign Language with or without
supplemental pictures, visual graphics, storytelling, and visual demonstration. Such a website
will fill the gap in the lack of access to health information. This study is informed by the ADAPT
model and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology. Our specific aims are to first,
prototype and build a diabetes informational website, Deaf Can Together, that addresses the
cultural and linguistic needs of Deaf and hard of hearing populations. Specifically, we will co-
design the website with the DHH community with our existing community advisory board.
Second, we will evaluate the usability, acceptability, and efficacy of the Deaf Can Together
website. Using a mixed method approach, we will collect data from N=40 DHH people with
diabetes who are given access to the website. Third, we will conduct an initial dissemination of
the Deaf Can Together website. We have several partners for dissemination, including DHH
organizations, professional diabetes organizations, and the Network of National Libraries of
Medicine Region 4. Using a multipronged approach, we will reach DHH people living with
diabetes, clinicians who care for DHH people living with diabetes, and medical librarians. We
expect that providing culturally and linguistically tailored diabetes website will significantly
reduce health disparities in the DHH community."

This is a Beeson (K76) Emerging Leaders in Aging career development award for Bharati Kochar, MD, MS, a
physician-investigator and gastroenterologist specializing in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) with the long
term goal of advancing care for the growing, but understudied, population of older adults with gastroenterological
conditions. While IBD has traditionally afflicted young adults, adults ≥60 years are the fastest growing age group
with IBD and comprise at least 25% of the ambulatory patient population. However, older adults comprise <1%
of patients in IBD clinical trials. The expanding arsenal of immunosuppressive therapies include risks for
infections and thrombotic events, all of which occur more frequently in older adults. This proposal addresses the
urgent need to generate high quality data on IBD treatment safety, effectiveness and applicability to older adults
to optimize and effectively tailor treatments. Preliminary data revealed that frailty, measured both as an
accumulation of deficits and as a phenotype, is a construct pertinent in IBD. However, the relationship between
frailty, function, type of and response to IBD treatments and adverse events in older adults with IBD is unknown.
The goal of this proposal is to investigate the components of frailty and function in predicting adverse effects
with IBD treatments in older adults. The specific aims are to (1) retrospectively determine differential increased
risks for adverse events associated with a frailty index among initiators of classes of IBD treatments in adults
≥60 years and (2) prospectively delineate trajectories of phenotypic frailty by response to IBD treatment in adults
≥60 years. Data from these aims will inform (Aim 3a) the derivation a geriatric-informed adverse event risk
prediction model to identify older adults with IBD at greatest risk for infections, hospitalizations and worsening
self-reported function by type of IBD-treatment. The proposal will culminate by (Aim 3b) assessing the feasibility
of conducting an IBD-specific, geriatric-informed, assessment in clinical practice. These aims will result in the
first systematic application of geriatric principles to guide management of older adults with IBD and lay the
foundation for a program of independent investigation. Dr. Kochar will achieve these aims with the guidance of
an exceptional cross-disciplinary internationally renowned mentorship team and advisory team of national
leaders. Primary mentor Dr. Christine Ritchie is an expert on patient complexity in geriatrics, Dr. Andrew Chan
is an expert in chronic disease and colon cancer epidemiology and Dr. Ashwin Ananthakrishnan is an IBD
thought leader. This award also supports structured didactic, applied and experiential training in advanced
competing risk and prediction modeling, aging-research including expertise in frailty and function, designing a
patient decision aid and leadership development. The combination of unparalleled mentorship, in-depth training
and meaningful research aims at the intersection of her mentors’ expertise lays the foundation for Dr. Kochar to
develop a pathway to independent investigation. This work will position Dr. Kochar to be a leader at the
intersection of geriatrics and gastroenterology and develop a novel field of “Geriatric Gastroenterology.”"
10852973,"Abstract. The emergence of antibiotic resistance (AR) underscores the urgent need to develop novel
antimicrobial agents that are able to overcome current AR mechanisms. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) tend to
disrupt bacterial membranes regardless of resistance to traditional antibiotics. However, bacteria have also
evolved to resist the effects of AMPs by reducing (e.g., incorporation of phosphoethanolamine), not eliminating,
the net electronegative charge of lipid A, an important component of LPS targeted by AMPs. Because a
minimum electronegative charge is essential to bacterial membrane integrity, AMPs can be optimized to
overcome limited changes in LPS, the most common resistance mechanism against endogenous AMPs and
colistin. We have developed an iterative framework for rational design of engineered cationic peptide antibiotics
(PAX) optimized for broad activity against multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. We used libraries of rationally
designed series of novel Trp-rich peptides differing by 2 residues at a time, 1 Val and 1 Arg to establish the
distinction between structural determinants of antimicrobial potency and those of host toxicity. As predicted,
lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) are achieved against MDR clinical isolates without substantial
increase in red blood cell lysis or toxicity to white blood cells at maximum test concentrations. Remarkably, one
of the selected PAX (E35) demonstrates efficacy when systemically administered at 4-5mg/kg either a single
dose (MDR P. aeruginosa infection) or multiple doses (MDR Klebsiella pneumonia infection) in mice. PAX
E35 also displayed a maximum tolerated dose of 30 mg/kg compared to 12-15 mg/kg of our initial lead peptide
WLBU2 now in phase 2 clinical trial. Our iterative framework minimizes trial and error for designing PAX with
enhanced systemic efficacy against MDR bacteria. Given the success against colistin-resistant (Col-R) bacteria,
the tendency is to claim that our work is done without thinking of potential shortcomings of the current PAX.
However, there are still too many unknowns. (1) MDR bacteria have not been exposed clinically to the peptides
as they have been to colistin. Once they do, it is almost certain that resistance frequency will steadily increase.
(2) The current structural optimization is only minimal because we have not yet determined how each of the
cationic (C) and hydrophobic (H) motifs contributes to bacterial recognition and killing. Thus, it is critical to
continue this important work while some of the PAX may progress to advanced pre-clinical and clinical studies.
We propose to define the contribution of the 2 motifs to target recognition and elimination using Col-R strains
that can be passaged to evolve resistance to the current PAX. The overarching goal of this proposal is to elucidate
the molecular determinants for bacterial resistance to PAX by uncoupling the C and H motifs of PAX to allow
C/H correlation with changes in LPS structures and corresponding bactericidal activity using both col-R and
PAX-R MDR clinical isolates. Impact: we will progress from a minimal one-drug to a comprehensive one-
therapeutic class approach with the ability to design or re-design PAX based on clinical challenges."
10738911,"The goal of this application is to obtain funding to acquire a Zeiss Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (LSM)
980 for use by several research investigators at the VA Nebraska-Western Iowa Heath Care System (VA-NWI)
in Omaha, Nebraska. There is a long history of strong and interactive collaborations at VA-NWI, in areas
encompassing obesity, diabetes and other metabolic diseases, nonalcoholic and alcoholic liver disease, chronic
lung disease, and reproductive health. Purchase of the confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM), a
fundamental technology relevant to many disciplines, will further enhance collaborations within VA-NWI and with
collaborators. We are requesting this specific system because it features enhanced detection capabilities,
automated target identification and deconvolution capabilities that boost the resolution beyond that of
conventional LSM microscopes. In addition, the LSM is capable of a wide range of detection modalities including
brightfield and multiple fluorescent wavelengths, essential for our diverse users. We propose two Aims:
Aim 1: To purchase and maintain a Zeiss Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy System for major use by VA-
funded researchers.
Aim 2: To promote scientific discovery and collaboration for VA researchers.
We provide a detailed plan for daily operation and supervision, user training and education, administrative
oversight through the formation of an Oversight Committee, fee structure for long-term sustainability, and
evaluation for program enhancement. No capability for confocal LSM currently exists on-site at VA-NWI.
Obtaining such a system to be housed at VA-NWI will create new research capability for our VA researchers,
and thus significantly enhance research capacity for both VA investigators and their collaborators. Proposed in
this application (see Table 1) are 9 Major VA Users who each have active VA I-01, RCS or CDA awards currently
supporting their research, and 1 Minor VA User who does not currently have VA funding. Our overall objective
with the acquisition of the Zeiss Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy System is to expand the research
capabilities and create new collaborations at VA-NWI that result in novel discoveries specifically applicable to
solving the health problems facing our Veterans. This technology, new to our Station, will significantly advance
our capabilities as the system is widely applicable to preclinical research applications in a variety of diseases
impacting Veterans, including metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes, alcoholic and nonalcoholic liver
disease, pulmonary disorders, and reproductive health. The flexibility of the system, the diversity of 8 highly
collaborative investigators, and the experience of the Oversight Committee should enable us to achieve our
goals. This state-of-the-art system will promote new research and collaborations at VA-NWI that would otherwise
not be possible."

Title: Novel multivalent viral vectored tuberculosis vaccines targeting lung immunity
Tuberculosis (TB) persists as the deadliest bacterial infection, with more than 10 million new cases of active TB
diagnosed and 1.5 million deaths attributed to TB worldwide each year, because there is no highly effective
preventative vaccine. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) also causes asymptomatic latent infections in ~25% of
the world’s population. Latently infected individuals have a 10% lifetime risk of developing active TB disease.
Vaccines that prevent pulmonary Mtb infection, limit reactivation from latency and/or therapeutically treat active
TB disease are urgently needed. The objective of this R21 proposal is to explore the unique immunological
features of an innovative Pichinde virus (PICV)-based vaccine platform combined with novel Mtb antigens to
develop next generation TB vaccines. PICV is a non-pathogenic arenavirus with a bi-segmented RNA genome.
The proposal exploits a recombinant PICV engineered with three RNA segments, rP18tri, which can encode two
additional open-reading frames (ORFs) to express antigens. The rP18tri platform is safe, versatile and induces
balanced antibody and T cell responses. Moreover, the rP18tri platform is simple to modify to produce a variety
of multivalent antigens, which enables rapid analysis of candidates to identify those antigens that induce the
greatest protection. The proposed research will test the hypothesis that optimized multivalent antigens delivered
intranasally via the rP18tri viral vector platform will induce robust protective immunity against pulmonary Mtb
infection. Preliminary data from proof-of-concept studies establish that rP18tri-based TB vaccines can be
efficiently generated, induce strong antigen-specific T cell immunity and protect against pulmonary Mtb infection
in a mouse aerosol challenge model. In this R21 proposal, we will generate additional rP18tri vector-based
multivalent TB vaccine candidates with novel immunogens (Aim 1), evaluate antibody as well as systemic and
lung tissue-resident T cell responses induced by these vaccines in mice (Aim 2), and assess the efficacy of these
vaccines for prevention of Mtb infection in a mouse model (Aim 3). The study is significant because it is
expected to produce at least one viral vectored multivalent TB vaccine candidate with demonstrated safety and
efficacy in mice to be advanced to the next phases of preclinical and clinical evaluations. The study is also
expected to generate new knowledge on protective immunity induced by novel Mtb antigens, which will guide
the design of next generation TB vaccines, and to advance development of the PICV vector platform, which will
expand the toolbox for fighting infectious diseases."
10912795,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs in up to one-quarter of all critically ill adults receiving
mechanical ventilation and is associated with high risk of morbidity and mortality, which is compounded by
ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI). Current ventilation strategies and standard care attempt to lessen the
effects of VILI, but have not been uniformly successful. The need for improved ventilation strategies have
become more compelling and urgent in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Precise ventilator titration of tidal
volumes to maintain driving pressure ≤ 12 cm H2O may improve overdistension injury and application of positive
end expiratory pressure (PEEP) with titration to transpulmonary pressure of 0±2cmH2O may prevent injury from
lung collapse. This U24 grant application will establish a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) that supports the
PREcision VENTilation to attenuate VILI Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) in conducting a multicenter,
prospective phase III randomized trial to test the hypothesis that this precision ventilation strategy will improve
60-day mortality compared to guided usual care in patients with moderate or severe ARDS. The DCC will provide
the infrastructure, support, oversight and quality control necessary to conduct this trial guided by the following
aims: Aim 1 - To collaborate in the protocol development. The DCC will assist the CCC in defining the
overarching plan of the trial, and ensure the inclusion of essential sections within the protocol document. Aim 2
- To design and execute an appropriate, pre-determined, innovative statistical plan including analysis of study
data, assessment of safety, investigation of mechanism of benefit, and facilitation of manuscript preparation.
Aim 3 – To facilitate a patient centered study, with community engagement, by providing video-assisted consent
materials, real-time reporting of accrual rates, with emphasis on ensuring a diverse participant population and
ensuring patient safety by providing clear instructions on identification and timing of adverse event reporting and
creation of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Aim 4 - To support an advanced physiological core laboratory
to integrate physiological expertise into trial conduct and data management and to ensure rigor and
reproducibility of respiratory waveform interpretation used for protocol-directed ventilator management in the
intervention arm. The DCC will review all physiological waveforms submitted by sites and provide feedback
regarding quality and interpretation. Aim 5 - To provide data administration and monitor trial activities. The DCC
will build the eCRFs on a state-of-the-art electronic data capture system. During enrollment, the DCC will ensure
high-quality data collection and measure and improve protocol compliance. To foster site communication and
identity, the DCC will develop a trial website and quarterly newsletter, and assist the CCC in organizing meetings
and conference calls. Aim 6 - To ensure completeness of the study and post-trial activities. This includes meeting
milestones and end-of-trial support for participating sites and providing the funding agency with a finalized,
deidentified, and locked data set for public use."
10877934,"Project Summary
 Small bowel intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are the first line of defense against human enteric viruses, the
most common and leading causes of diarrhea and death in infants and young children. How IECs
communicate with intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) in the small intestine and orchestrate antiviral responses
is heavily understudied. Our overall objectives are to better define the host immune signaling pathways in the
gastrointestinal tract during infections and to use that information to develop therapeutic interventions to
alleviate diarrhea and sequelae.
 Our preliminary results contrasted our expectation and demonstrated that the numbers of two IEL subsets
are significantly reduced during early rotavirus infection in vivo. We also found that rotavirus infection alters the
expression of several pro-inflammatory chemokines in infected human and mouse IECs. Based on these data
and prior publications, we hypothesize that the IELs are important mediators of host defense against
rotavirus infection and that rotavirus-encoded factors antagonize the antiviral activity of IELs in the
host small intestine via inhibition of chemokine expression.
 Testing these hypotheses is currently hampered by the lack of suitable model systems. Accordingly, we
have developed a highly tractable murine rotavirus reverse genetics method, a pathologically relevant neonatal
mouse model, and several innovative primary human and murine small bowel organoid culturing systems,
which will provide an unprecedented resolution of understanding of IEC-IEL crosstalk in the context of enteric
viral infections.
 In Aim 1, we will define a functional antiviral role of IELs in rotavirus infection in vivo using immunological
approaches and gene knockout mice. In Aim 2, we will identify the potential mechanism by which viral factors
dampen chemokine expression in infected IECs. Collectively, we expect these studies to establish a new
paradigm of mucosal antiviral immunity, especially early in life when most enteric infections occur. We also
expect to identify novel rotavirus immune evasion strategies, which will inform new strategies to develop host-
based broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics and next-generation vaccine candidates."
10906224,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Congenital heart defects (CHD) affect over 2.4 million individuals in the
U.S and generate $6.1 billion in annual healthcare costs. Avoidance of tobacco is vital to mitigate CHD
survivors’ risk for acquired cardiovascular complications, but the youth e-cigarette (“vaping”) crisis exposes the
growing and vulnerable population of adolescents (“teens”) with CHD to potential vaping-related harms and
significantly increases risk for conventional cigarette use. Interventions to prevent vaping among teens with
CHD are critically needed, but no existing programs are sufficient for this at-risk group. Dr. Fox’s TL1
fellowship research showed that 31% of teens with CHD are susceptible to vaping and identified perceived
stress and poor disease knowledge as potential risk factors, but existing programs do not address these
considerations. The proposed research will generate and evaluate the first vaping prevention intervention
tailored for teens with CHD. Aim 1: Adapt curriculum from an evidence-based, classroom-delivered vaping
prevention intervention to include critical stress management and disease knowledge modules in a mobile
Health (mHealth) format for teens (12-18 years) with CHD. Intervention adaptation/refinement will occur via: 1)
focus groups with key stakeholders (teens with CHD, parents, cardiologists) to understand intervention
preferences, and 2) a single-arm pilot trial of the adapted mHealth intervention (N=16) with follow-up focus
groups to gather information for refinement. Aim 2: Evaluate the feasibility/acceptability of the mHealth
intervention via a pilot randomized clinical trial (RCT; N=72). Exploratory Aim 3: Explore the preliminary
efficacy of the mHealth intervention for indicators of vaping prevention (vaping-related efficacy, perceived
vaping outcomes, e-cigarette knowledge). These aims directly align with Dr. Fox’s career goal of becoming an
independent clinician-scientist with expertise in behavioral RCTs and scalable disease self-management
interventions for transition-aged teens with CHD. To achieve this goal, Dr. Fox requires advanced training in
the following areas: 1) behavioral intervention science to design and optimize interventions that can be
implemented on a public health level, such as mHealth modalities, 2) RCT methodology and analysis to
rigorously evaluate behavioral interventions for efficacy and effectiveness, and 3) CHD disease self-
management and healthcare for transition-aged teens to incorporate unique factors of living with CHD into
tailored interventions. The career development plan involves didactic and applied training and leverages expert
multidisciplinary (public health, clinical/quantitative psychology, cardiology) mentorship from The Abigail
Wexner Research Institute at Nationwide Children’s Hospital, one of the worlds’ fastest growing pediatric
research centers, its academic affiliate The Ohio State University, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
Center. This K23 proposal will provide high-quality preliminary data and instill expertise needed for an R01
efficacy trial, advancing toward the ultimate goal of enhancing wellbeing across the lifespan of CHD."
10741765,"Project Summary. The primary auditory cortex (A1) is a central site of convergence for ascending sensory
projections and projections from diverse neuromodulatory regions. These inputs interact in A1 to both influence
moment-to-moment cortical activity and drive long-lasting changes in synaptic connections that may underlie
auditory behavioral learning. Our recent work has revealed that a diverse group of inhibitory interneurons in
cortical layer 1 (L1) has a privileged capacity to integrate tuned sensory input from the auditory thalamus and
neuromodulatory inputs from cholinergic and serotonergic brain regions. These L1 interneurons send spatially-
precise axonal projections to their postsynaptic targets that powerfully control cortical network activity and
plasticity. Our recent results suggest that two distinct classes of L1 interneurons defined by the expression of
either neuron-derived neurotrophic factor (NDNF) or vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) may receive differential
inputs and send distinct outputs to their cortical targets. We propose that each L1 interneuron class has a
specialized function in controlling cortical activity and plasticity. However, the mechanisms by which NDNF and
VIP L1 interneuron subtypes are activated and control cortical state and plasticity are not fully understood. To
address this unknown, we will use anatomical, trans-synaptic viral tracing, and electrophysiological approaches
to elucidate the pre and post-synaptic partners of NDNF and VIP L1 interneurons in mouse A1. We will also use
two-photon imaging in behaving mice to determine the in vivo activity and plasticity of NDNF and VIP L1
interneurons during auditory perceptual learning. The results of this research will identify L1 circuit mechanisms
that promote auditory plasticity in adulthood and can be exploited to advance treatments following hearing loss."

 Guidelines for anti-seizure medications in older adult populations are incomplete or non-existent, even
though the risk of recurrent unprovoked seizures (epilepsy) in adults peaks at 80 years old. As a group, anti-
seizure medications are generally thought to be equally efficacious and medication choice should be informed
by the secondary effects of these drugs. Older adults are likely to be particularly vulnerable to cognitive adverse
effects because they may have lower cognitive reserve, undetected/undiagnosed neurodegeneration, competing
cognitive impairing disorders, and often take other CNS-active drugs. Despite the increased risk and abundance
of new prescriptions in older adults, most evaluation of the safety and effects of anti-seizure medications on
cognition have been done in short-term studies in younger cohorts. No anti-seizure medication prescribing
guidelines exist for older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer’s Disease and related
dementias (ADRD). Currently, little information exists regarding anti-seizure medication use including: whether
and how drug titration occurs, therapeutic drug monitoring, or how use may differ in older adults with dementia.
 In order to improve care, we must understand how and why particular anti-seizure medications are
prescribed. We currently have limited understanding of how prescribers make decisions, including weighing any
possible cognitive adverse effects, when adding and removing anti-seizure medications in older adults. These
knowledge gaps are barriers to developing safe, effective and evidence-based treatment strategies.
 This study will use a large representative study of older adults (the Health and Retirement Study linked to
Medicare data) to (1) understand differences in current use, titration, continuation, and laboratory monitoring of
anti-seizure medications in older adults with seizures, with and without ADRD, (2) examine the comparative
effect of commonly prescribed anti-seizure medications on cognitive decline and incident dementia, and (3)
recruit a national sample of prescribers (e.g. primary care, internal medicine, geriatrics, emergency medicine,
neurology) to understand decision-making in the context of anti-seizure medication prescription in older adults.
 My long-term goal is to develop an independent program focused on health services research to improve the
care for older adults with seizure and dementia. The completion of this project will lay the foundation for a career
of translating best evidence into practice. This project will form the backbone of an integrated training plan that
will refine my existing pharmacoepidemiologic and biostatistical skills. Further, it will allow me to develop new
knowledge in qualitative methods, geriatrics and cognitive decline. The training plan, focused mentorship and
proposed project will allow me to learn, develop and apply the skills necessary for a successful transition to
become an independent health services and outcomes researcher, and lay the groundwork for a trial of a
multimodality intervention to improve prescribing in older adults with seizure, cognitive impairment and dementia."

Social media has accelerated the spread of vaccine misinformation leading to decreased immunization rates
and increased preventable deaths in the US and globally. The health impact of misinformation is particularly
critical to understand and address when considering the lives of minoritized racial and ethnic groups who are
often the target of misinformation campaigns or who may not have easy access to culturally relevant and
language-concordant reputable sources. Although access to vaccines remains a significant barrier, vaccine
safety confidence is a significant predictor of influenza and COVID vaccination in Hispanic adults. Yet,
little is known about how misinformation narratives emerge specifically in relation to Hispanic communities, how
they are disseminated, and how they ultimately affect people’s decision to get vaccinated.
Social media posts that include personal narratives are more effective at communicating reliable health
recommendations, especially those that come from a trusted peer. Therefore, communication strategies that
leverage community and interpersonal relationships can prove extremely effective at debunking misinformation
about vaccines. Promotores de salud are trusted community members who serve as links between health/social
services and a community to improve access to health services and quality of service delivery. Promotores can
diffuse and address misinformation in their communities and can be essential to debunk myths, increase trust,
and improve health outcomes; they have been at the forefront of addressing disparities in COVID testing and
vaccine uptake. Promotores de salud are uniquely positioned as trusted messengers to debunk vaccine
misinformation through strategic use of social media and infodemiology principles.
Dime La VerDAD (Verify, Debunk, and Disseminate) is an innovative social media capacity-building program
based on theoretical frameworks related to health communication that empowers promotores de salud to debunk
vaccine misinformation through the use of personal narratives on social media. The proposed work will use a
rigorous stepped wedge design to 1) deliver a scalable program of science communicators using an adapted
curriculum grounded in infodemiology, 2) evaluate how debunking misinformation is perceived on social media,
and 3) discern how use of personal narratives to enhance science communication can lead to changes in
opinions and behavior (vaccination rates) about COVID and influenza vaccines among Chicago’s predominantly
Hispanic communities."

Obesity and diabetes have reached epidemic proportions in modern society, with treatments and comorbidities
costing billions of dollars in health care costs each year. Concurrent with increases in obesity and diabetes have
been decreases in the amount of sleep millions of Americans obtain on a nightly basis. Though associations
between short sleep and poor metabolic health are clear, exact mechanisms driving poor health are not well-
understood. For example, inducing sleep restriction inherently results in a number of confounding variables, most
notably circadian disruption, which also independently impairs health. It is thus difficult to develop targeted
interventions without first identifying the individual and combined effects of chronic sleep restriction and circadian
disruption on metabolism. The goal of this project is to systematically determine the influence of chronic sleep
restriction and circadian disruption, both independently and in combination, on metabolic health. Our specific
aims are to: 1) uncover the impact of chronic sleep restriction, circadian timing, and their combination on energy
intake patterns; 2) determine the influence of chronic sleep restriction on food choice when there is equal
opportunity to eat at all circadian times; and 3) uncover the impact of chronic sleep restriction, circadian timing,
and their combination, on glucose tolerance. To accomplish our aims, we have designed a 14-day randomized-
control mechanistic study in which participants will be either chronically sleep restricted or not while all activities
are scheduled to occur evenly across all circadian phases on a 20-h “day” with ad libitum food access. We
hypothesize that when individuals have equal opportunities to eat at all circadian times, they will 1) consume
greater amounts of calories during the circadian evening independent of sleep condition, 2) sleep restriction will
result in higher evening carbohydrate consumption, which will be associated with higher endocannabinoid
concentrations, and 3) chronic sleep restriction will result in more impaired glucose tolerance after circadian
disruption. These data will provide a fundamental understanding of how chronic sleep restriction and circadian
disruption impacts metabolic health. Importantly, these data will have far-reaching implications, particularly in
the development of interventions to promote healthy weight in not only individuals that are overweight/obese,
but also those at risk for obesity who live on short sleep schedules and/or work on extended duration, rotating,
or permanent nightshifts. This project also meets the following High-Priority Research Areas for future research
in the NIH National Center on Sleep Disorders Research (NCSDR) plan. Goal 1: Elucidate the Sleep and
Circadian Mechanisms Underlying Health and Disease, particularly in identifying sleep and circadian influences
on the biology underlying obesity and cardiometabolic risk in humans and to better tailor interventions in clinical-
translational studies, and Goal 2: Improve the Treatment of Sleep and Circadian Disorders and Reduce the Risks
Associated with Sleep Deficiency and Circadian Misalignment, particularly in elucidating the relationship between
circadian biology, sleep health, and the timing of food intake on cardiometabolic health and obesity."

Poverty and racism are linked to disparities in early child development (ECD), including school readiness (pre-
academic skills, self-regulation, social-emotional well-being), which are a core contributor to long-term health
and mental health outcomes. These disparities begin early in life, widen as children age, and persist across the
lifespan. Poverty and racism also increase the likelihood of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and
decrease the likelihood of positive childhood experiences (PCEs). Importantly, PCEs are not simply the
absence of ACEs; they are factors that are beneficial for children’s development and may be especially
important in providing a buffer for the impacts of ACEs. Two interrelated frameworks (Stress and Investment)
illustrate how ACEs and PCEs impact ECD through a key common pathway of early relational health (ERH;
parent-child relationship quality, structuring the home environment, responsivity/cognitive stimulation). Thus,
enhancing ERH by both addressing ACEs and promoting PCEs is critical for mitigating disparities in ECD.
Evidence-based preventive interventions (EBPIs) designed to reduce these disparities have increasingly been
located in pediatric primary care due to its population-level reach, frequent visits, trusted relationships, and
potential for low cost. However, few EBPIs have successfully integrated strategies to concurrently and directly
address ACEs and promote PCEs, limiting their capacity to fully address disparities synergistically, particularly
for families with fewer resources. Moreover, knowledge gaps related to dissemination and implementation
(D&I) of integrated EBPIs represent a key barrier to improving implementation effectiveness and impact.
We propose a novel integration of HealthySteps (HS) and Video Interaction Project (VIP), two exemplar,
American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)-recommended EBPIs. HS provides a stepped-care approach with
universal screening for ACEs and additional support and referrals for families with increased concerns. HS has
been shown to reduce family vulnerabilities and negative relationship quality elements of ERH. However, HS
has limited impact on PCEs, suggesting additional strategies may be needed to improve effectiveness of the
HS stepped-care approach in enhancing ERH. Integrating VIP may address this gap with its focus on video-
recording parents and children interacting with a toy or book provided by the program and real-time, strengths-
based feedback. VIP has impacts on parenting assets and responsivity/cognitive stimulation elements of ERH.
We will test an integrated HS+VIP model in order to: 1) identify best practice strategies for implementing
integrated EBPIs in diverse pediatric care sites; 2) examine effectiveness and implementation outcomes of the
HS+VIP model; and 3) examine health disparities mechanisms underlying these outcomes. This integrated
model has the potential for population-level reductions in disparities in ECD outcomes by targeting ACEs and
PCEs simultaneously and will provide strong support for developing best practices for the D&I of such models."

recently identified and named a novel gene NHIP (neuronal hypoxia inducible, placenta
associated) and demonstrated its epigenetic, genetic, and transcriptional association with autism.
NHIP is transiently expressed in response to hypoxia and neuronal differentiation, two examples
of elevated oxidative stress. NHIP encodes a previously undiscovered micropeptide that localizes
to the nucleus and is predicted to be neuroprotective, based on the lower expression of NHIP in
placenta and brain samples from autism compared to control. The predicted structure of the NHIP
peptide is an amphipathic helix that has similarity to a 9aaTAD motif found in transcriptional
activation domains of many DNA binding proteins. We propose to test the hypothesis that NHIP
acts as a competitive inhibitor of multi-protein complexes, thereby protecting developing and
differentiating neurons following transient waves of hypoxia. Because NHIP is an “undiscovered
protein” whose function had not been described before our recent study, this proposal will focus
on the major research questions that are critical for determining the therapeutic relevance of
NHIP. Specifically, what is the function of NHIP in neurons and brain, how is it regulated in
response to hypoxia, and is it protective of neuronal oxidative stress? We propose three specific
aims using well-characterized in vitro and in vivo models, including an inducible human neuronal
cell line (LUHMES) engineered for NHIP transcript or peptide loss, human brain extracts with
known NHIP genotype and expression levels, and mouse brain following NHIP peptide
administration and/or hypoxia. Aim 1 will determine the molecular mechanisms of NHIP function
and examine both protein-specific and global cellular impacts of NHIP loss. Aim 2 will determine
how NHIP is transcriptionally responsive to hypoxia-induced oxidative stress by identifying the
transcription factors and their genetic and epigenetic requirements for binding to the NHIP
promoter and enhancer. Aim 3 will determine if exogenously delivered NHIP/NHIP protects
neurons and embryonic neural precursor cells from hypoxia-induced oxidative stress. Together,
the results from these proposed studies will provide the first functional characterization of NHIP,
an understudied micropeptide that is associated with resilience to autism spectrum disorders. The
potential impact of these results will be a potential therapeutic small molecule that could be used
in early intervention therapy for autism and other neurodevelopmental or hypoxia-related
disorders."
10851943,"Successful monitoring tumor response to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) could offer the opportunity to tightly-
tailored individualized therapy in patients with breast cancer. Current treatment of breast cancer generally applies
a “one-size fits all” regardless of treatment success. The ability to monitor “on-treatment” response is critical for
both 1) the patients that have complete response and could benefit from reduced NAC to reduce morbidity and
2) to the patients who are not responding to current NAC to suggest a change in treatments which induce greater
anti-tumor response. Thus, the ability to reliably monitor tumor response to NAC treatment via an imaging-based
system is a vital step toward realizing patient-tailored therapy and would enable us to further move away from a
“one size fits all” paradigm in breast oncology. Therefore, we propose to develop a new Squaraine-based
biosensor (SAB) to identify apoptosis detectable using a new imaging technology, Multispectral Optoacoustic
Tomography (MSOT). As MSOT is a new imaging technology, exogenous reporter dyes are limited to 2 FDA
approved dyes, isosulfane blue and indocynaine green, neither of which can be conjugated to peptides. Our
objective is to: (1) develop a new optoacoustically optimized conjugatable reporter dye as part of the apoptosis
biosensor and (2) test the Squaraine apoptosis biosensor (SAB) in vivo to identify apoptosis following
chemotherapy treatment in vivo.
We propose to build upon our recent success of identifying tumors using multispectral optoacoustic tomography
combined with our expertise in NIR dye chemistry and molecular biology. To improve specificity of cell uptake of
the prototype SAB, we have included a portion of a cell penetrating peptide that is responsive to extracellular
acidic pH. We hypothesize that our lead prototype for the Squaraine Apoptosis Biosensor (SAB) will have
improved cell penetrating peptide (TS-CPP) and “turn on” at the apoptosis sequence, DEVD, to separate the
Squaraine dye from the QC1 dye, ultimately identifying apoptosis. To test our hypothesis, we propose the
following aims: 1) develop and characterize derivatives of prototype Squaraine to serve as the reporter for the
Squaraine apoptosis biosensor (SAB); 2) assess performance of optimized Squaraine and SAB as optoacoustic
agents in vitro; and 3) assess optimized SAB to facilitate detection of apoptosis in breast tumors in vivo using
multispectral optoacoustic tomography. Successful completion of these specific aims will develop an apoptosis
biosensor that ultimately could be used to identify apoptosis in vivo and clinically to monitor tumor response and
a new reporter dye detectable using optoacoustic imaging. Ultimately, this apoptosis biosensor would be well
suited for use as part of a multispectral contrast agent cocktail for identifying molecular features of disease."
10914272,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The objective of this proposal is to establish and translate novel noninvasive imaging methods and blood
markers prognostic of incomplete wound healing in the setting of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). Over 30 million
people live with diabetes in the United States. DFUs account for 25-50% of all diabetes-related hospital costs
in the US totaling approximately $40 billion per year and are often the first recognized sign of impending limb
loss. The lifetime risk for DFU is up to 25% and its treatment is resource-intensive requiring antibiotics,
frequent wound care, and surgical procedures, yet 1-year healing rates are only 75%. Once an ulcer forms, the
risk of limb loss is high with up to 20% of patients undergoing lower-extremity amputation. Strong basic and
clinical evidence demonstrates both initiation of ulcers and poor wound healing arise from reduced tissue
perfusion and ischemia. At the cellular level, non-healing DFU reflect a chronic inflammatory state. Transition
from a pro- to an anti-inflammatory/pro-repair state—required for wound resolution—relies on the adequate
immunometabolic programming of recruited neutrophils and monocytes. Altered glycolysis and oxidative
metabolism is well-documented in diabetes across these myeloid subsets, and this is associated with impaired
wound healing, however their precise impact in the setting of DFU is unknown. Currently there are no effective
clinical tools for predicting ulcer healing. We hypothesize that a multiparametric approach using perfusion
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and immunometabolic profiling will improve diagnosis of poor wound
healing in DFU and inform more targeted treatment strategies in this complex condition. Our NIDDK Diabetic
Complications Consortium pilot study shows feasibility of using perfusion MRI and monocyte cellular
respirometry for predicting wound healing DFU. With this technical foundation established, the proposed study
will extend these methods for improved characterization of incomplete wound repair in DFUs. We will pursue
three related specific aims. In Aim 1, we will benchmark sensitivity and reproducibility of perfusion MRI
measurements to characterize microcirculatory abnormalities in patients with DFUs and predict wound healing.
In Aim 2, we will establish systemic and local metabolic markers of poor wound healing in DFU. In Aim 3, we
will apply multiparametric statistical learning to perfusion MRI and blood markers to develop predictive models
of impaired wound healing in DFU. We expect this work to provide novel information for more effective
treatment strategies of DFU. If successful, this classification platform will improve phenotyping of DFU patients
for more personalized treatment strategies and lead to improved clinical management of DFU."
10737619,"RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII) transcribes short, highly structured non-coding RNAs involved in diverse cellular
processes, including translation, transcription regulation, and splicing. The biomedical relevance of RNAPIII
activity in humans is wide-ranging: tRNA, 5S rRNA, vault RNA, 7SL RNA, and small NF90-associated RNA
(snaR) have been shown to be either elevated or depleted in tumors, neurodegenerative brain tissues, viral-
infected B cells, parasite-infected macrophages, and HER2-positive breast cancer cells, respectively. While these
and other examples highlight aberrant activities in distinct health-related contexts, a growing body of evidence
suggests that multiple RNAPIII-transcribed gene subclasses play important roles in the context of heart
development and disease: tRNA and other small RNA levels are altered during early stages of cardiac
differentiation and depleted in response to hypoxia, loss of 7SK RNA is sufficient to induce cardiac hypertrophy,
RMRP RNA is elevated in mouse models of cardiac hypertrophy and in patients with ischemic heart-failure, and
RNAPIII-transcribed Y RNA confers cardioprotection to oxidatively stressed cardiomyocytes. Despite these
findings, little is currently known about the functional role of dynamic non-coding RNA levels within these
contexts, or whether differences in RNA levels are driven by RNAPIII transcription due in part to several unique
challenges related to the sequencing and alignment of short, highly structured and repetitive RNAs. The
proposed study seeks to address these deficiencies by developing new high-throughput genomic methods for
profiling RNAPIII transcription and applying these strategies in the context of stem cell-to-cardiomyocyte
differentiation. In addition, functional experiments will test the role of dynamic RNAPIII patterns within these
contexts, and a genetic-background correction method will be developed to enable future comparisons of
RNAPIII transcription across diverse cellular contexts, accounting for differences in copy number variation
(CNV) in samples of non-identical genomic origin. The proposed study is the next logical step in my progression
to becoming an independently funded investigator with an active and successful research program identifying
the role and underlying regulatory mechanisms of RNAPIII transcription within diverse cellular contexts and
human disease. This project will provide critical training in human stem cell and cardiac biology, CNV detection
methodology, and computational biology and statistics, critical skills necessary to establish my research program
and accomplish my long-term goals as an independent group leader. Together, results of this study promise to
establish improved genomic tools of significant interest to the scientific community, and to yield important
insight on the role and regulation of RNAPIII-transcribed genes during cellular differentiation."
10737620,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome (22q11.2 DS), is associated with ~20-fold increased risk for psychosis.
Brain imaging studies have consistently demonstrated abnormal functional connectivity in the cerebral cortex.
Preclinical studies using cerebral cortex neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC),
revealed mitochondrial defects, neuronal hyperexcitability and calcium signaling defects, supporting the findings
of cortical circuit dysfunction. However, the exact cellular and molecular mechanisms by which the 22q11.2
deletion leads to abnormal development and function of the cerebral cortex remain to be elucidated.
 The 22q11.2 chromosomal region contains 9 genes associated with mitochondrial energy production. Human
blood samples revealed increased glycolysis, suggesting global metabolic alterations. Despite growing evidence
for mitochondrial and neuronal dysfunction in 22q11.2 DS, the metabolic and mitochondrial dysregulations
present in the human developing cerebral cortex remain unknown.
 We will test the hypothesis that human mitochondrial defects begin in proliferating neural progenitors and
impair temporal mitochondrial maturation, induce metabolic reprogramming and subsequent neuronal function
defects. We hypothesize these metabolic abnormalities are less pronounced in rodent models of disease.
Aim 1 will identify mitochondrial defects during cortical development in hCS and forebrain sections from a mouse
model for 22q11.2 DS, using advanced microscopy and functional assays.
Aim 2 will assess for metabolic alterations during cortical development in hCS and forebrain sections from a
mouse model for 22q11.2 DS, using untargeted metabolomics and cell type-specific metabolic profile.
Aim 3 will identify metabolic pathways as targets for therapeutic interventions by testing the rescue potential of
drugs known to enhance mitochondrial function (e.g. nicotinamide riboside, resveratrol, bezafibrate).
 Our multidisciplinary project will identify the initial timing and the exact metabolic and mitochondrial alteration
during the development of the cerebral cortex in 22q11.2 DS and pinpoint metabolic pathways for drug discovery,
(ii) assess for interspecies differences, and (iii) establish in vitro human neurometabolomics assays to study
other metabolic disorders of genetic or environmental etiology."
10737621,"Individuals with schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders suffer from abnormal social behaviors, for
which there are few effective treatments. Here we aim to gain insight into the brain mechanisms responsible for
such dysfunction, focusing on the role of altered patterns of neural network activity that may be amenable to
treatment with brain stimulation paradigms. We focus on the social memory (SM) deficits in the Df(16)A+/-
mouse model of the human 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, which confers one of the highest known genetic risk
factors for schizophrenia. Our studies during the present funding period demonstrate that the mouse SM deficit
results, at least in part, from abnormal activity of hippocampal CA2 pyramidal neurons, which are known to be
critical for SM. At the cellular level, CA2 pyramidal neurons in the Df(16)A+/- mice are hyperpolarized due to an
increase in the TREK-1 resting K+ current, leading to decreased excitability. Our in vivo recordings show that in
wild-type, but not Df(16)A+/- mice, CA2 pyramidal neurons act as detector of social novelty, with CA2 firing
differentially responding to a novel versus familiar mouse. Of particular interest, we found that pharmacological
and/or genetic inhibition of TREK-1 could rescue both SM and CA2 coding for social novelty in Df(16)A+/- mice.
Finally we found that upregulation of Mirta22/Emc10, a regulator of membrane protein trafficking that is de-
repressed in Df(16)A+/- mice due to microRNA dysregulation, is a key molecular consequence of the 22q11.2
deletion that contributes to abnormal SM. Here we aim to provide deeper insight into how alterations in CA2
function produce an abnormal form of brain oscillations known as sharp-wave ripples, events that are critical
for memory consolidation. We will examine how abnormal sharp-wave ripples affect SM, and whether
reinstatement of normal sharp-wave ripples by optogenetic brain stimulation can rescue SM. As sharp-wave
ripples are abnormal in CA1 of Df(16)A+/- mice, and as a significant fraction of sharp-wave ripples in CA1 arise
in CA2, we hypothesize that the deficit in SM in Df(16)A+/- mice may result from abnormal CA2 sharp-wave
ripples. Furthermore, we surmise that optogenetic activation of CA2 using appropriately shaped patterns of
light that can trigger normal SWRs in wild-type mice may reinstate normal SWRS in Df(16)A+/- mice, and this
may rescue SM. Finally to gain deeper insight into the link between molecular changes associated with the
22q11.2 genetic deletion and altered brain function, we will explore whether Mirta22/Emc10 upregulation
underlies CA2 dysfunction, including increased CA2 TREK-1 activity, abnormal social coding and abnormal
sharp-wave ripples. In this way we will provide a unified understanding linking the genetic, molecular, cellular,
network, and behavioral mechanisms that contribute to social cognitive dysfunction associated with a human
genetic mutation linked to neuropsychiatric disease, with the aim of identifying novel approaches to treatment
based on the rational design of brain stimulation paradigms."
10861875,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The formation of a percept results from the processing of sensory information across a network of brain
regions, each contributing uniquely to perception. Thus, to understand the mechanisms by which the brain
encodes sensory information, we must study each component of the network. Olfactory perception is dependent
upon a distributed network of processing centers, which are connected in serial and parallel manners. Odor
information is organized into receptor-specific channels mapped onto the olfactory bulb. These singular streams
of information are broadly projected by mitral/ tufted cells to multiple cortical structures. This direct, parallel input
is thought to allow each region to maintain a representation of the stimulus and play a unique role in odor
perception. While putative functions have been ascribed to several olfactory cortical regions, the importance of
the dorsal tenia tecta for olfactory perception remains a mystery. Here, we propose to examine the connectivity,
odor coding, and function of this region. Specific Aim 1 will examine the afferent and efferent connections of the
dorsal tenia tecta. Specific Aim 2 will characterize the odor tuning properties of dorsal tenia tecta neurons.
Specific Aim 3 will assess the contribution of this region for olfactory perception. Achieving these aims will provide
new insight into how odorant features are encoded and mapped within the brain and elucidate the function of
this enigmatic brain region for olfactory perception."
10910147,"Abstract/Project Summary
The ubiquitous need for transcription and pre-mRNA processing in eukaryotes requires an understanding of
the mechanisms by which they occur simultaneously and regulate each other. Our long-term goals are to
determine the mechanisms that govern co-transcriptional intron removal and how co-transcriptional splicing
contributes to gene expression regulation. With previous support from this grant, my lab has pioneered
strategies for purifying and sequencing nascent RNA – the transient intermediates in transcription and RNA
processing – to quantify pre-mRNA splicing relative to the position of elongating RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) on
the gene. Most introns are removed as soon as they emerge from Pol II, indicating that Pol II and the spliceosome
are timed to act together and physically close to one another. Knowing this, our overall objectives are to (i)
elucidate the co-transcriptional mechanism of “all-or-none” RNA processing, in which individual nascent
transcripts are either fully spliced and cleaved at the 3’ end (all) or fully unspliced and uncleaved (none). My lab
discovered this recently by sequencing full-length nascent RNAs, and it is a major co-transcriptional regulatory
mechanism for b-globin gene expression. (ii) Determine how the potential for splicing becomes limited as
transcription proceeds and the nascent transcript gets longer. And (iii) Determine the fate and possible function
of the unprocessed transcripts. The central hypothesis is that the potential for nascent RNA to bind positive- and
negative-acting RNA binding proteins and/or to undergo intermolecular base-pairing and compaction increases
as the nascent chain grows during transcription. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing three specific aims: 1)
develop a method to determine the local base-pairing behavior of nascent RNA, using DMS chemistry and
nascent RNA purification. The results of this aim will tell us the degree to which nascent RNA becomes
transiently structured during transcription and if local structures correlate with positive or negative effects on
splicing, 2) identify activator and/or repressor proteins that accumulate on the growing nascent chain during
transcription, using biochemical purification and in vivo labeling approaches. 3) determine the nuclear response
to unprocessed “none” transcripts. Are they delayed in processing? Or will they be degraded? For this aim, we
have established the A-count method, which sequences the entire transcript from 5’ end to 3’ end, including the
whole length of the polyA tail, which will be counted by nucleotide type and number. Our preliminary results
show that the nuclear polyA binding protein PABPN1 is regulated by phosphorylation during mitosis,
suggesting differential fates for nuclear retained mRNAs with introns. PABPN1 is a protein mutated in
Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD). The proposed research is significant because these mechanisms
operating at the level of pre-mRNA processing can change protein product amounts by at least 10-fold, showing
that RNA processing is as important for gene expression as regulation by transcription factors."

The overarching goal of the proposed research is to predict the intracellular and extracellular concentration-
time profiles using models that include membrane partitioning, membrane permeability, organ blood flow,
active transport, and metabolism. In the funding period from 2018-2022, we have made significant progress in
developing models to predict drug volume of distribution, and models to predict drug absorption. We have used
the basic principles underlying permeability and partitioning to build a new framework for PBPK models
(termed PermQ). This framework now allows us to incorporate permeability-limited distribution, partitioning,
organ blood flow, and active transport into PBPK models with explicit membrane kinetics. We have started to
build upon our current work to develop novel frameworks to predict drug clearance, a new focus of this
renewal. These new modeling paradigms, together with our time- and distance- dependent continuous
absorption models, will provide markedly better predictions of intracellular concentrations in the presence of
drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters, and will address an unmet critical need for cost effective drug
development by providing novel predictive tools for drug pharmacokinetics in humans.
Three specific aims are proposed. 1) New in vitro and mathematical methods will characterize the time-course
of cellular permeability and partitioning, to inform mechanisms underlying drug distribution, absorption, and
intracellular concentrations that drive drug clearance. Experiments in artificial membrane environments at
various pH values will define the pH partitioning – membrane permeability relationship. In vitro microdialysis
and transwell techniques will capture the time-course of drug partitioning into cells including MDCK, Caco-2,
adipocytes, and hepatocytes. Partitioning into erythrocyte glycocalyx will be measured. Resulting data will be
used as inputs to develop mathematical models to predict drug permeability across single vs. multiple
membranes across a cell, and drug partitioning into membranes. 2) Excipient effects on oral absorption will be
predicted in humans and rodents. Effect of excipient dose-dependent (Polysorbate 80 and PEG400) inhibition
of intestinal drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters (DMETs) will be evaluated with a refined rat intestinal
model. A continuous intestinal mouse absorption model will be developed and refined. The human and rat
intestinal models will be interfaced with species-specific PermQ models. 3) New in vitro and mathematical
methods will improve predictions of drug clearance. Rat data will be collected with microfluidics in hepatocytes
and in vivo, with regional drug quantification with MALDI imaging. Three standard liver models – well-stirred
(WSM), parallel-tube (PTM), and dispersion (DM) – will be evaluated within human and rat PermQ. Enzyme
zonation within the liver sinusoid will be modeled with both literature (discretized) and new partial differential
equation (continuous) methods."
10950466,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe form of lung injury requiring hospitalization in intensive
care and often invasive mechanical ventilation in effort to sustain life. ARDS can result from a variety of insults
(e.g. pneumonia, sepsis, trauma, and pancreatitis), posing broad risk to the public health. With the COVID-19
pandemic, ARDS has become a leading cause of death in the US and globally. Yet, even pre-pandemic, ARDS
occurred in 10% of US ICU admissions and had an associated mortality of 30-45%. Regardless of ARDS
etiology, many survivors experience cognitive, psychological, and physical impairments persisting years after
the acute illness resolves. Thus, there remains an urgent need to identify effective ARDS therapies. Invasive
mechanical ventilation is potentially life-saving, but can worsen lung injury and patient outcomes if not precisely
titrated to attenuate lung stress, which varies by patient with overdistension and atelectrauma (repetitive
opening/closure of potentially recruitable lung). Alveolar edema and atelectasis reduce the functional aerated
lung volume, such that tidal volume scaled to estimated healthy lung size (i.e. 6 mL/kg predicted body weight)
may not always prevent overdistension. Similarly, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is routinely increased
to recruit lung in patients with more severe hypoxemia, an approach that may exacerbate overdistension injury
in patients most susceptible. An integrated strategy that mitigates the competing risks of atelectrauma and
overdistension is needed. The range of lung stress observed in patients with ARDS receiving standard-of-care
ventilation is often larger than that observed in healthy adults due to perturbed lung and chest wall mechanics,
increasing risk of both atelectrauma and overdistension. In preclinical models and human cohort studies, lung
injury and mortality are less when the ventilator is set to maintain lung stress in the healthy normal range.
PREcision VENTilation to attenuate Ventilation-Induced Lung Injury (PREVENT VILI) is a phase III multicenter
randomized trial for adults with moderate-severe ARDS that tests whether precise ventilator titration to maintain
lung stress within 0-12 cm H2O, the healthy normal range during relaxed breathing, will improve patient outcomes
compared to guided usual care. In the precision ventilation arm, PEEP will be individualized to achieve lung
stress of 0 cm H2O at end-expiration, and tidal volume individualized to achieve driving pressure of 12 cm H2O
or the lowest possible. In the guided usual care arm, PEEP will be adjusted per usual care within limits set to
avoid practice extremes; tidal volume of 6-8 mL/kg predicted body weight will be targeted unless plateau pressure
exceeds 30 cm H2O, in which case tidal volume will be lowered. We will evaluate the effect of ventilator strategy
on 60-day mortality (Aim 1), lung injury (Aim 2), and hemodynamic instability (Aim 3). Findings will help determine
the role for individualizing ventilator support to reduce lung stress in ARDS and have potential to improve survival
from this leading cause of death worldwide."

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a debilitating psychiatric illness affecting 1-3% of the world population.
Although current therapeutic and pharmacological treatments provide some level of symptom relief, 40-60% of
OCD patients do not respond adequately to these approaches. Thus, a better understanding of the OCD neural
circuitry is much needed to develop new treatments. Recent studies show that combining non-human primate
(NHP) neuroanatomy with human neuroimaging allows for a precise anatomic-functional description of specific
brain circuits and pathways. In this application, Dr. Trambaiolli will use NHP neuroanatomy to evaluate specific
cortico-striatal connections relevant to avoidance symptoms in OCD. He will map precise connections between
these areas using NHP tract-tracing methods and translate these circuits to NHP and human functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) (Aim 1-K99). He will combine the connections mapped in Aim 1 with normative
modeling algorithms to identify connections within this circuit that deviate from normality and correlate with OCD
symptomatology (Aim 2-R00). This translational circuit will be targeted during a real-time fMRI neurofeedback
protocol, in which the participant will be trained to achieve voluntary control over specific functional connections.
First, this protocol will be optimized in healthy participants (K99). Later, the effects of neurofeedback control on
OCD symptoms will be evaluated in a single-group clinical trial (R00). Dr. Trambaiolli's prior training and
publication record indicate his expertise in real-time signal processing, machine learning, and quantitative
methods in neuroanatomy. To fully attain his research goals, however, he needs additional training in
translational models in psychopathologies (Core A), neuroimaging in clinical settings (Core B), and clinical
assessments and interventions (Core C). During the mentored phase, he will receive guidance from a mentoring
team led by Dr. Suzanne Haber, a translational neuroanatomist with experience in OCD circuitry (Core A and
B), and a Professor of Pharmacology and Physiology at the University of Rochester and a permanent Visiting
Professor at McLean Hospital – Harvard Medical School (HMS), Dr. Justin Baker, a clinical neuroscientist
experienced in NHP data analysis and biomarker discovery (Cores A and B), and the Scientific Director of the
McLean Institute for Technology in Psychiatry (ITP), Dr. Brian Brennan, a clinical scientist with expertise in OCD
biomarkers and interventions (Cores B and C), and the Medical Director of the OCD Institute (OCDI) at McLean,
and Dr. Darin Dougherty, a clinical scientist experienced in OCD biomarkers and the development of new device-
based therapies (Cores B and C), and the Director of the Division of Neurotherapeutics at the Massachusetts
General Hospital (MGH). The training and associated research will occur at McLean Hospital and HMS, a unique
environment dedicated to providing mental health care, research, and education. Dr. Trambaiolli will engage in
formal coursework, continue his training in translational neuroanatomy, perform fMRI data acquisition and
participate in clinical training. This award will give him a solid foundation for his independent research career."

Tuberculosis is a global disease affecting millions of people in primarily developing regions of the world. Central
nervous system tuberculosis (CNS-TB) is the most severe extra pulmonary form of the disease, which, despite
aggressive therapeutic intervention, can have a fatality rate of up to 80%. Significant barriers to understanding
disease pathogenesis exist, which translates to poor diagnosis and treatment outcomes. Thus, improved insight
into neuro-glial-immune cell interactions in CNS TB, and the factors that regulate brain pathology require a global
molecular and cellular perspective. Our long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms associated with
the development of CNS-TB, and different CNS-TB outcomes, in order to develop novel, effective, and
broadly accessible therapeutics. Single cell/nucleus RNA sequencing (sc/snRNA-seq) gene expression
analysis allows for a large-scale view of the cells and molecular pathways involved in neuropathogenesis, with
the potential to identify novel differences between TB diseased states. In this study, we will investigate
transcriptional changes induced by M. tuberculosis infection of the brain under clinical and experimental
conditions to determine how CNS-TB starts and progresses to different outcomes. This is made possible by
preliminary snRNA-seq data generated during our Global Brain R21 that we recently completed. We hypothesize
that M. tuberculosis invades the CNS due to the failed generation of an appropriate neuroimmune response in
CNS resident and peripherally recruited immune cells. This is strongly supported by our preliminary data from
human and rodent snRNA-seq studies. By exploring the transcriptional differences in cells from normal and
diseased states we will be able to identify the cell type-specific molecular and cellular processes that underpin
the pathogenesis of CNS-TB, including neuroinflammation and immune system engagement. Understanding
cell type-specific CNS and immune signaling in CNS-TB will enable us to develop novel therapies and
improve clinical outcomes. To test our central hypothesis, we will determine the molecular pathways across
CNS and immune cells that define clinical phenotypes in patients with CNS-TB and create a full disease spectrum
signaling framework of CNS-TB using multiple mouse models. In addition to our scientific aims, we will expand
the single cell gene expression analysis platform, established at the University of Cape Town (UCT) during our
Global Brain R21 support, to the broader African scientific community. We aim to provide training in project
planning, library preparation, and data analysis. When complete, we will have a novel understanding of the
cell type-specific inflammatory signaling events that drive CNS-TB and will be poised to engage novel
molecular targets to improve CNS-TB outcomes. Furthermore, UCT will be established as a hub of single
cell biology, to launch scientific careers of the next generation of African scientists, and to improve
health care across Africa."
10918309,"ABSTRACT
Anxiety and depression in caregivers of children are the most prevalent mental health problems in populations
in Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries and are a major public health challenge for which broad management
strategies currently do not exist. Caregiver mental health research in SSA has primarily focused on parents
and not teachers despite high prevalence of anxiety/depression reported in teachers. In Uganda (the location
of our proposed study), an estimated 28% of parents have mental health problems, and 25% of teachers have
anxiety/depression. Intervention to address caregivers’ and teachers’ mental health needs remains limited, in
part due to lack of resources and cost-effective population strategies. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop
mental health interventions that: 1) improve both teachers and parents stress management and reduce
prevalence of mental health problems; and 2) apply low-cost population strategies to improve accessibility of
the interventions in the broader school system. This proposal seeks to test the feasibility (R21 phase) and
effectiveness (R33 phase) of a new mHealth-App intervention, the mHealth Toolkit for Wellness & Empowering
Lives of School Community (mWEL) in Uganda. mWEL-App is an interactive preventive intervention tool for
teachers and parents as a self-help support modality. mWEL integrates three key mental health service
functions: i) comprehensive screen to assess mental health (anxiety, depression), stress, and related
contextual risks; ii) a tailored strength and weakness profile/report with recommendations to promote self-
awareness and mental health knowledge; and iii) tailored evidence-based strategies and additional support
and clinical resources to improve skills in stress management, emotion regulation, and maintain mental
wellness. To promote accessibility and to have broader population reach, mWEL will be embedded in the
education system and we will develop a sustainable approach to its implementation suited to local capacity and
policy. Specifically, we will apply a community and peer-empowered task-shifting approach to develop a
workforce for implementation. The Specific Aims are: (1) to build research and service capacity for digital and
public health approaches to improve caregivers’ mental health in schools; (2) to test and enhance usability of
the mWEL-T and P and to test feasibility and efficacy of both Toolkits in primary schools; (3) to test the
effectiveness of the optimized versions of mWEL using a cluster-randomized control trial (cRCT); and (4) to
identify big data analytic strategies for improving Digital-Toolkit decision support and precision mental health
care."
10741776,"Abstract I am seeking an R35 to address the fundamental issue of how right and left shifts in the O2
hemoglobin dissociation curve influence oxygen transport in humans. I am also proposing to translate key
findings to the treatment of diseases with specific defects in the O2 transport cascade like idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis and/or congestive heart failure. I am also proposing reverse translation from observations in patients
to more basic studies on O2 delivery and mitochondrial function. Hemoglobin is one of the sentinel molecules
responsible for the concept of “molecular medicine”. A central element of this paradigm is that when the
properties of the foundational molecular components of a system are understood, then more complex systems
phenomenon will be explained. However, “well-established” concepts about hemoglobin and whole body
oxygen transport are contradictory and deserve further scrutiny. The standard teaching is that in response to
hypoxia, there is an acute right shift in the O2 hemoglobin dissociation curve via the actions of 2,3-DPG. This
right shift facilitates the off-loading of oxygen at the tissues and protects against tissue hypoxia. However,
species adapted to high altitude via evolution have left shifted O2 hemoglobin dissociation curves. This
suggests that during hypoxia, loading more oxygen at the lung and relying on low tissue PO2 to maintain
oxygen transport is a better overall solution to the challenge of hypoxia. These divergent observations indicate
there is a complex set of context-dependent physiological “trade-offs” associated with shifts in O2 hemoglobin
dissociation curve and O2 delivery. In this application, I propose studying patients at the Mayo Clinic with rare
right and left shifted hemoglobin variants as unique “experiments in nature” that will allow exploration of these
trade-offs. Patient studies will be augmented with studies in healthy volunteers using repurposed drugs that
cause right and left shifts of the O2 hemoglobin dissociation curve. Insight from these studies will then be
translated to clinical populations. If tissue oxygenation is maintained in humans with left shifted curves, then
drugs that cause a left shift might be useful in patients with pulmonary diffusion limitation. This would permit
such patients to better oxygenate their blood at the lung with a lower FiO2 and reduced work of breathing.
Likewise, there is chronic tissue hypoxia in congestive heart failure that might be reduced by drugs that cause
a right shift in the O2 hemoglobin dissociation curve. These changes in O2 delivery might also evoke long term
changes in muscle mitochondrial function that will suggest follow-up reverse translation mechanistic studies.
Importantly, I am uniquely qualified to explore these ideas because of my: 1) access to unique patients, 2)
experience in drug re-purposing, 3) expertise in cardiorespiratory physiology, and 4) technical ability to
measure essentially every element of the O2 transport cascade in humans. Finally, because the R35
mechanism is designed to promote flexibility and risk taking by the PI, it is ideal to pursue this big issue and the
bi-directional translational opportunities that will flow from the experimental approach I have proposed."
10741786,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a hepatotropic DNA virus that replicates by reverse transcription. It chronically infects
about 290 million people and kills ~900,000 annually. Therapy primarily employs nucleos(t)ide analogs that target
the viral DNA polymerase (P), but only a few percent of patients clear the virus so therapy is life-long. Reverse
transcription is catalyzed by coordinate action of the viral DNA polymerase (RT) that synthesized the DNA and
the ribonuclease H (RNaseH) that destroys the RNA after it has been copied into DNA. The RT and RNaseH
comprise adjacent domains of P, and the 2 enzymatic activities are allosteric and/or kinetically linked during
replication. Newly synthesized HBV genomes have 3 fates: to become nuclear covalently closed circular DNA
(cccDNA) molecules, be secreted within virions, or be integrated into the cellular genome. P is also a regulatory
protein that accumulates at the endoplasmic reticulum and helps suppress interferon responses.
The role of the RT in HBV replication is fairly well understood, but very little is known about how the RNaseH
contributes to HBV biology. We recently expressed recombinant HBV RNaseH suitable for mechanistic analyses
and drug discovery for the first time. We then developed the first screening pipeline for HBV RNaseH inhibitors
and identified >130 compounds that block HBV replication by inhibiting the RNaseH. The recombinant RNaseH
and inhibitors are unique new tools to probe contributions of the RNaseH to viral biology.
Premise: Our recombinant HBV RNaseH, RNaseH inhibitors, and RNaseH assays enable studies to reveal
how the RNaseH contributes to viral biology and how the enzyme can evolve resistance to RNaseH inhibitors.
Aim 1. What are the effects of inhibiting the RNaseH on HBV reverse transcription? We will evaluate how
RNaseH inhibitors affect RNA encapsidation, the fate of the RNA during reverse transcription when the RNaseH
is inhibited, reversibility of damage to the viral genome induced by RNaseH inhibitors, how blocking the RNaseH
affects cccDNA synthesis, and the specific infectivity of virions made without RNaseH activity.
Aim 2. What is the potential for resistance to RNaseH inhibitors? We will select resistance mutations to
RNaseH inhibitors in cell culture and then define their effects on viral fitness and selectivity against inhibitors
from 3 chemotypes.
Aim 3. How does inhibiting the RNaseH affect capsids and HBV’s interaction with cells? We will define
how RNA:DNA heteroduplexes generated by inhibiting the RNaseH affect HBV capsids, the effects of RNA:DNA
heteroduplexes induced by RNaseH inhibitors on interferon responses, and how heteroduplexes made without
RNaseH activity affect integration of HBV DNA into the host genome.
These data will define how the HBV RNaseH contributes to viral biology. This information will deepen our
understanding of HBV’s interaction with cells and provide essential context for our ongoing development of
RNaseH inhibitors as novel drugs intended to improve therapy for chronically infected patients."
10741787,"ABSTRACT
New strategies to improve adoptive cell therapy (ACT) protocols are now emerging to enhance in vivo
persistence of adoptively transferred tumor epitope specific T cells and overcome tumor-induced
immunosuppression. Our preliminary data suggests that there is a direct correlation between the long-lived
central memory T cells (Tcm) and its anti-oxidant capacity. Overexpression of thioredoxin-1 (Trx), a key
molecule that regulates cell-surface thiols (c-SH), resulted in increased Tcm phenotype in T cells obtained from
TCR transgenic mouse crossbred with Trx transgenic mouse, or engineering human T cells with retroviral
vector with TCR and Trx together. Further, a quantification of the metabolites within Pmel vs. Pmel-Trx cells
showed that metabolites from pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP) and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA)
intermediate alpha-ketoglutarate (α-KG) were significantly higher in Pmel-Trx T cells as compared to Pmel
cells. While reductive intermediates generated by PPP are important to overcome oxidative stress, recent
reports have shown that α-KG is important in extending the cellular lifespan and regulating pluripotency of
stem cells. These preliminary observations lead us to hypothesize that “the presence of Trx drives tumor
reactive T cells to a c-SHhi phenotype, which not only exhibits enhanced anti-oxidant phenotype, but regulates
a combination of events including post-translational modifications, and epigenetic stability that lead to
metabolically fit anti-tumor T cells”. We propose the following specific aims: 1) To determine how the level of
thiol/thioredoxin on the surface of T cells regulates the generation of tumor reactive Tcm/Tscm cells in vivo, 2)
To determine how changes in the metabolic pathways and metabolites in T cells regulate the generation of
tumor reactive Tcm/Tscm in vivo, 3) To determine if modulation of reduced thiols and/or metabolites results in
generation of tumor reactive TCR transduced human T cells with functional memory phenotype. We believe
that our studies are innovative and will uncover important aspects that need to be considered when generating
tumor specific Tcm/Tscm cells for ACT."
10741789,"Cardiomyocytes (CMs) are building blocks and function units of the heart, and their dysfunction or loss
is the root of heart failure. Similar with other specialized innate immune cells, CMs have their own
innate immune molecular machinery. Ischemic or non-ischemic pathological stress activates CM
innate immune signaling pathways, which stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokine release and reactive
oxygen species (ROS) production. These innate immune responses are beneficial for defending CMs
against pathogen invasion and for tissue repair, but can also cause myocardial damage. The ultimate
goal of this project is to define new molecular mechanisms that regulate CM innate immune
responses, which will shed light on the pathogenesis of pathogen or non-pathogen related
cardiomyopathy. Damage/danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) initiate innate immune
responses by binding to pattern recognition receptors, and one of the best-characterized signaling axis
is TLR4/NF-kB pathway. The Hippo-YAP pathway is crucial for heart development and cardiac
regeneration, and disturbances in Hippo-YAP have been implicated in a range of heart diseases.
IRF2BP2 (interferon regulatory factor 2 binding protein 2) is a transcription co-factor little studied in the
heart. We recently found that YAP regulates CM innate immune responses by blunting TLR4/NF-kB
signaling, and that IRF2BP2 is crucial for restraining TLR4 expression in the heart. In this project, we
will test the hypothesis that YAP and IRF2BP2 are suppressors of CM innate immune responses. We
propose the following two aims. Aim 1. Define the role of YAP in CM innate immune responses. In this
aim, we will determine whether YAP regulation of CM innate immune responses depends on its
transcriptional activity. Additionally, we will develop a novel YAP modRNA delivery system. We
previously showed that transiently activating YAP with intra-myocardial delivered aYAP modRNA
reduced heart injury. However, the in situ delivery method limits aYAP modRNA's clinical application.
Here, we will test the efficacy of CM targeted and nano-particle packaged aYAP modRNA in a murine
cardiac ischemia/reperfusion model. Aim 2. Define the role of IRF2BP2 in CM innate immune
responses. In this aim, we will perform IRF2BP2 gain- and loss-of-function studies to define its role in
CM innate immune responses. Additionally, we will investigate the molecular mechanism of how
IRF2BP2 regulates CM innate immune responses. Using the new Irf2bp2 knock-in mouse line we
have recently generated, we will perform IRF2BP2 ChIP-Seq to identify its direct targets. This proposal
is innovative and significant, as it focuses on dissecting the basic molecular mechanisms that underlie
CMs innate immune responses, and it aims to develop new therapeutic strategies for reducing
myocardial infarction injury."
10742905,"Project Summary
 Myocardial infarction (MI) induces the massive death of cardiomyocytes. Quiescent cardiac fibroblasts
(CFs) are rapidly activated after MI. They proliferate and differentiate into cardiac myofibroblasts (CMFs),
mediating cardiac fibrosis. We recently found that in more stabilized infarct scar CMFs further differentiate into
matrifibrocytes, a state resembling partially differentiated chondrocytes, which indicated an advanced level of
fibrosis. The post-MI fibrotic response in the heart stabilizes the infarcted myocardium, which may prevent
cardiac rupture but also reduce ventricle wall compliance and conductivity, and even interfere with regeneration
efforts. Understanding the mechanisms regulating post-injury CF activities will help the development of treatment
strategies that enhance the beneficial effect of CFs and inhibit their deleterious effects. We found that in response
to MI the expression of runt-related transcription factor 1 (Runx1) in CFs increased significantly during both
myofibroblast and matrifibrocyte differentiation. Our preliminary study showed that Runx1 promoted CF
proliferation and inhibited their differentiation into myofibroblasts in vitro. In addition, we identified Ccn2 as a
potential target of Runx1. Ccn2 plays multiple roles in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation
through interacting with different cofactors. Thus, we hypothesize that Runx1 functions to balance the
proliferation and myofibroblast differentiation of CFs during the acute phase of MI and promote matrifibrocyte
differentiation in more stabilized infarct scars through direct targeting Ccn2, which is critical for maintaining tissue
integrity but also promotes adverse remodeling. In Aim #1, CF-specific tamoxifen-inducible Runx1 knockout (KO)
mice and wild type mice will be subjected to MI injury. Immunohistochemical staining, RNA-seq, and functional
assay will be employed to study the function of Runx1 in the proliferation, myofibroblast differentiation, and
matrifibrocyte differentiation of CFs after MI. In Aim #2, the mechanism through which Runx1 regulates the
expression of Ccn2 will be studied using CUT&RUN, ATAC-seq, Hi-C, and co-IP coupled to mass spectrometry.
The unbiased approach will also identify other direct and indirect targets of Runx1. In Aim #3, CF-specific
tamoxifen-inducible Ccn2 KO mice will be employed to compare the effect of Ccn2 KO and Runx1 KO on CF
proliferation and differentiation after MI. The requirement of Ccn2 in the regulation of CF proliferation and
differentiation by Runx1 will also be studied. The synergistic effect between Ccn2 and its cofactors, HB-EGF and
TGFβ3, on cardiac fibroblast proliferation and differentiation will be studied as well."

Disease Modifying Agents (DMAs) are vital for reducing inflammation and limiting disease activity in multiple
sclerosis (MS). However, there is a decline in inflammation and disease activity in older adults with MS due to
natural disease progression. In fact, most patients with MS over age 65 have very limited disease activity and
relapses. DMAs are not effective in preventing disability and disease progression associated with aging. There
is also very limited data on the effectiveness of DMAs in older adults with MS. Also, DMA use is associated with
increased infections, malignancy, and other adverse events. Continued DMA use in older adults is highly debated
due to no proven efficacy, safety concerns, and high prescription costs. Therefore, there is an urgent need to
evaluate the benefits and safety of DMA discontinuation in older adults. Although some studies with limited
samples found preliminary evidence for DMA discontinuation, no large-scale pharmacoepidemiological study
evaluated both the safety and effectiveness of DMA deprescribing in older adults. Our previous based study
found that older adults with MS received injectables (55%), followed by orals (32%). However, over 35% of older
adults discontinued their DMAs after 12 months. The overall goal of this research is to evaluate deprescribing
and associated effectiveness and safety outcomes in older adults with MS. The specific objectives of the
research are to: (1) examine DMA use and deprescribing in older adults with MS; (2) evaluate the effect of DMA
deprescribing on relapse rates and frailty; and (3) evaluate the effect of DMA deprescribing on serious infections
and all-cause mortality in older adults with MS. This study will involve a longitudinal national cohort of older adults
over 65 years of age with MS and DMA use based on ten-year Medicare claims data involving Parts A, B, and
D. The study will test the hypotheses that (i) there is no difference in relapse rates and frailty in older adults who
are deprescribed and those who continue DMA, (ii) and DMA deprescribing is associated with decreased
infection rates and all-cause mortality in older adults with MS. Deprescribing will be defined as the
discontinuation of DMAs for at least 12 months with a one-year baseline adherence of DMAs (proportion of days
covered of >0.80). The comparator group will be those continuing their DMAs. The relapse rates and frailty will
be operationalized using validated claims-based algorithms. The risk of serious infections and specific types of
infection, along with mortality, will also be evaluated. The study will involve a propensity score-matched cohort
design based on generalized boosted models to adjust for the selection bias within the multivariate context of
the Andersen Behavioral Model. Multivariable models within propensity score-matched sets will be used to
evaluate the effectiveness and safety outcomes. Multiple sensitivity analyses involving differing analytical
considerations will be conducted to assess the robustness of the findings. This will be the first national study to
provide valuable real-world evidence regarding DMA deprescribing and associated outcomes with significant
clinical and policy implications for improving prescribing practices and quality of care in older adults with MS."

This new R01 proposal explores novel mechanisms underlying RNA regulation in heart failure (HF), a major
global health concern with high morbidity and mortality. The PI is an advanced HF cardiologist, who studies
transcriptional regulation in HF and myocardial recovery. Based on data generated with support from the NIH
K08 program, we will explore new roles for DEAD-box RNA helicase 5 (Ddx5) in cardiac homeostasis and
disease. Ddx5 regulates virtually every step of RNA metabolism including alternative splicing, mRNA stability,
ribosome biogenesis, and translation, but the cardiac functions of Ddx5, the most highly expressed DEAD-box
RNA helicase in the human heart are unknown. Preliminary data from our laboratory showed Ddx5 was
downregulated in chronically failing human hearts and in hypertrophic mouse hearts. We demonstrated that mice
with cardiomyocyte-specific Ddx5 deletion (Ddx5-cKO) developed progressive lethal cardiomyopathy associated
with aberrant RNA splicing in key sarcomere genes, marked downregulation of dystrophin mRNA and protein,
and a significant reduction in cardiomyocyte contractility. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments identified an
interaction between Ddx5 and hnRNP H1 splicing factor in human and mouse cardiomyocytes. We propose to
test the novel hypothesis that dysregulation of Ddx5 signaling contributes to the pathogenesis of HF by disruption
of RNA splicing and downregulation of mRNA networks that are critical for cardiomyocyte function. In Aim 1, we
will determine the mechanisms by which Ddx5 regulates RNA splicing in cardiomyocytes. Using in vitro splicing
reporter assays, we will test whether the RNA splicing function of Ddx5 depends on target intronic sequences
and/or cooperation with hnRNP H1. We will generate mutant Ddx5 constructs to determine which domains are
critical for splicing regulation in vitro. eCLIP-sequencing and RNA immunoprecipitation-qPCR will identify direct
RNA splicing targets of Ddx5 in cardiomyocytes. In Aim 2, we will elucidate the mechanisms by which Ddx5
regulates cardiomyocyte contractility using luciferase assays, ChIP-qPCR, and proximity labeling mass
spectrometry to characterize the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory functions of Ddx5 in the heart.
To determine whether the HF phenotype of Ddx5-cKO mice is due to dystrophin deficiency, we will attempt to
rescue the phenotype in vivo using AAV-based mini-dystrophin gene therapy. In Aim 3, we will determine whether
Ddx5 overexpression protects mice from pathological cardiac remodeling by subjecting cardiac-specific Ddx5
transgenic and littermate control mice to pressure overload induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). As
an alternative in vivo Ddx5 overexpression strategy, we will assess the effects of TAC in wild-type mice treated
with AAV9-Ddx5 versus AAV9-eGFP vectors via tail vein injection. RNA and protein targets of Ddx5 will be
confirmed in human cardiomyocytes and heart tissue. These studies will provide new insights into RNA
metabolism and Ddx5 signaling in the heart under baseline and stress conditions, with potential implications for
novel therapies to treat the growing population of HF patients."
10932198,"Acute seizures may evolve into status epilepticus (SE), i.e., prolonged or repeated seizures without
regaining consciousness, resulting in irreversible brain injury or death costing ~$4 billion annually to the US
healthcare system. If seizures are treated rapidly with a correctly-dosed benzodiazepine (BZD), SE and its
associated morbidity and mortality may be averted. For instance, children treated after 10 minutes of seizure
onset are 11 times more likely to die during their hospitalization than patients treated earlier. Therefore, the
American Academy of Neurology identified time to treatment as a quality metric to evaluate SE care. Despite
these evidence-based recommendations, delayed seizure treatment remains the status quo in many centers.
 The Quality Improvement in Time to Treatment of Status Epilepticus (QuITT-SE) study will examine the
implementation and effects of a standardized set of QI interventions across pediatric hospitals with diversity in
geography, patient demographics and resources. The proposed interventions were developed and tested in a
single-center study that doubled the number of SE episodes treated within guideline timing, decreased morbidity,
and mitigated over $2 million of charges in the following 17-month period. Our overarching goal is to study the
implementation of these QI interventions and their effect on time to SE treatment across multiple centers utilizing
an effectiveness-implementation hybrid design. The QuITT-SE trial will be a stepped-wedge cluster randomized
trial across multiple sites within the Pediatric Status Epilepticus Research Group, an established consortium of
hospitals with expertise in studying and treating SE in children. During this project, mixed qualitative and
quantitative methods will be used to identify implementation factors related to the interventions. In addition, the
use of standardized QI processes within the Practical, Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM)
will facilitate the identification of site-specific drivers and themes pertaining to delayed SE treatment, improving
the generalizability of findings.
 The specific aims are: 1) Primary: Determine how implementing a QI bundle impacts the time to treat
SE among hospitalized, non-critically ill children. 2a) Secondary: Determine the effect on Pediatric Cerebral
Performance Category score among hospitalized, non-critically ill children after implementing a QI bundle. 2b)
Secondary: Determine the effect of dissemination of a QI bundle on cost of hospitalization for SE among
hospitalized, non-critically ill children 3) Exploratory: Explore the factors implicated in implementing a QI bundle
on the time to treat SE among hospitalized children.
 Public Health Impact: Each year, SE results in an estimated 15,000-45,000 deaths in children in the US
and costs ~$4 billion, increasing markedly with more prolonged seizures. Successful completion of QuITT-SE
will produce a set of evidence-based interventions alongside an implementation framework to improve outcomes
and value of SE treatment across diverse hospital settings."
10890172,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 The impaired clearance of neuropathological proteins has been increasingly recognized in Alzheimer's
disease (AD). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow plays an essential role in the waste clearance process of the brain,
and disruptions of CSF flow are implicated in AD. However, most of the studies on CSF clearance were
conducted in animals, and the CSF flow dynamics and clearance pathways in the human brain remain poorly
understood. Most of the human studies on brain CSF flow are only able to investigate flow dynamics in ventricles
or in the aqueduct so far due to the lack of sufficient imaging tools, and little is known about CSF flow in the key
regions for clearance—subarachnoid space (SAS) and perivascular space (PVS). This poses a major barrier to
studying brain-wide CSF flow dynamics and clearance pathways as well as their correlation with aging and AD
pathology, which are essential steps toward understanding the clearance process of toxic proteins in AD.
To overcome this barrier, the goal of this proposal is to develop the first whole-brain MR CSF flowmetry
that extends the imaging area from ventricles to previously inaccessible SAS and PVS, and apply it to investigate
the alteration of brain-wide CSF flow in aging and AD, and its correlation with neuropathological protein
deposition. The flowmetry technique will provide unparalleled sensitivity, specificity, efficiency, and
spatiotemporal resolution to map SAS/PVS CSF flow in the human brain. Using this tool, we will answer key
questions about brain-wide SAS/PVS flow dynamics and pathways as well as their driving factors in the human
brain. We will then study how CSF flow dynamics change with healthy aging and how they are disrupted in AD
patients, especially how flow stagnation correlates with amyloid-beta and tau deposition using MR flowmetry
combined with PET imaging. The outcome of this study will significantly advance our knowledge of brain
clearance in aging and AD, and lay the foundation for future investigation of CSF-flow-based imaging biomarkers
and therapeutic interventions for AD to improve clinical outcomes.
The candidate has in-depth training in neuroimaging, MR physics and state-of-the-art MR methodology,
and signal processing. He is seeking additional training in Alzheimer's disease, translational research skills, and
multi-model imaging analysis from this grant mechanism, to achieve his long-term career goal to become an
independent investigator in neuroimaging of neurodegenerative diseases, and establish research programs that
develop innovative neuroimaging technologies, apply them to advance our understanding of aging and
neurodegeneration, and translate these technologies to facilitate the discovery of non-invasive imaging
biomarkers and aid in the development of therapeutic interventions of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.
He will work with a multi-disciplinary team of mentors and collaborators who are world-renowned experts in their
respective fields, and leverage the exceptional resources at Massachusetts General Hospital to achieve his
scientific and career development goals."

 High-grade serous ovarian cancer has the highest mortality rate of all gynecologic cancers. There is a
critical unmet need to identify new therapeutic targets and therapeutic approaches that will improve outcomes
for women with chemo-resistant ovarian cancer. Deficiencies in the DNA damage response (DDR) can drive
increased tumor immunogenicity, which leads to enhanced responses to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.
PP4 is a multi-subunit phosphatase complex that plays a central role in the response to DNA damage through
the dephosphorylation of many proteins that play crucial roles in the DDR. However, the role of PP4 in cancer
development, chemoresistance, and anti-tumor immunity is currently unknown. The central hypothesis is that
PP4 inhibition will sensitize OC cells to chemotherapy-mediated immunogenicity leading to enhanced anti-
tumor immunity, and increased response to immune checkpoint blockade. The rationale for the proposed
research is that understanding of the how the immune response is activated in reaction to deficiencies in PP4-
mediated DNA damage repair has the potential to translate into new therapeutic strategies that will benefit
those with ovarian cancer. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following two specific aims: 1)
Determine the role of the PP4 complex in the immunogenicity of OC; and 2) Determine the role of PP4 in
tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte recruitment, function, and response to immunotherapy. In Aim 1 the effect of PP4
knockout on chemotherapy-induced immunogenicity will be assessed using mechanistic studies of genomic
instability, antigen presentation, and immunogenic cell death. Under the second Aim the effect of PP4
deficiency combined with PD-1 inhibition and chemotherapy will be evaluated in organoid cultures of primary
human ovarian cancer and in two immunocompetent mouse models of ovarian cancer. Mechanisms of
inflammatory signaling will be investigated. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it
represents a new theoretical concept by shifting the focus on PP4 function to its role in anti-tumor immunity.
The proposed research is significant because it is predicted to advance and expand our understanding of the
importance of how DNA damage repair resolution contributes to anti-tumor immunity and response to
immunotherapy. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to inform the development of new therapies
benefiting many types of cancer."

Staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen responsible for a wide range of life-threatening infections.
Many of these infections are caused by methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA). MSSA represent a major
burden among S. aureus infections and are important contributors to mortality. For decades, the first line of
therapy for severe MSSA infections have been the isoxazolyl-penicillins (ISP, e.g., nafcillin). However, recent
data suggest that clinical outcomes in MSSA bacteremia are similar in patients treated with cefazolin (vs
nafcillin), a cephalosporin with activity against MSSA that appears to be less toxic. Indeed, treatment with nafcillin
seems to be associated with increased costs, more drug reactions (including hepatotoxicity, interstitial nephritis
and neutropenia) and, possibly, higher mortality. Due to these concerns, an important shift in the treatment of
MSSA is occurring whereby clinicians are now using cefazolin as first line of therapy for severe MSSA
infections. An important concern of using cefazolin and other cephalosporins as primary therapy for these serious
infections is the cefazolin inoculum effect (CzIE), defined as a cefazolin minimal inhibitory concentration of >
16 µg/ml when a high inoculum (107 CFU/ml) is used. The CzIE has been associated with failures in the treatment
of deep-seated MSSA infections and with the production of certain isotypes of the staphylococcal β-lactamase.
However, the characterization of the clinical impact of this phenomenon in deep-seated MSSA infections
is limited. In addition, it is currently not possible to detect the CzIE in a standard clinical microbiology laboratory
given the cumbersome and expensive nature of the gold standard test for its detection. Our published and
preliminary clinical data suggest that the CzIE is an important contributor to worse clinical outcomes of severe
MSSA infections. Furthermore, we have developed and published a novel colorimetric nitrocefin-based rapid test
(~3 h) that detects the CzIE with high sensitivity and specificity that can be incorporated in the routine clinical
microbiology laboratory. We postulate that, i) the CzIE negatively impacts clinical outcomes in MSSA bacteremia
treated with cefazolin and, ii) a rapid test can be readily implemented for the identification of the CzIE in S.
aureus bacteremia and can detect patients at higher risk of poor outcomes. In order to address these hypotheses,
we will take advantage of the Staphylococcus aureus Network Adaptive Platform (SNAP) trial, a multicenter,
pragmatic, multi-arm, open-label adaptive platform trial addressing multiple therapeutic questions in patients with
S. aureus bacteremia. We will focus in the MSSA “domain” that evaluates the effectiveness and safety of
cefazolin vs ISP in a randomized fashion, currently enrolling in Australia, Singapore, Canada, Israel, New
Zealand, United Kingdom, United States, Colombia and Chile. The specific aims of our proposal are: i) to define
the clinical impact of the CzIE in MSSA bacteremia and, ii) to determine the clinical value and feasibility of a
rapid test to detect the CzIE. Our findings are likely to transform the treatment approach for MSSA infections and
will provide the basis to develop novel diagnostic tools to the management of MSSA infections."

The olfactory epithelium is one of three major regions within the mammalian nervous system where new neurons are
added throughout life. In humans, a failure to maintain olfactory sensory neurogenesis is associated with olfactory
dysfunction, which afflicts an estimated 12.4 percent of adults in the U.S. and can adversely affect health and quality
of life. A key barrier to treating olfactory dysfunction is our incomplete understanding of how persistent olfactory
sensory neurogenesis is regulated and maintained. A related deficiency lies in our understanding of why neurogenesis
persists within the olfactory epithelium. Life-long olfactory sensory neurogenesis is presumed to function solely to
replace damaged olfactory sensory neurons. However, work from our laboratory has demonstrated that the birthrates
of neurons that express a fraction of odorant receptors are accelerated upon stimulation by specific odors, leading to
the central hypothesis of this proposal: that persistent neurogenesis within the olfactory epithelium serves, in part, an
adaptive function. Our results are not readily explained by the current model of olfactory sensory neurogenesis, which
predicts that the relative birthrates of neurons expressing each of the hundreds of different receptor genes encoded in
the genome are determined stochastically by a process in which each post-mitotic neural precursor randomly ‘chooses’
a single odorant receptor gene for expression. Accordingly, the relative birthrates of distinct olfactory sensory neuron
‘subtypes’ are expected to be impervious to olfactory experience. The overall objective of this proposal is to determine
how odor stimulation selectively accelerates the birthrates of specific olfactory sensory neuron subtypes. Our working
model is that a fraction of subtypes have a special capacity, upon stimulation by odors with potential salience, to
amplify themselves by selectively promoting the proliferation of mitotic neural progenitors that are of the same lineage
and predisposed toward the same subtype fate. This model will be tested through three specific aims. Aim 1 will test
the hypothesis that olfactory stimuli that selectively promote the neurogenesis of specific neuron subtypes are discrete,
salient odors that selectively stimulate those subtypes. This will be tested by identifying, via a selective single-cell
sequencing-based approach, the scope of neuron subtypes whose birthrates are accelerated by sex-specific odors. Aim
2 will test the hypothesis that some mitotic neural progenitors are predisposed toward specific odorant receptor fates
that can be selectively amplified via cell proliferation. This will be tested by mapping the subtype fates of individual
progenitors using genetic barcoding and in situ sequencing strategies. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that mature olfac-
tory sensory neurons of specific subtypes have a special capacity to promote the proliferation of progenitors within the
same lineage via odor stimulation-dependent signaling. This will be tested through functional analyses of genes that
have been found to be selectively expressed by neuron subtypes that undergo stimulation-dependent neurogenesis. The
proposed experiments are expected to elucidate key aspects of persistent olfactory sensory neurogenesis, including
how it is regulated, why it occurs, and how it may be manipulated to enhance human health."

Diffuse gliomas are the most common primary malignant brain tumors in adults. Existing therapies provide only
modest benefits, so there is a pressing need for new treatment strategies. Genetic studies of gliomas have
identified a number of recurrent mutations, inspiring many important efforts to develop targeted treatments.
Nevertheless, because it is uncertain when or if these efforts will succeed, it is critical to expand the therapeu-
tic search space for gliomas. Like all cancers, mutations that cause gliomas transform cellular identity by alter-
ing gene expression. However, the transcriptional phenotypes that distinguish malignant glioma cells and cells
of the glioma microenvironment from cells in the normal adult human brain remain poorly understood. This pro-
ject will use novel analytical and experimental strategies to precisely define the transcriptional phenotypes that
most reliably distinguish malignant and non-malignant cell classes in glioma from cells in the normal adult hu-
man brain. Our central hypothesis is that integrative gene coexpression analysis of intact tissue samples can
reveal the core transcriptional identities of distinct cell classes in gliomas, thereby highlighting the impact of
glioma genotypes on gene expression. In Aim 1, we will perform meta-analysis and integrative deconvolution
of transcriptomes from >4K intact tissue samples from astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, and glioblastomas to
distill transcriptional profiles of distinct cell classes. We will compare cell class-specific transcriptional signa-
tures between gliomas and normal brains and validate predicted differences histologically. In Aim 2, we will
determine the most consistent molecular phenotypes of IDH1 R132H+ malignant cells in lower-grade gliomas
by analyzing covariation of mutant allele frequencies and molecular features over serial sections of frozen tu-
mor specimens. We will validate predictions histologically and through comparisons with normal human brain.
In Aim 3, we will perform multiscale and multiomic analysis of subclonal diversity in spatially mapped subre-
gions of lower-grade gliomas. We will validate subclonal diversity and transcriptional phenotypes through tar-
geted single-nucleus RNA-seq. Collectively, these experiments will provide fundamental insights into molecular
mechanisms that promote gliomagenesis and substantially expand the therapeutic search space for adult ma-
lignant gliomas."

The increasing rates of obesity and diabetes highlight the need to understand the brain circuits and cellular
mechanisms regulating energy balance and glucose homeostasis. Prominent among these is the central leptin-
melanocortin system, which includes the pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons, subsets of which express
leptin receptors (LEPRs). While enormous strides have been made to understand the role of hypothalamic
POMC neurons that produce α-MSH in metabolism, relatively little is known about how the three isoforms of -
MSH produced in hypothalamus and pituitary gland POMC-expressing cells respond to metabolic challenges.
The current application extends our previous discovery that LEPR-expressing POMC neurons are required for
coordinating hepatic glucose production and responding to metabolic challenges. We will determine the roles
for -MSH peptides produced from POMC neurons in the regulation of metabolism in dynamic challenges. This
project is also significant because it will be the first to combine the power of mouse genetics with advanced
mass spectrometry to quantitatively measure and map specific POMC-derived -MSH peptides in
hypothalamic and pituitary tissues. We will also correlate -MSH peptide levels with parameters of energy and
glucose homeostasis, and deermine which peptides underlie metabolic adaptation. These studies will broaden
our understanding of the functional mechanism by which the leptin-melanocortin system regulates endocrine
and autonomic functions, particularly at the level of liver and adipose tissues."

 This K08 award will establish Christopher Worsham, MD, MPH as a clinician-investigator health
services researcher examining critical care services and their value using advanced methods of causal
inference. Dr. Worsham is an Instructor in Medicine, pulmonologist, and critical care physician at Harvard
Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital. Building on his clinical training, prior research
experience, and coursework in quantitative methods, this award will allow him to develop expertise in (1)
advanced methods of causal inference using large administrative datasets, (2) inter-hospital critical care
transport services with an emphasis on acute respiratory failure (ARF), and (3) decision science and cost-
effectiveness analysis. To achieve these goals, Dr. Worsham has assembled a team with expertise in: health
services research and advanced methods of causal inference (Drs. Anupam Jena, Mary Beth Landrum,
Hannah Wunsch, and Bruce Landon); critical care medicine and ARF (Dr. Taylor Thompson); critical care
transport in ARF (Dr. Susan Wilcox); and decision science and cost-effectiveness analysis (Dr. Ankur Pandya).
 The inter-hospital transfer of critically ill patients is a common practice in the U.S. critical care system,
generally done to move patients to hospitals with intensive care unit (ICU) resources commensurate with the
severity of their acute illness. However, we do not fully understand current national practice patterns of inter-
hospital ICU transfer across diverse patient populations. We also lack robust estimates of clinical benefits or
value of using particularly costly air ambulance services to rapidly move ICU patients between hospitals,
including those with ARF, the most common reason for ICU admission.
 To address these important questions in the critical care system, Dr. Worsham will analyze data from
two large insurance claims databases, Medicare and the MarketScan commercial insurance claims database.
In Aim 1, he will characterize current practices and risk factors associated with inter-hospital ICU transfer in
the overall adult ICU population. In Aim 2, focusing on patients with ARF, he will estimate the effect of air
compared to ground inter-hospital transport using a novel instrumental variables approach that accounts for
unmeasured confounding by taking advantage of the random weather conditions that push patients to travel by
ground rather than air. In Aim 3, he will use methods of decision science to perform a cost-effectiveness
analysis of air compared to ground inter-hospital transport of patients with ARF to inform high-value care. This
work and training will provide him the basis for a future R01 proposal that examines common and costly
practices that impact patients as they move through the U.S. critical care system using advanced methods of
causal inference and cost-effectiveness analysis. This K08 and future R01 will inform bedside decision making
and policy surrounding resource allocation and high-value care in the U.S. critical care system."
10863989,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 It is well-established that neural activity in the rodent gustatory cortex (GC) encodes taste, taste-predictive
cues and taste-guided decisions. These neural signals play an important role in guiding behaviors related to
taste and consumption. Recent electrophysiological and imaging studies demonstrated that GC can also process
interoceptive information pertaining to the homeostatic control of feeding and drinking, with hunger/satiety and
thirst/quenching affecting neural activity on both the slow time scale of ongoing activity and the fast time scale
of taste- and cue-evoked activity. The GC circuits and neurochemicals involved in processing interoceptive
signals as well as their role in driving specific behavioral responses are not fully understood yet.
 We propose to address this gap by focusing on a neuropeptide, the gastrin-releasing peptide, (GRP), and a
GC population of neurons producing GRP. As GRP is a feeding-suppressing peptide, neurons expressing GRP
(GRP+) are ideal candidates to sense homeostatic states and mediate the effects of GC on consumption. Our
preliminary data show that GC GRP+ neurons project to the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) – a
nucleus known for its role in mediating aversive and appetitive behaviors – corroborating the idea that this
population of cells may indeed control behavior and lead to meal termination.
 The experiments in this proposal we will test the overarching hypothesis that GC GRP+ neurons process
interoceptive homeostatic signals at both the slow and fast temporal scales of ongoing and taste/cue-
evoked activity, and are capable of inhibiting consumption. Anatomical and immunohistological methods,
in vitro patch clamp electrophysiology, 2-photon (2P) calcium imaging in behaving mice, and
optogenetic/pharmacological manipulations will be used to address the following specific aims: Aim #1 will rely
on anatomical methods, patch clamp and optogenetics to establish neurochemical identity, electrophysiological
properties, laminar distribution and connectivity of GC GRP+ neurons. The studies will test the hypothesis that
GC GRP+ neurons are excitatory neurons sending projections to BLA and that GRP released by these neurons
modulates the activity of BLA circuits. Aim #2 will use 2P calcium imaging to study the activity patterns of GRP+
and GRP- neurons in mice engaged in behavioral tasks probing taste and anticipatory-cues processing under
distinct homeostatic conditions. These experiments will test the hypothesis that activity of GC GRP+ neurons,
and specifically those projecting to BLA, integrate sensory signals related to nutrients (taste and cues) with
homeostatic signals related to meal termination. Finally, Aim #3 will rely on optogenetic activation at different
time scales to establish the behavioral contribution of GC GRP+ neurons and investigate the neurochemical
bases of this effect. The experiments will test the hypothesis that GC GRP+ neurons provide a meal termination
signal, and that their projection to BLA mediates, at least in part, the control of feeding behavior.
 Altogether, the proposed experiments will establish a new research avenue on the GC and GCBLA circuits
involved in representing interoceptive signals and guiding homeostatic behaviors. If successful, these study will
i) enhance our understanding of the function of the gustatory cortex; ii) unveil a new role for cortical GRP within
the GRPBLA axis; iii) establish a model for studying peptidergic transmission in cortico-amygalar circuits. The
results will have important consequences for our understanding of the role of GC in ingestive behaviors."

 This application is entitled ‘Anatomical regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism by insulin
signaling in hepatocytes’. The liver is a multitasking organ, performing diverse functions that are critical for
maintaining glucose and lipid homeostasis. Previous studies of hepatic insulin signaling have been done with
the assumption that all hepatocytes are equivalent. Recently single-cell transcriptomics has revealed that
around half of hepatocyte genes are expressed in a zoned manner, in which periportal hepatocytes might
coordinate fasting metabolism, whereas pericentral hepatocytes might manage postprandial metabolism. A
clear understanding of how insulin signaling coordinates energy homeostasis at spatial levels is necessary.
 This proposal brings our focus to the important problem of how anatomical segregation of insulin signaling
in the liver regulates glucose and lipid metabolism in physiological and pathological conditions. By using
promoter knock-in mouse models, we will perform the functional study in vivo by using Gls2CreER mouse line to
target periportal hepatocytes and Cyp1a2CreER mouse line to target pericentral hepatocytes. This real-time
molecular strategy is innovative as previous work that has relied upon static approaches. By intercrossing with
floxed mice targeting insulin signaling components, this project has the potential to reveal important insight into
the anatomical segregation of insulin signaling in the liver to control energy homeostasis. First, impaired insulin
signal transduction in periportal hepatocytes is expected to promote hepatic glucose production but might
retain insulin sensitivity in pericentral hepatocytes for lipid metabolism, producing the pathological combination
of hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. This strategy might provide an innovative model to investigate the
metabolic features of insulin resistance in humans. Second, our preliminary data shows that total hepatic
insulin signaling deficiency impairs hepatic de novo lipogenesis and prevents diet-induced fatty liver in mice,
which contradicts the excess lipogenesis in insulin-resistant humans. Direct investigation of insulin signaling in
pericentral hepatocytes can reveal the relationship between insulin resistance and NAFLD. Third, selective
insulin resistance has implications for therapy; however, how to precisely target this paradox is still unresolved.
It would be desirable to employ drug targets that could alleviate both T2D and NAFLD. Thus, we propose to
identify novel candidate genes that contribute to HFD-induced hyperglycemia and hepatic steatosis.
 Together, the proposed experiments can discern the function of insulin signaling in the regulation of
glucose and lipid metabolism in the periportal and pericentral hepatocytes, which would reveal foundational
mechanisms coordinated by hepatic insulin action that moderate glucose and lipid metabolism under
physiological and pathological conditions."
10864002,"Project Summary and Relevance.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a worldwide health problem. It is estimated that there are 200 to 500 million
HBV chronic carriers in the world for whom, to date, there is no reliable treatment. HBV causes both acute and
chronic liver disease and is responsible for an estimated one million deaths annually. Currently available
therapies reduce viral loads but fail to resolve chronic HBV infections. Therefore, effective treatments for chronic
HBV infection are urgently required. The major obstacle to the resolution of chronic HBV infections is the
eradication or inactivation of nuclear HBV covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA which is the template for viral
transcription. To this end, we have developed HNF1α-null HBV transgenic mice and liver-specific Tet-deficient
HBV transgenic mice. HNF1α-null HBV transgenic mice synthesize nuclear HBV cccDNA, a fraction of which is
extensively methylated in adult mice. Liver-specific Tet-deficient HBV transgenic mice are viable, essentially
display normal liver physiology, but lack detectable HBV transcription and replication (i.e. they are effectively
“cured”) suggesting Tet is also essential for viral biosynthesis. The observation that Tet-deficient HBV transgenic
mice fail to support HBV biosynthesis is consistent with the suggestion that Tet is essential for the developmental
demethylation of HBV genomic DNA which epigenetically governs HBV transcription by modulating viral
chromatin structure in vivo. Defining the precise temporal requirements for Tet expression associated with HBV
transcription and replication will indicate the liver developmental stages when viral biosynthesis is susceptible to
inhibition by Tet deficiency. This will be achieved by modulating Tet expression using our recently developed
tamoxifen-inducible Tet-deficient HBV transgenic mouse model system. Using this system, the developmental
control of HBV transcription, viral biosynthesis and HBV DNA methylation by Tet expression will be established
and correlated with the epigenetic histone marks and chromatin structure associated with the HBV genome.
Similar studies will be performed using the HNF1α-null Tet-deficient HBV transgenic mouse model of chronic
viral infection so the developmental control of HBV transcription, viral biosynthesis, HBV DNA methylation,
epigenetic histone marks and chromatin structure by Tet expression associated with the HBV genome can be
compared between the HBV transgene DNA and the nuclear HBV cccDNA. Finally, the development of HBV
transgenic mice supporting viral biosynthesis exclusively from extrachromosomal genomic DNA, a more
physiologically relevant mouse model of chronic viral infection, will be developed so the effect of Tet-deficiency
on HBV biosynthesis derived solely from HBV cccDNA can be determined. Defining the molecular signals
responsible for the loss of HBV biosynthesis due to Tet deficiency may lead to the identification of cellular
therapeutic targets, including but not restricted to Tet proteins, that are amenable to the development of novel
small molecular weight therapeutic inhibitors to resolve rather than simply treat chronic HBV infection."

Currently recommended strategies for primary maintenance of bone mass with age are limited to consuming a
diet rich in vitamins and minerals and performing weight bearing activity. Without more specific and effective
ways to maintain bone mass with age, older adults will develop osteoporosis and elevated fracture risk
necessitating prescription drugs, with side effects and restrictive costs. Hence, there is an unmet need for safe
and effective dietary interventions for the metabolic processes underlying bone loss. Our long term goal is to
develop safe and effective prebiotic/probiotic combination supplements for the dietary management of the
metabolic processes underlying osteopenia and osteoporosis. The objective of this project is to test the efficacy
of an probiotic/prebiotic combination (“synbiotic”) on the skeleton in a clinical trial that is designed to provide
mechanistic insights into the action of the synbiotic. Our central hypothesis is that a novel plant-derived medical
food synbiotic (“SBD111”) will improve dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) derived lumbar spine bone
mineral density (BMD), quantitative computed tomography (QCT) derived bone strength — aka Biomechanical
Computed Tomography analysis, or BCT— and volumetric BMD (vBMD), markers of bone turnover,
inflammation, and gut microbiome function in older women (>60 years) compared to placebo. Guided by strong
preliminary data this hypothesis will be tested by performing an 18-month randomized, double-blinded, placebo-
controlled clinical trial in 220 older women. Our specific aims are: Aim 1a and 1b To determine the effect of 18
months of daily intake of SBD111 on the primary outcome of lumbar spine DXA-BMD and secondary outcomes
(BCT-derived vertebral compressive bone strength, vBMD, and markers of bone turnover) in women. Aim 2a
and 2b To determine the effect of 18 months of daily intake of SBD111 on markers of inflammation and gut
microbiome function in women. We will employ whole metagenome and meta-transcriptome shotgun sequencing
to dissect changes in gut microbiome function [defined as changes in glycosyl hydrolase, menaquinone 7, short
chain fatty acid (SCFA), and microbial diversity], which can mediate the effect of SBD111 on bone turnover and
inflammation. We will also consider intake of total dietary fiber, prebiotic fiber, and probiotic foods that could
modify the effect of SBD111 on bone, inflammation, and gut microbiome.
If successful, this proposed trial will lead to developing potentially safe, inexpensive health promoting strategies
for the dietary management of the metabolic processes underlying osteopenia and osteoporosis.

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a lipid-carrying particle that contributes significantly to cardiovascular disease risk when
at elevated levels (estimated 30% of the population), but has limited options for therapy, especially for primary
prevention. Anti-platelet therapy with aspirin has become controversial for the primary prevention of
cardiovascular events, but people with elevated Lp(a) may represent a subgroup that derives benefit due to the
unaddressed risk associated with elevated Lp(a), Lp(a)’s interaction with platelets, and Lp(a)’s interaction with
fibrinolysis which may result in lower overall bleeding risk. This proposal seeks to address the hypothesis that
daily low-dose aspirin therapy will reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events in people with
elevated Lp(a). We will perform secondary analyses of the ASCEND trial of diabetic participants (Aim 1) and the
ASPREE trial of healthy elderly participants (Aim 2) by measuring Lp(a) on stored blood samples and evaluating
the effect of aspirin therapy on ASCVD events by Lp(a) level while preserving randomization. Additionally, we
similarly aim to evaluate this hypothesis in multi-ethnic American prospective cohort studies (Aim 3) to study a
population with enhanced ethnic diversity that is more reflective of the population in the United States and
worldwide. Preliminary data using genetic polymorphisms from the ASPREE trial provides robust evidence of an
anticipated benefit of aspirin therapy for primary prevention in people with elevated Lp(a). I have expertise in
internal medicine, cardiology, epidemiology, and statistics. My career goal is to become an independent
investigator in preventive cardiology with a focus on epidemiology, risk stratification and preventive therapies in
association with thrombosis and lipid disorders, particularly Lp(a). This award and the described career
development plan will allow me to achieve these goals by completing the proposed studies and by building on
my previously established foundation by completing the training plan to further develop skills in lipidology,
biostatistics and genetic epidemiology. Through this plan, I will develop the tools to ask novel questions related
to lipidology using advanced methods in epidemiology and biostatistics. UC San Diego is a world-renown
academic institution with an incredible array of resources for completing this training and performing research,
as well as collaborators in every possible field to work with. Additionally, as an Assistant Professor, the Division
of Cardiology has committed to supporting my research career by providing me with 75% protected research
team, dedicated office space and startup funding to conduct research ($25,000 per year) through a KL2 grant."

Despite the tremendous efforts in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) research, we have not made much progress in
understanding the pathophysiology of AD or inhibiting/correcting AD-related behavioral symptoms. The recent
FDA-approved aducanumab demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing amyloid β (Aβ). Still, it showed a
limited effect in improving AD-related memory impairments. The specific neural circuits that mediate these
cognitive processes but are altered progressively in the AD brains may serve as a treatment target after the
removal of Aβ plaques. In my previous studies, I demonstrated that dorsal Raphe nucleus (DRN) serotonin (5-
HT) neurons provide monosynaptic inputs to the hippocampal ventral CA1 (vCA1). Further, genetic ablation of
5-HT synthesis selectively in these vCA1-projecting DRN neurons impaired spatial memory in young mice. In
addition, genetic deletion of the 5-HT 2C receptor (5-HT2CR) in the vCA1 led to spatial memory deficits in young
mice. I also observed that lorcaserin, a selective agonist of 5-HT2CR, can ameliorate spatial memory deficits in
a 6-month-old knock-in AD mouse model (APPNL-G-F), associated with restoration of synaptic plasticity in vCA1
neurons. Together, I developed a hypothesis that a 5-HTergic DRN to vCA1 circuit regulates spatial memory via
5-HT2CR, a therapeutic target for memory symptoms in Alzheimer’s disease. The K99 phase will focus on the
upstream node of this circuit, the vCA1-projecting 5-HT neurons. Fiber photometry experiments will be used to
monitor the real-time activity of these vCA1-projecting 5-HT neurons, as well as 5-HT release in the vCA1,
corresponding to memory acquisition and retrieval behaviors. The intersectional retrograde chemogenetic
approach will be used to further test whether inhibition of the vCA1-projecting 5-HT neurons would inhibit memory
function and whether activating these neurons would rescue memory impairments in APPNL-G-F mice and aged
mice. During the R00 phase, I will utilize the techniques and the problem-solving experience I acquire from the
K99 phase to test the functional significance of the downstream 5-HT2CR-expressing vCA1 neurons. I will use
fiber photometry to monitor the activity of 5-HT2CR-expressing vCA1 neurons during the memory test and will
use the chemogenetic approach to assess the functional relevance of these neurons in memory function. In
addition, I will also test the combination treatment of Aβ-lowering (aducanumab) and 5-HT2CR agonism
(lorcaserin) in APPNL-G-F mice and aged mice. The proposed studies will advance our knowledge of the circuitry
mechanisms underlying memory function and evaluate the possibility of 5-HT2CR agonism as a novel therapeutic
target for AD in combination with Aβ-reducing medications. In addition, the K99 phase will provide an ideal
training opportunity to equip me with essential techniques, knowledge, and problem-solving skills. These will
prepare me for the R00 phase of research and an independent research career focusing on circuitry mechanisms
of different behaviors."

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have gained significant attention since their discovery in 1983 as important
mediators of intercellular communications, potential disease markers, therapeutic targets, and drug
delivery vehicles. Though it is widely accepted that EVs get packaged inside the cell, pass through the
extracellular environment, and deliver the cargo to the target cells. However, even after 37 yrs it is not
determined, 1) how EVs handle the differential ionic environment (cytoplasm vs extracellular), 2) whether EVs
possess any functional ion channels, and 3) whether any of these channels play a physiological role. We
focused on answering these questions and focused on an ion with the largest gradient, i.e., potassium. Using
the in silico approach, we discovered several ion channels, and the most prominent ion channels, we
discovered in exosomes is BK. We incorporated a novel electrophysiology approach, near field
electrophysiology, as canonical patch-clamp methods are not feasible due to the size of exosomes. We
discovered that functional BK channels exist in exosomes, and decide the integrity of exosomes. Our
preliminary data also indicate that exosomal BK can protect the heart from ischemia-reperfusion injury. We
will now test the hypothesis that exosomes containing BK determine the content of exosomes, facilitate
their survival in variable ionic environments, and protect the heart from IR injury. Overall the data supports the
above hypothesis which will be tested using multiple approaches and pursuing the following specific aims to,
1. establish a presence, molecular identity, and biophysical properties of BK in exosomes, 2.
determine the physiological role of BK in exosomes., and 3. elucidate the mechanistic role of exosomal
BK channels in cardioprotection. In our proposal, we have incorporated genetic mice models, and
innovative as well as a novel technology to understand a very basic and broad biological question.
 The outcome of this program will open an opportunity to study exosomal ion channels including BK
channels, and advance the exosome field by determining how exosome survive variable
osmolarities, establishing the molecular identity of exosomal ion channels, understand how cargo content
is regulated by exosomal ion channels, and the role and mechanism of exosomal ion channels in
cardioprotection. In the future, our study will set the ground for exploring other ion channels in exosomes from
different living beings as well as organ systems."
10742907,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Toxoplasma gondii with the ability to use foodborne, zoonotic, and congenital routes of transmission is an
apicomplexan parasite that can cause severe infectious disease in the immunocompromised human population.
A few antibiotics are commercially available to treat Toxoplasma infections. However, their strong side effects
and teratogenicity limit their use in certain human populations. Inhibition of fundamental nutrient metabolism
specific to this parasite will define new drug targets and assist the development of novel drugs to manage T.
gondii infection.
 Our previous studies revealed that Toxoplasma encodes an ortholog of Plasmodium chloroquine resistance
transporter (TgCRT), and localized it in the digestive vacuole, termed the Vacuolar Compartment/Plant-Like
Vacuole (VAC/PLV, VAC hereafter). Our preliminary data found that the TgCRT-deficient parasites swelled their
VACs ~15-fold. These results led to our central hypotheses: (1) the TgCRT serves as a polyspecific transporter
to regulate the VAC physiology and function in Toxoplasma, and (2) the TgCRT cooperates with a multidrug
resistance transporter-like protein in the VAC to mediate nutrient export, thereby adjusting the microenvironment
within the VAC. Towards these hypotheses, we have revealed that the swollen VAC disrupts the parasite’s
endolysosomal system and decreases transcript and protein abundances of VAC-associated proteases. We
discovered that inhibition of proteolysis within the VAC shrinks its swollen phenotype in TgCRT-null mutant. We
have also identified that a Toxoplasma ortholog of Plasmodium multidrug resistance transporter (TgMDR) is
localized in the VAC and significantly increased at the level of transcription in the parasites when TgCRT is
absent. Last, we determined that TgCRT transports chloroquine by heterologous expression of TgCRT in yeast,
suggesting that TgCRT is indeed a functional transporter and providing an amenable system to understand the
native functions of TgCRT and other VAC-localizing transporters. Guided by our compelling preliminary studies,
we propose three specific aims to characterize the native functions of TgCRT and TgMDR, and how they
functionally interact together to regulate VAC physiology and function by serving as nutrient transporters: (1)
Quantify the physiological environment within the VAC; (2) Measure the transport of small nutrient solutes by
CRT; and (3) Determine the functional relationship between TgCRT and TgMDR in the regulation of the VAC
morphology and physiology.
 Our proposed research will broadly impact the field by characterizing the molecular mechanisms by which
Toxoplasma parasites regulate the physiology and function of their digestive vacuoles. Our studies will also help
comprehend the native functions of TgCRT and TgMDR, and such knowledge can be generalized to expand
understanding of their orthologs in other apicomplexan parasites and organisms."

The coordination of genetic programs and the physical organization of cells sculpt developing tissues, drive
regeneration and, when dysregulated, facilitate disease. How these two processes are coordinated in space and
time is poorly understood. Cell-cell interfaces are important organizing centers for morphogenic instruction. Here
signals influencing gene expression that ultimately dictate cell fate decisions are integrated with changes in cell
mechanics and, together, are necessary to build and maintain multicellular architectures. With an appreciation
that gene regulatory networks and mechanics conspire at cell-cell interfaces to instruct morphogenic processes,
an emerging challenge is to experimentally define the details of their intersectional operations in diverse
morphogenic contexts. One intriguing example of cell-cell communication is the ubiquitously important Notch
receptor pathway which has the intrinsic capacity to regulate both cell mechanics and gene expression, yet
mechanisms of these distinct activities are unclear. As a postdoctoral fellow, the PI developed biomimetic
microfluidic models of human tissues that were employed to identify several new mechanisms controlling 3D
multicellular behavior operating at cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interfaces. The PI discovered that the
highly conserved Notch family of receptors possess a previously undescribed cortical signaling function that
permits Notch to connect changes in cell mechanics to transcriptional output. As an independent laboratory, the
Kutys Lab has completed the first investigation into cortical Notch signaling in epithelial tissues and has identified
morphogenic consequences and previously unappreciated signaling mechanisms. Over the next five years, the
goal of the Kutys Lab is to continue its multidisciplinary approach of developing next generation biomimetic
human tissue systems, molecular technologies, and microscopy-based methods to define the coordination of
morphogenic behavior and signaling at cell adhesive interfaces. We will focus these efforts in three Areas: 1)
engineering new tools to deeply understand how the cortical Notch pathway regulates signaling and adhesion
mechanics in epithelia and the contexts in which it is invoked to regulate important biological processes in vitro
and in vivo, 2) comprehensively defining how Notch receptor localization and activation are influenced by
biophysical interactions with cell-cell adhesions and cortical actin during epithelial crowding and in endothelial
cells exposed to shear stress, and 3) integrating proteomic approaches with 3D biomimetic systems to broadly
profile and dissect how tissue architecture influences molecular control systems operating at cell-cell interfaces.
The results of this research and the integration of the enabling technologies will contribute to the overall
objectives of my research program. Together, these studies will offer fundamental insight into an important new
arm of Notch signaling, how cell-cell adhesions might be dynamically regulated, and the molecular basis for how
transcriptional and adhesive programs might be coordinated within complex 3D tissues."

This R01 comprises a collaboration between scientists in the US and Belgium that seeks to develop synergistic
antiviral drug combinations that keep pace with the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic and
future outbreaks of related coronaviruses. We will exploit i) the principles of synergistic activity that arise with
drug combinations and ii) novel mathematical approaches to optimize human dosing for treating emerging and
re-emerging coronaviruses with pandemic potential. We will identify combinations of drugs that i) target
conserved cellular factors that support virus infection, and/or ii) target viral enzymes that are essential for viral
replication, to develop novel antiviral drug combinations against multiple coronaviruses (i.e., a pan-family drug
cocktail). Based on our previous work, mathematical modeling approaches will be used to i) identify drug
combinations with synergistic antiviral action, ii) prioritize drug combinations and dosing strategies for testing in
rodent models of virus infection and disease, and iii) predict in vivo efficacy in humans with various dosing
strategies. Our research plan provides a proactive approach for global pandemic response and preparedness,
with deliverables consisting of i) combinations of compounds that confer potent, synergistic suppression of
multiple coronaviruses and have sufficiently high and durable plasma and tissue concentrations and ii) publicly
available harmonized clinical trial designs that will allow for efficient testing of multiple agents in parallel at the
inception of new epidemics. As the approach is applicable to any virus family, the project portends global
impact by improving protection of the general population against existing viral threats, enhancing preparedness
and response for future viral outbreaks, and offering immediately testable and deployable oral drug
combinations that fill the time void between virus identification and development and deployment of viral

10909296,"Environmental toxicants and, more specifically, exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) air pollution
increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and AD-Related Dementias (ADRD). Yet, our current
understanding of the mechanisms by which PM exposure augments the progression of ADRD-related pathology
and cognitive impairment is very limited. We posit that airborne ultrafine particles (UFP, <100 nm diameter) are
causally related to the development or progression of AD/ADRD. The glymphatic pathway is emerging as a key
to maintaining brain health and its dysfunction is implicated in several neurological disorders. This glial-
dependent clearance pathway is dedicated to draining soluble waste proteins and its existence has been
documented in the brain of multiple species, including humans. The proposal is based on preliminary studies
showing that exposure to model UFP significantly suppresses glymphatic fluid transport and increases the β
amyloid load in a murine model of AD pathology. We hypothesize that airborne UFP are transported to the
brain upon inhalation exposure and cause both systemic and neuroinflammation, thus either indirectly
or directly impairing glymphatic fluid flow and accelerating AD/ADRD-like pathology and behavioral
deficits in a mouse model of AD. The proposed aims will test our hypothesis by addressing the following
questions: Aim 1: How does short (3 days) or repeated (3 months intermittent) exposure to UFP affect glymphatic
fluid transport and cognitive performance in young (3 months) and aged (15 months) wildtype mice? Aim 2: Can
glymphatic impairment resulting from UFP exposure change the progression of Aβ deposition in a murine
AD/ADRD model? Aim 3: Will UFP accumulate and interact with cells along the major glymphatic fluid transport
segments? We will here use high-resolution analytical scanning transmission electron microscopy to analyze
precisely where in the brain parenchyma the UFP accumulate and interact. Aim 4: We will explore the molecular
mechanisms of UFP exposure-related glymphatic impairment and pathological progression in a murine
AD/ADRD model via pharmacological inhibition of adrenergic signaling. Moreover, a detailed study of AQP4
vascular polarization response to air particulate matter exposure, sleep disruption and how do adrenergic
inhibition reverse these signatures of pathology, would also be explored? The innovative aspects of the proposal
build upon a unique multidisciplinary approach where expertise in particulate matter toxicology (Elder), basic
and applied chemistry with particular focus on the study of UFP in living systems (Graham), neurobiology of
diseases and regenerative mechanisms (Hussain), and fundamentals of waste products and metabolites
clearance (Nedergaard), will be combined to address the question if and how do UFP enter, distribute,
accumulate, and ultimately undergo bioprocessing and efflux from the brain.
 The proposed experiments represent the first fundamental analysis and mechanistic underpinning of the
interconnection between PM exposure, glymphatics, inflammation, and ADRD initiation and progression."

been the mainstay in nuclear imaging (specifically for cardiac screening) are not optimized for brain imaging
where achieving simultaneously high resolution and high sensitivity is necessary. Depending on the collimator
choice, DHGC resolution is 7-15 mm FWHM, which is not very useful to visualize fine structures of the human
brain. There are several ongoing projects with the premise of improved scanner performance compared to the
DHGC systems, however they are either focusing on using old detector technology and mainly improving the
collimator geometry or focusing on very expensive (order of magnitude compared with the current designs)
semiconductor technology which also leads to a complex system.
With this application we seek to develop a portable SPECT scanner for dynamic brain imaging with ~4 mm
FWHM resolution at the same sensitivity of the DHGC or 8x more sensitivity at 7 mm resolution. The backbone
of the design is our enabling technology to fabricate high resolution detectors at practical cost. The proposed
project will open new avenues for low dose brain SPECT imaging applications and enable longitudinal studies."
10903888,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is closely associated with the impairment of many metabolic pathways,
including decreased hepatic insulin sensitivity and secretion, increased glucagon, and the risk of developing type 2
diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Conversely, patients with diabetes have a higher prevalence of steatohepatitis and end-
stage liver disease. As an intermediate state of hyperglycemia easily detectable in clinical settings, prediabetes is
the condition that precedes T2DM but the progression is variable, which could increase over time with associated
risk factors. To date, the mechanisms underlying prediabetic progression are still not understood. We think
simultaneous imaging of the abdominal organs’ abnormalities along the liver-pancreas axis and measures of insulin
action, secretion, and hepatic extraction can provide insights into T2DM development, a better understanding of the
relationship between NAFLD and diabetes, and an opportunity to intervene in prediabetic progression.
The overall goal of this work is to develop an advanced multiparametric abdominal MRE method for
characterizing pathophysiologic state of the liver-pancreas axis and prediabetic progression in NAFLD.
• In Aim 1, A multifrequency, self-navigating, and hybrid radial-Cartesian 3D vector magnetic resonance
 elastography (MRE) technology will be developed and expanded on the liver, pancreas and fat data acquisition
 and image reconstruction. Ten healthy volunteers will be recruited during MRE driver, imaging sequence and
 reconstruction development and optimization. Benchmark for technical success will be evaluated with a test-retest
 repeatability and measurement agreement study on ten patients with diagnosed NAFLD.
• In Aim 2, We will perform quantitative imaging assessments of the liver-pancreas axis in a cross-sectional study in
 150 patients with diagnosed NAFLD with varying risk or progression to diabetes (i.e., 50 patients without diabetes,
 50 patients with prediabetes, 50 patients with diabetes). Laboratory and clinical data, as well as insulin secretion
 and action measurements, will be collected within 30 days of MRI/MRE. Precursory tissue abnormalities and
 integrative metabolic-mechanical models will be trained and evaluated to assess the risk of developing T2DM.
• In Aim 3, assuming 20% withdrawal rate, we plan to have one-year follow-up examinations in 120 patients out of
 those who have baseline examinations in Aim 2. The models trained in Aim 2 will be further tuned with longitudinal
 MRI/MRE changes for assessing bi-directional treatment effects on tissue composition, structural and metabolic
 features, bridging the cellular, gland, enzymes, and hormones to the liver-pancreas axis, thereby predicting
 progression or regression direction of diabetes development in NAFLD.
We anticipate that this program will provide initial validation of multiparametric MRI/MRE and the derived
surrogate to assess the liver-pancreas axis of diabetes progression in NAFLD. This project’s success will
also provide a valuable noninvasive assessment tool for emerging therapeutic interventions."

The temporal and spatial distribution of signaling proteins is dynamically regulated by post-translational
modifications (PTMs). PTMs such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, or lipid modification dictate protein activities
and access to substrates, thereby cellular outcomes. The precise control of signaling pathways is critical to
normal hematopoiesis and aberrant signaling leads to malignant transformation of hematopoietic stem and
progenitor cells (HSPCs). This application is based on our novel finding that FLT3 (FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3)
is palmitoylated and disrupting palmitoylation of oncogenic FLT3 mutants changes their subcellular localization,
rewires downstream signaling, and promotes leukemic progression. Internal tandem duplication within FLT3
(FLT3-ITD) is one of the most frequent mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and correlates with poor
prognosis. While wildtype FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase is activated at the plasma membrane to transduce
PI3K/AKT and RAS/MAPK signaling, FLT3-ITD resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and triggers
constitutive STAT5 phosphorylation. Mechanisms underlying this aberrant FLT3-ITD subcellular localization or
its impact on leukemogenesis remain poorly understood. We discovered that FLT3-ITD is S-palmitoylated by the
ZDHHC6 acyltransferase. Disruption of palmitoylation redirects FLT3-ITD to the plasma membrane and rewires
its downstream signaling by activating AKT and ERK pathways in addition to STAT5. Consequently, abrogation
of FLT3-ITD palmitoylation via ZDHHC6 depletion promotes FLT3-ITD surface expression, signaling, and
increased leukemic progression in xenotransplanted mouse models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that FLT3
proteins are palmitoylated in primary human AML cells. Stabilization of FLT3-ITD palmitoylation by
pharmacological inhibition of depalmitoylation synergizes with FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) gilteritinib in
abrogating the growth of primary FLT3-ITD+ AML cells. The central goal of this grant is to define the molecular
basis underlying the regulation of oncogenic FLT3 signaling by palmitoylation and explore its physiological and
functional significance in myeloid malignancies. We propose to define roles of ZDHHC6 in FLT3-ITD
palmitoylation in vivo in mouse models of myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) and AML. We will also identify
depalmitoylase(s) for FLT3-ITD that modify FLT3-ITD localization, and activity using combinatorial approaches
of targeted and unbiased chemical biology, molecular biology, and genetics. Moreover, we will explore the
therapeutic potential of targeting FLT3-ITD depalmitoylation in primary human FLT3-ITD+ AMLs. We will
investigate if inhibition of FLT3-ITD depalmitoylase enhances responses to TKI using primary human AML cells
as well as patient-derived xenotransplant (PDX) models. These findings provide novel insights into lipid-
dependent compartmentalization of FLT3-ITD signaling and suggest targeting depalmitoylation as a new
therapeutic strategy to treat FLT3-ITD+ leukemias."

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease of the joints, that affects over 16% of people over 60 in the US.
Age and injury are the primary risk factors for OA. There is a critical need to develop therapies for OA
treatment, as current treatment options rely primarily on pain management and joint replacement, while OA is
only becoming increasingly prevalent in our aging population. Chronic exposure to cellular stressors profoundly
disrupts the homeostasis of articular chondrocytes (ACs), the primary cell type covering the surface of the joint,
leading to AC senescence, apoptosis, and degeneration of the smooth surface of the joint. We know that
nuclear changes to chromatin structure impacts the biological age of many tissues and contributes to the
manifestation of aging phenotypes and wanted to investigate whether this is also true in OA. Our preliminary
data suggests that chromatin structure is disrupted in ACs in OA and may be a contributing factor to OA
disease progression.
The overall objective of this proposal is to dissect the mechanism(s) of how aging and stressors influence
chromatin structure to disrupt AC homeostasis to ultimately give rise to OA. Our preliminary findings suggest
that abnormal activation of transposable elements (TEs) occurs preferentially in OA tissue. We hypothesize
that cellular stresses accumulate with age to impair TE silencing in ACs, thereby triggering inflammation and
eventually, OA. We will test our hypothesis: by determining if chromatin accessibility and TE activation
increase with age and presence of osteoarthritis in ACs; by determining if TE activation in OA models can
augment OA progression; and by evaluating if stress causes TE activation and osteoarthritis.
Impact: This project will yield a mechanistic understanding of the connection between aging, stress conditions,
ERV activation, and OA pathogenesis. Importantly, this proposal has the potential to impact joint health and
mobility of our aging population."
10925368,"The field of computational psychiatry seeks to understand the symptoms and causes of neuropsychiatric
diseases as dysfunctional learning processes. The learning algorithms used by the brain fall along a continuum
between two extremes. At one end of the continuum is model-free learning, an automatic process that relies on
trial-and-error, storing the values of past actions, and inflexibly repeating those actions that led to higher
values. On the other end is model-based learning, which generates predictions via a computationally
expensive, deliberative process that models the environment, which endows flexibility to respond to
environmental changes. Dysfunction of these algorithms can produce maladaptive behaviors. For example,
compulsive behavior is argued to arise from disruption of model-based learning, which biases patients towards
more inflexible model-free learning mechanisms. Although a great deal of progress has been made in
understanding the neural mechanisms underlying model-free learning, we have limited understanding of how
the brain uses models to generate reward predictions.
The grant aims to test the hypothesis that interactions between hippocampus (HPC) and orbitofrontal cortex
(OFC) implement model-based learning. Specifically, we predict that HPC is responsible for constructing a
cognitive map that instantiates a neural representation of behavioral tasks, and OFC is responsible for using
the cognitive map to generate reward predictions that can be used to generate flexible decision-making. The
current grant will test key predictions of this hypothesis. Our first aim uses a novel task that temporally
separates the presentation of information about states and values. We will use high-channel count recordings
from HPC and OFC and closed-loop microstimulation to examine how the putative HPC state representation
affects the coding of value in OFC. In addition, we will examine whether this interaction occurs through the
synchronization of the theta rhythm between the two areas. In the second aim, we will examine how a more
complex map involving multiple distinct states might be used to enable rapid readjustments to reward changes.
Dysfunction of pathways between HPC and frontal cortex are implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders,
including schizophrenia, major depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Medication-based treatments
have failed to show significant reduction in the prevalence or severity of these disorders. An alternative
approach is to use electrical stimulation, but to date this has also yielded mixed results. Our goal is to develop
more sophisticated devices that will interact with neural circuits in a more principled way to treat
neuropsychiatric disorders, such as using neural activity to detect symptoms and microstimulation to intervene.
An impediment to this approach is that the neural coding in many of these circuits remains poorly understood.
The aim of the current grant is to understand the neuronal properties of HPC and OFC to help lay the
groundwork for future potential therapeutic approaches based on closed-loop microstimulation."

We are proposing a new approach to a hybrid imaging modality that has been called “b+g” or “pamma-positron”
Imaging [Gri07] that promises to simultaneously overcome 1) the sensitivity limits of single-gamma-ray-photon
emission imaging, 2) the challenge of distinguishing between two different positron-emitting isotopes, and 3) the
physics-based spatial resolution limits inherent in radioisotope imaging based on detection of positron-
annihilation photons alone [Lan14]. The intent is to significantly advance molecular imaging of the human brain
by allowing visualization of smaller substructures, quantification of smaller amounts of radiotracer uptake, and
simultaneous measurement of multiple dynamic and spatial uptake patterns in advanced multi-isotope studies
of normal brain function. The required elements to make this feasible comprise i) a detector approach for
annihilation and gamma-ray photons that can yield rich data for precise energy, position, and timing estimation
for both photoelectric and Compton interactions, ii) processing algorithms in firmware and software to sort and
make optimal use of the various combinations of signals that can occur with and without coincidence, iii)
reconstruction algorithms based on likelihoods that incorporate probabilities of emission, detection, positron
range, non-collinearity, and Compton kinematics, and iv) detection and compensation for attenuation and subject
motion – effects that if not addressed will become limiting factors for resolution and image quality.
 In contrast to early efforts to accomplish b+g imaging with liquid xenon detectors [Gri07], scattering
detectors as inserts into PET scanners [Yos20], or planar semiconductor detectors paired with scintillation
cameras [Lan14], we propose instead to develop and demonstrate a single detector technology and associated
data processing methods that can be used for both 511 keV annihilation photons and the higher-energy, singly-
emitted gamma rays. Abbaszadeh (MPI) and Levin have pioneered an edge-on crossed-strip cadmium zinc
telluride (CZT) detector approach to PET detectors that provides an ideal starting point [Abb16]. Among their
attributes are high stopping power based on the edge-on geometry, 3D positioning that minimizes parallax,
excellent energy resolution, and dynamic range up to 1.2 MeV in maximum photon energy deposited per
interaction. Furthermore, when a photon undergoes an initial scatter followed by a photoelectric absorption, these
modules yield data vectors that allow position and energy estimation for both interactions that can be analyzed
with Compton kinematics [Abb17].
 We will carry out a 2-year simulation and proof-of-principle phase (UG3) in which we demonstrate b+g
detection with edge-on CZT modules and measure detector characteristics, develop simulations that support
reconstructions, and demonstrate acquisitions with single and multiple isotopes. We will carry out a three-year
UH3 phase to build a tomographic system with a field of view sufficient to investigate imaging of sophisticated
dynamic phantoms and in vivo imaging of rodent brain, as a design study and precursor to a human brain system."

Trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC) is a leading driver of morbidity and mortality following severe injury.
Affecting as many as 30% of critically ill trauma patients, TIC represents a spectrum of coagulation phenotypes
ranging from early impaired hemostasis to later micro and macrovascular thrombotic complications. We have
identified that patients with TIC have evidence of severe endothelial damage, and these markers of endothelial
injury correlate closely with outcomes in trauma. Further, through randomized controlled trials testing pre-
hospital plasma as a resuscitation tool, we have identified that plasma transfusion can reduce endothelial
injury, even in the patients with the highest injury severity. Plasma transfusion reduces mortality after severe
trauma, but the exact mechanism of benefit is unknown. In the present proposal, we address the central
hypothesis that the endothelium is a central regulator of TIC. We propose to characterize the role of the
endothelium as the regulator of maladaptive response and a crucial interface for thrombosis-inflammation
crosstalk. Our strategy will focus on identifying key circulating mediators after trauma that induce endothelial
injury. We will utilize a “cue, signal, response” framework to robustly characterize the molecular pathways
activated in the endothelial and how the endothelial response interfaces with changes in the coagulation
response. Finally, we will define the “reparative phenotype” that plasma transfusion creates, restoring the
endothelium to homeostasis. We will use this to test targeted therapies to address the unmet needs in trauma
resuscitation targeting endothelial health. The approach will leverage state-of-the-science and novel
techniques in proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, advanced microvascular imaging, and pre-clinical
models of trauma and hemorrhage in addition to a large repository of previously collected trauma patient
samples."

Childhood obesity is a major public health threat with rates increasing at an alarming rate
worldwide. Currently 22.4% of children and adolescents are obese, approximately 16.7 million,
with rates of obesity increasing in all age groups in the pediatric population. Obese children are
more likely to be diagnosed with several major morbidities (hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
coronary artery disease, and diabetes). The estimated annual health care costs of obesity-
related illness are a staggering $190.2 billion or nearly 21% of annual medical spending in the
United States. Household air pollution (HAP) is a term that describes the health and
environmental impacts of pollutants produced from incomplete combustion of solid fuels such as
wood, coal, charcoal, animal dung, crop wastes burnt on open fires or wood-burning stoves in
poorly ventilated homes and releases suspended particulate matter (PM). There are few studies
examining the role of household air pollution including PM2.5 in cardiovascular risk in the setting
of pediatric obesity. An important component of cardiovascular health is a diurnal variation of
blood pressure, where nocturnal levels are approximately 20% lower than daytime values. The
absence of nocturnal BP-dipping in childhood may be an important indicator of early disease
risks and our team has recently published evidence that childhood obesity is associated with
non-dipping. The specific project proposed here will test the hypothesis that exposure to
household air pollution increases cardiovascular risk in obese children through an inflammation-
related disruption in diurnal BP regulation. This project will recruit patients aged 10-18 to define
relationships between at-home air quality and hypertension risk factors. A pilot study to
determine the impact of high efficacy particulate matter (HEPA) filtration units on air quality
exposure and health risks will be measured in these patients as well. This research addresses a
significant public health issue by understanding and identifying environmental exposures in a
vulnerable high-risk group of rural children in order to develop new treatments to improve their
health."

The overarching goal of this K99/R00 proposal is to explore aggregate genetic liability and neurocognitive
mechanisms in the co-occurrence of alcohol use/problems and suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB). Excessive
alcohol use is prevalent worldwide and represents a significant burden to human health; it is associated with
medical and psychopathological problems such as STB. STB are a critical public health concern, with a
continuing increase in suicide attempts and deaths every year in the US. The prevalence of STB is particularly
high among individuals with alcohol problems and studies have tackled this question from different perspectives.
Research indicates that alcohol problems could causally impact risk of STB; there is also empirical support for a
shared genetic liability between alcohol use/problems and STB. This shared genetic liability underscores the
existence of possible common mechanisms that would be involved in both alcohol use/problems and STB.
Decision-making (DM) has been observed in relation with adolescent drinking behavior and alcohol use disorder,
while both have been associated with STB. In STB research, DM difficulties have been described and may be
characteristic of impulsive suicide attempts, but current findings largely rely on self-reports and lack objective
evaluations. Additional knowledge could be gained by relying on a theoretical conceptualization of DM, a
systematic evaluation of its underlying neurocognitive mechanisms, and a consideration of the role of genetic
factors. Capitalizing on genetics and neuropsychology, we will explore which DM mechanisms play a role in
alcohol use/problems and STB co-occurrence, how genetic liability is involved in this association, and whether
environmental factors may influence the development of DM and its relation with alcohol use/problems and STB.
An improved understanding of these processes will contribute to prevention and intervention efforts by advancing
our ability to target potentially modifiable mechanisms according to the influence of genes and environment.
 This proposal delineates a series of training aims to advance our understanding of the co-occurrence
between alcohol use/problems and STB: 1) the candidate will establish expertise in the assessment of aggregate
genetic risks and other genetic models, and in advanced statistical methods that will lay the foundation of her
independent career; 2) different suicide phenotypes will be used and distinguished according to their association
with alcohol use, neurocognitive, and genetic characteristics; 3) the K99/R00 proposal gathers experts in the
disciplines of genetics and neuropsychology that will support the development of the scientific project and the
pathway to independence. The environment at the Virginia Institute for Psychiatric and Behavioral Genetics is
ideal for the candidate’s goal of developing a comprehensive program in genetics, alcohol, and STB research,
and the proposed project represents an important contribution toward advancing the understanding of alcohol
use/problems and STB through a combination of genetics and neuropsychological methods, consistent with
NIAAA’s missions."
10919845,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Opioid use disorder (OUD) is often comorbid with other drug use, and alcohol is one of the most commonly co-
used drugs. Yet most of the basic research on OUD has been conducted in single-drug use models. Current
FDA-approved treatments for OUD target the endogenous opioid system directly, either as substitution therapies
(e.g. buprenorphine, methadone) or antagonists that oppose opioid effects (e.g. naltrexone, naloxone). These
treatments establish the mu opioid receptor (MOR) as a major therapeutic target for OUD. Similarly, opioids have
been implicated in the pathophysiology of alcohol use disorder (AUD), and naltrexone is used to treat both OUD
and AUD, further underscoring the overlapping mechanisms between these disorders. As the seat of executive
function, the prefrontal cortex plays an integral role in the inhibitory control over drug craving and relapse.
Humans with substance use disorders (SUDs) exhibit structural and functional changes in the prefrontal cortex,
accompanied by deficits in cognitive function. Thus, the prefrontal cortex may be a key locus for opioid-induced
adaptations that impact SUD severity. My lab has identified the rodent infralimbic (IL) prefrontal cortex projection
to the nucleus accumbens shell (ILNAshell) as an important limiter of heroin seeking. Within the IL cortex,
interneurons express MORs, and layer 5 pyramidal neurons (which give rise to the NAshell projection) express
5-HT2A receptors. Furthermore, we have recently demonstrated the ability of a 5-HT2A agonist to reduce opioid
and alcohol seeking (in single-drug use models), and these effects were long-lasting after a single treatment.
Thus, 5-HT2A agonists are an emerging class of therapeutics for OUD and AUD, and they may act upon
prefrontal cortex microcircuits to elicit these effects. This proposal aims to examine these two receptor systems,
with a focus on the prefrontal cortex, in a preclinical model of polydrug heroin and alcohol use. This model
incorporates chronic comorbid alcohol exposure, initiated prior to heroin self-administration and continuing
throughout the period of opioid exposure. The overarching objectives of this project are to identify the role of 5-
HT2A receptors in drug seeking after comorbid heroin and alcohol self-administration, to define the role of the
ILNAshell circuit in drug seeking after polydrug use, and to determine how polydrug exposure alters intrinsic
excitability of different neuronal populations in the infralimbic cortex and the regulation of neuronal excitability by
5-HT2A and MOR. These receptors are positioned to regulate excitability of cortical sub-circuits, with each
predicted to culminate in increased ILNAshell output, and therefore increased inhibitory control over drug
seeking. Information gained from this project will provide insight into whether heroin and alcohol polydrug use
elicits neuroadaptations in cortical sub-circuits that are oppositional, additive, or otherwise distinct. It will also
shed light onto how these circuits are regulated by 5-HT2A and MOR, both of which are druggable targets with
known or emerging therapeutic applications for SUDs. Collectively, this will provide the groundwork for
understanding how treatments can best be tailored to individuals with comorbid opioid and alcohol use."

The stability of the mammalian genome depends on a remarkable toolkit of surveillance, repair,
signaling, and checkpoint mechanisms. Mutations in the DNA itself, or corruptions in many of
these genome integrity mechanisms, can result in disease including cancer. Given the
importance of mutation and cell division in tumorigenesis, two central pathways in genome
integrity are the DNA damage response, and the cell division cycle. A more complete
understanding of these pathways is crucial to our knowledge of normal cellular development in
homeostasis, stem cell biology, the etiology of cancers, as well as for technical applications like
gene targeting. This project seeks to tackle outstanding problems in these fields in order to
elucidate fundamental molecular cell biology mechanisms that can improve therapeutic
outcomes in cancer.
 The F99 phase is focused on double-strand break (DSB) repair and the control of end
resection, a critical molecular ‘choice’ of whether to repair a DSB by blunt end-joining or by
homologous recombination. I revealed novel mechanistic insights about the protein controlling
this choice, 53BP1, findings relevant to the treatment of BRCA1-deficient cancers with PARP1
inhibitors. We found that—instead of blocking end resection as was generally thought—53BP1
recruits polymerase alpha to counteract resection by fill-in synthesis of the resected DSB. In the
remainder of the dissertation work, I will explore how BRCA1 and 53BP1 regulate resection and
fill-in synthesis in light of this new model. I will also gain the necessary experience and exposure
scientifically and professionally to transition to a cancer-focused postdoc in a stellar lab.
 For the K00 phase, I will shift my focus and approaches to study mechanisms preserving
genome integrity in the critical window of mitosis, where diverse chromatin biology pathways
converge. I plan to learn and implement high throughput screens, computational analysis of
larger, statistically-powerful data sets, as well as in vivo modeling in the mouse, and analysis of
sequencing data from human tumor samples. These new approaches, coupled with my already
strong background in genetics, microscopy, and biochemistry, will allow me to address the most
pressing and challenging issues in genome integrity and cancer biology today. With the aid of
this award, I intend to continue my research contribution and gain experience in order to
become a leader of my own cancer-focused lab and a leader in the field of genome integrity."
10741798,"Nearly 1 million people in the United States alone are affected by Multiple Sclerosis (MS). MS is an
inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). While MS is classically regarded as
a disease of the white matter, the number of white matter lesions does not correlate with physical disability or
cognitive impairment. Recent evidence indicates that gray matter areas have significant myelin loss and
increased cortical lesion load is associated with increased cortical atrophy and cognitive decline. Functional
imaging of patients with MS reveals increased hyperexcitability within primary motor cortex and throughout the
motor network. Moreover, functional recovery in MS patients is associated with normalization of aberrant
cortical activity, suggesting a relationship between motor network hyperexcitability and impaired motor
behavior. However, our understanding of how myelin loss influences the activity of single neurons, or neural
circuits, within grey matter is extremely limited. Outstanding questions such as, what are the consequences of
demyelination on neural physiology in the intact CNS, how demyelinating injuries affect the acquisition of new
skills, and can therapies that can enhance remyelination can restore neural and behavioral function remain
unknown. Recently, we have developed new approaches to visualize myelin, oligodendrocytes, and their
precursors in the intact mouse brain, as well as longitudinal approaches to record and monitor neural activity in
behaving animals. We have also identified novel behavioral interventions that enhance myelin repair. In this
application, we propose to capitalize on the dynamics revealed by these techniques to discern the effects of
myelin loss and repair on local circuit activity and motor behavior. The objectives of this proposal are: 1)
evaluate how myelin loss affects neuronal circuit function and 2) to elucidate the effectiveness of remyelination
therapies on restoring neural function and behavior. This proposal will demonstrate the effects of demyelination
on cortical neuronal and circuit function in vivo. These studies will validate an in vivo mouse model platform to
test efficacy of new therapeutic candidates for MS, and provide clinically relevant data regarding the efficacy of
therapies that stimulate endogenous remyelination in MS on restoring neural and behavioral function."

Children rarely become critically ill. I hypothesize that genetic risk contributes to unexpected pediatric critical
illness. Identifying risk groups allows for clinical stratification and targeted therapies, but these benefits can
only be realized if risk is known. This proposal will uncover the monogenic (i.e., single gene), polygenic (i.e.,
many genes), and pharmacogenomic (i.e., genetic effect on drug response) risks contributing to pediatric
critical illness. In Aim 1, I apply innovative gene-network discovery methods to uncover monogenic risk for viral
respiratory failure, the most common cause of pediatric intensive care unit admission. In Aim 2, I will assess
the contribution of polygenic risk to common pediatric intensive care unit morbidities (viral respiratory failure,
venous thromboembolism, acute kidney injury). In Aim 3, I will assess pharmacogenomic risk detected by
exome and genome sequencing. This K08 will uncover genetic risk in critically ill children which will inform
future multi-center genetic association studies and clinical trials to improve care in the pediatric intensive care
unit. Candidate: Scientifically, I have a PhD in neuroscience and completed a post-doctoral fellowship in
human genetics. Clinically, I am an attending physician in pediatric critical care medicine. There is a need for
physician-scientists who can identify unusual disease presentations and uncover novel genetic risk. There is
limited application of precision medicine in the pediatric intensive care unit, and I am well positioned to identify
opportunities and investigate applications. My goal is to develop an independent research program focused on
“the genomics of pediatric critical illness”. During the K08 training period, I will: (1) Refine expertise in gene
network discovery, (2) Develop expertise in the novel application of polygenic risk scores to children with
critical illness, (3) Develop expertise in pharmacogenomic analysis of exomes and genomes, (4) Become

team of experts in genetics and medicine (Dr Gharavi, Mentor and Dr. Chung, Advisor), polygenic risk scores
(Dr. Kiryluk, Advisor), pharmacogenomics (Dr. Jobanputra, Advisor and Dr. Chung, Advisor), statistical
genetics (Dr. Ionita-Laza, Advisor), allergy and inborn errors of immunity (Dr. Orange, Advisor), renal genetics

research will be conducted at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, which will give me access to
extensive resources and training to help me successfully transition to independence."
10888379,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) in the U.S. is a significant public health concern. NIAAA recently proposed an
operational definition of recovery from AUD to advance research in this area, including: 1) remission from
DSM-5 AUD, 2) cessation from heavy drinking, and 3) improvements in biopsychosocial functioning and quality
of life. Knowledge gained from studying recovery as operationally defined by NIAAA using novel
methodological and theoretical approaches has great potential to inform clinical practice and improve patient
care for those suffering from AUD. Most people who recover from AUD never receive treatment, and yet very
little is known about the process of “natural” recovery in the absence of intervention. Voluntary temporary
abstinence campaigns, such as “Dry January” and “Sober October,” are month-long periods of abstinence from
alcohol that are increasing in popularity. As self-initiated change attempts for a defined period, these
campaigns provide a unique means for studying natural AUD recovery. Longitudinal observational studies of
voluntary temporary abstinence campaigns can be used to test theoretically informed predictors of recovery
during and after participation in the campaign. The proposed study will test two disparate theories, self-
determination theory and behavioral economic theory, both of which are novel theories of mechanisms
underlying AUD recovery. Self-determination theory explains behavior change based on internalization of
motivation, whereas behavioral economic theory explains behavior change based on benefits and costs of
competing behaviors. Testing both theories will provide critically important information about how individuals
may initiate (or not) and maintain (or not) self-directed changes in behavior during and following intended
participation in a voluntary temporary abstinence campaign. Our objective in this proposal is to leverage two
voluntary temporary abstinence campaigns to comprehensively investigate the tenets of self-determination
theory and behavioral economic theory to better understand AUD recovery. We will recruit sex-balanced and
racially/ethnically diverse online samples who meet criteria for past-year AUD, engaged in past-month
hazardous drinking, and intend to participate in either Dry January (n = 125) or Sober October (n =125).
Participants will complete a baseline assessment prior to participation in voluntary temporary abstinence and
follow-up assessments 3, 6, and 12 months after. This innovative design will allow us to examine natural AUD

10889263,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Infections by intracellular bacterial pathogens are a leading cause of illness and mortality worldwide. Listeria
monocytogenes (Lm) is a gram-positive food-borne pathogen that replicates within the cytosol of host cells and
causes listeriosis, a life-threatening disease that affects newborns, immunocompromised individuals, pregnant
people, and the elderly. A key aspect of Lm pathogenesis is the ability of bacteria to use actin-based motility to
spread into neighboring cells via Lm-induced protrusions. The formation and uptake of Lm protrusions is a multi-
stage process that includes protrusion initiation, elongation, stabilization, and engulfment by neighboring cells.
The host and bacterial factors required for each step of protrusion dynamics have remained unclear. We have
discovered that a host protein, Abi1, localizes to Lm-induced protrusions and is required for efficient Lm cell-to-
cell spread in human epithelial cells. Moreover, prior host factor screens have indicated that Abi1 is critical for
infection by additional intracellular bacterial pathogens. The focus of this proposal is to determine the
requirement of Abi1 and potential host accessory proteins for Lm protrusion dynamics and cell-to-cell spread. In
Aim I, the requirement of Abi1 for cell-to-cell spread will be determined by infecting host cells of different lineages
in which Abi1 expression has been knocked down or knocked out with Lm strains expressing GFP. Assessment
of foci of infections by fluorescence microscopy and plaquing assays will be used to evaluate cell-to-cell spread.
Furthermore, immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy will be used to determine the localization of Abi1 during
infection and to characterize protrusions within wild-type and Abi1-negative host cells. Transmission electron
microscopy will be used to determine differences in the architecture of Lm-induced protrusions in Abi1-negative
cells. In addition, spinning disk confocal live-cell imaging with GFP-Abi1 expressing host cells and Lm expressing
TagRFP will be used to determine the spatiotemporal localization of Abi1 during Lm infection. In Aim II, we will
use host cells expressing full-length and truncated GFP-Abi1 variants with IF microscopy to identify the domain(s)
of Abi1 responsible for Abi1 localization to Lm protrusions. Plaquing assays will be performed to determine if
Abi1 truncation variants can complement cell-to-cell spread in ABI1 knockout cells. We will determine the
requirement of known Abi1 interacting proteins for localization of Abi1 and Lm protrusion formation using RNAi
in conjunction with IF and spinning disk confocal microscopy. Plaquing assays in cells depleted for known Abi1
interacting proteins or the Abi1 interacting proteins and Abi1 will be performed to determine the contribution of
the accessory proteins in Lm cell-to-cell spread. To identify additional accessory proteins that may play a role in
Lm protrusion dynamics and bacterial dissemination, we will determine the complete proteomic profile of isolated
Lm-induced protrusions by mass spectrometry. The proposed studies will provide significant insights into the
role of Abi1 in regulating Lm protrusion dynamics and cell-to-cell spread and provide fundamental knowledge
into a process shared by multiple intracellular bacterial pathogens for dissemination within the host."

Research Overview – Research is focused on organic synthesis, with particular interest in developing
synthesis strategies and modes of reactivity within organic chemistry that facilitate the construction of
complex molecules with potentially valuable medicinal and/or biological properties. We have developed
over thirty stereoselective C–C bond-forming reactions based on areas of reactivity that include
metallacycle-mediated cross-coupling, [3+2] cycloaddition, vinylcyclopropane rearrangement, and radical
cascade chemistry. While some of these have been developed within a program aimed at achieving a
foundation of reactivity suitable to realize a wide range of unique “convergent” C–C bond forming
processes, others have emerged within programs in the broad area of natural product synthesis. These
combined activities, that aim to advance the fundamental backbone of organic chemistry through innovation
within the field of stereoselective synthesis, are routinely embraced as enabling technology to fuel
exploration in medicinally relevant science. For example, we have discovered: (1) a non-opioid analgesic
from efforts targeting the alkaloid conolidine, (2) unique paralog selective Hsp90 inhibitors stemming from
explorations into the synthesis of benzoquinone ansamycins, (3) selectively cytotoxic agents targeting
multiple myeloma from activities associated with the synthesis of lehualide B, (4) the first non-peptidic
selective ligand to the DBD of p53 with a natural product-inspired oligomerization, and (5) the most potent
and selective agonist of the estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) from recent investigations targeting terpenoids.
Overall Vision of the Program – This seamless integration of reaction development, natural product
synthesis, and efforts to employ our technology as an enabling tool for the discovery of novel compositions
of matter with unique biological properties defines the basic fabric of science that has been, and will
continue to be, the focus of science in the Micalizio laboratory for decades to come.
Goals for the Next Five Years – Efforts will focus on natural product total synthesis, new reaction
development, and establishing a conceptually unified asymmetric entry to tetracyclic and pentacyclic
terpenoids. These activities include target-oriented synthesis campaigns around ryanodol, corialactone D,
azadiradione (limonoid), samandarin (steroidal alkaloid), oleandrin (cardenolide), euphol (euphane), and
lupeol (pentacyclic triterpenoid). These activites have, at their core, the ambition to establish and
demonstrate novel synthesis designs and reaction methods in the context of a wide range of complex
natural products. An emerging interest is to establish a general “common” asymmetric and step economical
synthetic strategy capable of forging diverse classes of terpenoid skeletons. Contributions in this area will
clearly guide our natural product pursuits, but also play a central role in efforts to design/discover natural
product-inspired agents targeting a range of medicinally relevant biology."
10748299,"PROJECT SUMMARY (OVERALL)
The NIEHS/EPA Children's Environmental Health (CEH) and Disease Prevention Centers have rapidly
unraveled the contribution of chemical hazards to disease and disability. Substantial progress has been made
to develop interventions that reduce exposure, yet uptake and adoption of interventions remains limited at the
community and systems levels, in public health practice, and nationally. Most interventions have not been
adapted for diverse populations or settings, nor are they typically designed to scale, especially for low-income,
minority and low health literacy populations with disproportionate exposure. And few studies have rigorously
quantified the impacts of manufacturing changes, policy interventions, or dietary and other behavioral
interventions designed to reduce exposure. To achieve higher population-wide impact, CEH researchers
require expertise on dissemination research, implementation science methods and public health practice
frameworks to cross the translational bridge and achieve success in scaling evidence-based interventions
across communities for maximum impact. The objective of our proposed NYU Collaborative Center in
Children's Environmental Health Research and Translation (CEHRT) is to serve as a Resource for the CEH
community by: (1) developing meaningful prevention and intervention strategies that have promise to scale, (2)
adapting these strategies for diverse populations or settings, to achieve higher population-wide impact, and (3)
rigorously quantifying the impacts of manufacturing changes, policy interventions, or dietary and other
behavioral interventions designed to reduce exposure. NYU CEHRT unites the expertise of four existing
translational Centers to meet these urgent challenges and protect children from environmental hazards. The
cross-cutting themes of NYU CEHRT include: intervention testing, implementation science, health equity and
economic evaluation. NYU CEHRT is also home to two Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes
(ECHO) cohort centers (UH3OD023305 and UH3OD023332), and therefore extremely well-poised to integrate
new knowledge about emerging exposures likely to emerge from ECHO and the broader CEH community. It
leverages the expertise of a world-class analytical chemist, Kurunthachalam Kannan, whose NIEHS Human
Health Exposure Analysis Resource laboratory (U2CES026452) can support and stimulate innovative pilot
projects to rigorously examine changes in biomarkers of exposure resulting from modifications in diet, behavior
and household factors. NYU CEHRT will create a robust, mentored training environment that stimulates and
supports innovation by early stage investigators in promising time-sensitive, applied or interventional CEH
research. It will advance translational CEH research through innovative pilot projects to test and adapt
promising or evidence-based interventions in diverse settings, and utilize implementation science and
dissemination research frameworks to improve uptake and adoption of CEH research findings."

Hypertension is a risk factor for stroke, heart attack, kidney disease and death. Hypertension prevalence is high
in sub-Saharan Africa, specifically in persons living with HIV. Apart from traditional risk factors such as high body
mass index, age, immune activation and lifestyle, dietary salt is one of the driving factors contributing to the
development of hypertension directly by promoting pathological changes in the vasculature and indirectly through
immune activation and inflammation. Salt intake is driven mainly by salt taste sensitivity and specific genetic
variations in the taste receptor genes. High salt consumption is an independent predictor of hypertension, arterial
stiffness and cardiovascular disease. Salt consumption is generally high in Low- and Middle-Income Countries
including Zambia. The effects of salt on blood pressure (BP) are more pronounced in individuals with salt
sensitivity of blood pressure (SSBP). SSBP is when changes in BP mirror changes in dietary salt
intake/depletion. It is not clear if salt taste sensitivity correlates with SSBP. Furthermore, genetic variations in
the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in the tongue associated with salt taste sensitivity are unknown. Therefore,
the aims of this project are to: 1. To determine if salt taste sensitivity is associated with salt intake, SSBP and
inflammation in persons with HIV. We hypothesize that salt taste sensitivity correlates with SSBP and
inflammation. To achieve this, an existing cohort with known SSBP will be utilized and inflammatory biomarkers
measured using ELISA and flow cytometry, 24-hr food recall and 24-hour urine will be measured to assess
dietary salt intake. Salt taste sensitivity will be analysed using serial diluted salt solutions, and compared with
salt intake, SSBP and inflammation between people with and without HIV. Aim 2. To determine if genetic
variations in ENaC are associated with salt taste perception, SSBP and hypertension in HIV. We hypothesize
that specific genetic variations in the taste receptor genes particularly for ENaC are associated with salt taste,
SSBP and hypertension. To achieve this, genetic sequencing of taste receptor genes will be performed to
determine linkage with salt taste sensitivity and SSBP in persons with and without HIV. These studies will
generate hypotheses for future interventional studies. In addition, the long-term goal is to generate a biobank of
saliva and blood samples of persons from Africa for future genomic, proteomic and metabolomic analysis in an
R01 grant application."
10899581,"Over the past decade, roles for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in the biogenesis of select nuclear-encoded
mitochondrial precursors and the degradation of mutant, mis-localized, or non-productively imported proteins
from the mitochondrial outer membrane (OM) have begun to emerge. Our interest in this unanticipated, novel
ER-associated mitochondrial biology was serendipitous. In our ongoing efforts to characterize the lipid
substrate trafficking requirements for phosphatidylserine (PS) decarboxylase 1 (Psd1 in yeast, PISD in
humans), an evolutionarily conserved, integral inner mitochondrial membrane protein that produces
phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), it became a priority for us to independently ascertain if a small fraction of wild
type (WT) Psd1 is glycosylated and thus targeted to the endomembrane system, as recently claimed. Our
generated results support the unavoidable conclusion that in yeast, the vast majority, if not all, of functional
Psd1 is mitochondrially localized. However, we did uncover an intimate relationship between Psd1 and the ER:
unlike the WT protein, non-functional forms of Psd1 are dually localized to the ER, where they are
glycosylated, ubiquitinated, and rapidly degraded. Given the role of the ER as a staging ground for the efficient
removal of non-functional Psd1, we then asked two questions ― 1) Is Psd1 biogenesis supported by a recently
discovered Djp1-mediated Endoplasmic Reticulum Surface Retrieval pathway (ER-SURF)? and 2) Does the
accumulation of ER-associated non-functional Psd1 depend on Msp1, an outer mitochondrial membrane
resident AAA-ATPase known to remove mis-targeted proteins and non-productively imported mitochondrial
precursors from the outer membrane? The resulting answers establish the premise for our proposed aims and
identify Psd1 as an ideal model substrate to define novel mechanisms of ER-SURF and protein degradation
that will undoubtedly apply to other mitochondrial proteins. The goal of Aim 1 is to define the early, pre-
mitochondrial steps of Psd1 biogenesis that are mediated by specific interactions that occur at the ER. Other
than a critical role for the Hsp40 cochaperone, Djp1, virtually nothing is known about ER-SURF. Results from
Aim 1 will provide mechanistic insight about mitochondrial targeting through this novel pathway and whether it
can be coerced in specific contexts to support non-mitochondrial biology. Over the past seven years, it has
become increasingly appreciated that the accumulation of mitochondrial precursors outside of this organelle
activates a range of cellular stress responses. In this context, our discovery that non-functional mutant Psd1
temporarily associates with ER membranes prior to being degraded is particularly exciting. The goal of Aim 2 is
to determine the molecular mechanisms of non-functional Psd1 resolution. Results from Aim 2 will transform
our understanding of how cells cope with mitochondrial precursors that fail to reach their correct destination, an
emerging focus in the field."

10745982,"Project Summary
Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality; every year, nearly three million people
develop TB disease but are never notified to public health authorities. Studies in Vietnam and Zimbabwe have
shown that intensive efforts to find individuals with undiagnosed TB (“active case finding”, ACF) can greatly
reduce TB burden. However, in high-burden countries, repeated population-level ACF is not a viable strategy.
Therefore, it is critical to understand whether ACF can be implemented in a manner that is both economically/
logistically feasible and epidemiologically impactful. Additionally, as an estimated 23% of the world's population
is infected with M. tuberculosis, it is increasingly clear that global targets to end TB cannot be achieved without
scaling up TB preventive therapy (TPT). Since ruling out TB disease is essential before providing TPT, ACF
offers a unique opportunity to expand TPT by screening a broader population for TB disease; however, most
previous ACF campaigns in high-burden countries have not included linkage to TPT. Key recent technological
innovations, including mobile chest X-ray devices, AI-based X-ray reading, and novel short-course TPT
regimens, have made mass ACF with linkage to TPT feasible for the first time, with potential for transformative
impact on TB burden. In our initial R01 study (STOMP-TB), we identified venue-based screening (VBS) as an
efficient approach to ACF in an urban Ugandan community; nearly 3% of VBS attendees had undiagnosed TB
disease. In this renewal project, we will rigorously evaluate the comparative effectiveness and implementation
of two approaches to venue-based ACF with linkage to TPT, each building on specific findings from STOMP-
TB. Specifically, we will conduct a multiple period, cluster randomized crossover trial (type 1 hybrid
effectiveness-implementation design) comparing a health facility-based approach to ACF/TPT that
incorporates existing infrastructure and patients' expressed preferences and a “hotspot”-based approach that
brings testing directly to neighborhoods experiencing the highest burden of TB. In Aim 1, we will compare the
effectiveness of hotspot-focused versus facility-based ACF/TPT in eight regions near Kampala, Uganda. Our
primary outcome will be the number of individuals initiating treatment for confirmed pulmonary TB. Secondary
analyses will include the number of people linked to TPT and notifications in the eight intervention regions
compared to four control regions. In Aim 2, we will compare implementation (reach, implementation, and
maintenance) and incremental cost-effectiveness of hotspot-focused versus facility-based ACF/TPT. In Aim 3,
we will use modeling and simulation to estimate intervention effects on the proportion of cases diagnosed, time
to TB diagnosis, and projected 10-year TB incidence and mortality. This study will provide randomized yet
pragmatic evidence to support the implementation and effectiveness of feasible approaches to TB case-finding
and preventive therapy at a critical moment when key innovations (mobile chest x-ray, AI-based interpretation,
and short-course TPT regimens) are making such interventions scalable in high-TB-burden settings."
10753502,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Almost half of the human genome is composed of repetitive DNA elements, and about three percent of
the genome is composed of microsatellites, short tandem repeats of 1-6 DNA bases. Many repeat sequences
can form alternative DNA structures that interfere with replication and repair. This can lead to disease-causing
repeat expansions, such as the CAG/CTG expansions that cause Huntington’s disease, myotonic dystrophy,
and many spinocerebellar ataxias. Breaks within structure-forming repeats cause chromosome deletions and
rearrangements, which are common in cancer cells undergoing replication stress. The goal of my laboratory is
to study mechanisms of genome instability caused by structure-forming repeats, and to elucidate cellular
pathways that have evolved to prevent these deleterious mutations. We recently discovered that long tracts of
structure-forming CAG repeats relocate to the nuclear periphery to facilitate replication through the tract and
prevent chromosome breakage and repeat expansions. This pathway depends on modification of proteins at
the replication fork by sumoylation, and subsequent interaction of the sumoylated proteins with components of
the nuclear pore complex (NPC) in late S phase, followed by release back into the nuclear interior in G2 phase.
Recent data shows that this pathway is relevant for several types of replication barriers, including protein
blocks and other structure-forming repeats. Therefore, it is vital to better understand the purpose of this
relocation to the NPC and its role in facilitating replication and preventing genome instability, which is our long-
term goal.
 We have developed a system to follow the location of an expanded CAG tract or other structure-
forming repeats in the cell nucleus using microscopy, complemented by biochemical techniques to detect
proteins interacting with the repeat locus. We will use the budding yeast (S. cerevisiae) system which allows us
to combine these approaches with the powerful genetics of the yeast system. Yeast replication and repair
pathways retain a high level of conservation with human cells, but the smaller size of the yeast genome and
proteome and wild-type (non-transformed) state of cells are advantages that will allow us to make significant
progress on our goals. We plan to elucidate the purpose of relocation of stalled replication forks to the nuclear
pore complex and the mechanisms that occur there to allow restart of replication forks, using both established
and novel approaches. We will also determine how nuclear pore-linked fork restart prevents chromosome
breaks and repeat instability and determine how repeat expansions occur during fork recovery. Our aim is to
understand NPC-dependent modification of replisome-associated proteins and fork remodeling that occurs at
replication barriers, and in so doing understand vital cellular processes that maintain genome stability. This is
important because understanding how mutations arise is critical to developing strategies to prevent their
occurrence."

Heart failure arises in large part due to the very limited ability of cardiomyocytes to regenerate following injury.
Recent studies have identified some molecular regulators of cardiomyocyte proliferation in mammals, but the
field lacks an understanding of how these and yet-to-be identified components work as a system to regulate
cardiomyocyte proliferation. A better understanding of the pathways that control CM proliferation and cell cycle
exit is needed in order to develop strategies that stimulate CM proliferation as a regenerative therapy. Here, we
integrate innovative computational and experimental methods to develop a systems-level understanding of
cardiomyocyte proliferation. First, we develop a literature-based computational model of the molecular network,
comprising known regulators of cardiomyocyte proliferation. This network model is expanded mechanistically
to include novel regulators of cardiomyocyte proliferation that we have discovered through a genome-wide
phenotypic screen, including several in a TGF-beta module. Model-predicted regulators within this TGF-beta
module are validated experimentally in mouse cardiomyocytes, human induced pluripotent stem-cell derived
cardiomyocytes, and an in vivo mouse model of cardiac regeneration. Overall, this study will provide novel
candidate therapeutic targets for cardiomyocyte proliferation, the first mechanistic model integrating these
candidates and known regulators of cardiomyocyte proliferation, and experimental validation that the model
can predict network perturbations that enhance cardiomyocyte proliferation in vitro and in vivo."

Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is the most lethal form of breast cancer with median survival of about 4 years
compared with more than 10 years for other forms of breast cancer. Poor prognosis is associated with the high
propensity of these tumors to develop distant metastases. Despite a higher incidence of certain molecular
alterations in IBC, genetic profiling studies have failed to identify a specific therapeutic target and there are
currently no FDA-approved targeted therapies that are unique for the disease. The majority of IBC tumors lack
estrogen receptor α (ERα) suggesting the potential of ERβ to mediate effects of estrogen in these tumors.
Unlike the oncogenic ERα, ERβ is associated with epithelial differentiation and decreased invasion in non-IBC.
To investigate whether ERβ has a similar role in IBC, we analyzed human tumor tissues and datasets. Our
findings are the first to indicate expression of ER in more than 50% of IBCs and correlation of the receptor
with better survival. To investigate whether this association reflects the ability of ERβ to inhibit metastasis, we
studied preclinical models of IBC. Knockout of ER in IBC cells promotes through cytoskeleton remodeling
migration and activates molecules such as RhoC that are associated with cell motility and metastasis in IBC.
Conversely, ligands that activate ER potentiate its anti-migratory activity. Consistent with the in vitro anti-
migratory activity, ERβ proficient cells are less metastatic than ERβ knockout cells during preliminary analysis
of orthotopic and lung colonization models of IBC. We, therefore, hypothesize that ERβ and its agonists
prevent progression and metastasis of IBC tumors. Our proposed research will: 1) determine the role of ERβ
and its agonists in progression and metastasis of IBC, 2) elucidate the mechanism of the anti-metastatic
activity of ERβ and 3) examine whether ERβ is inversely associated with metastasis in IBC. To investigate the
role of ERβ in metastasis of IBC, we will examine how the receptor alters the metastatic potential of IBC cells
and tumors in vitro and in vivo. We will also evaluate the efficacy of ERβ ligands, that are currently in clinical
trials, to inhibit metastasis of IBC xenografts ensuring that our studies will impact the clinical treatment of IBC
(Aim 1). Further, we will delineate the molecular mechanisms of ERβ action by analyzing specific pathways
that are implicated in disease progression and metastasis (Aim 2). Finally, we will analyze clinical samples to
validate the expression of ERβ in tumors and verify its inverse association with metastasis (Aim 3). By defining
the role of ERβ and its associated pathways in progression and metastasis of IBC our research will provide
insights into the biology of IBC and assist to better understand why these tumors become metastatic. Our
study will also have important clinical implications by establishing ERβ as a novel and specific therapeutic
target that benefits patients with IBC. Our findings can directly be translated into advances in clinical setting
because they will validate a new therapeutic compound, the ERβ ligands, that either alone or in combination
with other drugs can substantially repress IBC metastasis and eliminate its associated mortality."

 Affecting upwards of 4 million people in North America and Europe, with an economic burden of $30 -
$45 billion, Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs) are debilitating, significantly affect life-style, and carry a high
colon cancer risk. Because conventional treatment outcomes are modest with dangerous side effects, about half
of IBD patients turn to complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs). Although CAMs have been used for
thousands of years, there is a gap in our knowledge of the mechanisms supporting their effectiveness.
Understanding these mechanisms will lead to standardized treatment for IBD outside of toxic FDA-approved
drugs. This will lower their colon cancer risk. Over the past decade, we have shown that American Ginseng (AG)
suppresses colitis and prevents colon cancer in mice. Using scientifically rigorous Bioassay-Guided
Fractionation, we have isolated a polyacetylene called panaxynol (PA) that has anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer
properties. PA (compared to the100's of other CAMs being tested) comes from a natural source, and is a single
ingredient, allowing it to be standardized on its own, or in a cocktail. What makes this molecule particularly
interesting and innovative is the mechanism - it is a single molecule extracted from AG, with a unique capacity
to target macrophages (mΦ) for apoptosis. Our long-term goal is to identify the primary component(s) of AG
responsible for the robust anti-inflammatory and chemopreventive properties of AG we have observed over the
past decade; and to determine their mechanism of action. The overall objective of this application is to gain a
deeper understanding of both: (a) the broad treatment potential of PA (i.e. multiple pharmacologic and
bioengineered animal models of colitis and colon cancer); and (b) the underlying mechanism(s) behind the
observation that PA targets mΦ for apoptosis. We focus here on a DNA-damage independent p53 signaling
pathway as a mechanism toward mΦ apoptosis. The scientific premise underlying the proposed research is
robust. Comparing nine FDA-approved drugs, small molecules, and CAMs, PA is the most efficacious at
suppressing colitis in a DSS mouse model. Our central hypothesis is that PA, isolated after a decade of rigorous
bioassay-guided fractionation, has anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activity in the colon because it activates
p53- mediated apoptosis in infiltrating mΦ; mitigating colitis; and preventing colon cancer associated with colitis.
Furthermore, PA acts as an anti-inflammatory in these models because it induces p53 through a DNA damage-
like signaling response in mΦ that is independent of detectable DNA damage. To address this hypothesis, we
will test the efficacy of PA in three mouse models of colitis and in genetically engineered mice. Because it
appears that PA is taking advantage of a unique p53 mechanism in mΦ, we will test PA in mice with p53
conditionally knocked out in colonic mΦ. A DNA damage-independent mechanism is explored. Results
consistent with our hypothesis would identify an innovative, low cost, safe, specific, and natural compound with
anti-inflammatory and cancer chemopreventive properties that could quickly be implemented clinically."

interesting and innovative is the mechanism - it is a single molecule extracted from AG, with a unique capacity
to target macrophages (mΦ) for apoptosis. Our long-term goal is to identify the primary component(s) of AG
responsible for the robust anti-inflammatory and chemopreventive properties of AG we have observed over the
past decade; and to determine their mechanism of action. The overall objective of this application is to gain a
deeper understanding of both: (a) the broad treatment potential of PA (i.e. multiple pharmacologic and
bioengineered animal models of colitis and colon cancer); and (b) the underlying mechanism(s) behind the
observation that PA targets mΦ for apoptosis. We focus here on a DNA-damage independent p53 signaling
pathway as a mechanism toward mΦ apoptosis. The scientific premise underlying the proposed research is
robust. Comparing nine FDA-approved drugs, small molecules, and CAMs, PA is the most efficacious at
suppressing colitis in a DSS mouse model. Our central hypothesis is that PA, isolated after a decade of rigorous
bioassay-guided fractionation, has anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activity in the colon because it activates
p53- mediated apoptosis in infiltrating mΦ; mitigating colitis; and preventing colon cancer associated with colitis.
Furthermore, PA acts as an anti-inflammatory in these models because it induces p53 through a DNA damage-
like signaling response in mΦ that is independent of detectable DNA damage. To address this hypothesis, we
will test the efficacy of PA in three mouse models of colitis and in genetically engineered mice. Because it
appears that PA is taking advantage of a unique p53 mechanism in mΦ, we will test PA in mice with p53
conditionally knocked out in colonic mΦ. A DNA damage-independent mechanism is explored. Results
consistent with our hypothesis would identify an innovative, low cost, safe, specific, and natural compound with
anti-inflammatory and cancer chemopreventive properties that could quickly be implemented clinically."

10948087,"Project Summary/Abstract
The immune system plays an important role during tumor progression, having the ability to recognize and kill
tumor cells (T cells and NK cells) [1]. Unfortunately, these immune responses can be bypassed through a variety
of mechanisms, including creating an immune suppressive environment that alters the ability of T cells and NK
cells to inhibit tumor growth [2]. Major players in suppressing anti-tumor immune responses are immature
myeloid populations originating in the bone marrow. Several lines of evidence indicate a correlation between
increased numbers of immature myeloid populations in bone marrow, circulation and at tumor site, with disease
progression and reduced survival [3, 4]. Altered bone marrow hematopoiesis, with skewing towards
myelopoiesis, is indeed observed in cancer patients, regardless of the tumor type and/or dissemination to bone.
However, the impact of a primary tumor on bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and the factors involved
in changing their frequency and/or functionality remain to be elucidated.
Dkk1, a Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor, exerts immune suppressive effects in various cancer types, by either supporting
myeloid suppressor populations or inhibiting anti-tumor immune responses [5-7]. However, the mechanisms by
which Dkk1 induces the changes in immune populations during tumor progression are not fully understood and
evidence of direct effects of Dkk1 on mature immune cells are sparse. Interestingly, Dkk1 is required for
hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) regeneration [8], and over expression can promote long-term HSC exhaustion in
transplantation models [9]. Currently, the role of Dkk1 on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs)
during cancer progression has not been investigated. My preliminary studies show Dkk1-dependent increases
in HSPC frequencies following orthotopic injection of EO771 breast cancer cells, demonstrating systemic effects
of a primary tumor on bone marrow hematopoiesis.
Based on these observations, this training opportunity will allow me to test the hypothesis that bone derived Dkk1
alters HSPCs frequency and function to increase myelopoiesis and transform the immune landscape during
tumor progression. Thus, I propose the following aims: Aim 1: To uncover alterations to HSPCs during breast
cancer progression; and Aim 2: To investigate the role of bone derived Dkk1 on HSPCs.
These aims will reveal the impact of tumor progression on hematopoiesis and the role of the bone in orchestrating
a tumor-conducive, immune suppressive environment. The training received through this proposal will allow me
to pursue my interests in bone biology and hematology, strengthen my research skills, and allow me to develop
the skill set necessary for an Academic career at the intersection of bone biology, hematology, and immunology."
10908622,"Although a range of prenatal exposures have been linked to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes,
associations with early neurobehavioral factors related to lifetime psychopathology risk are less well studied.
Internalizing problems, most notably anxiety and depressive disorders, affect >400 million people globally with
a sharp rise in these disorders in childhood and during/after the transition to adolescence. Identifying early risk
and resiliency factors for internalizing disorders is critical to designing and implementing effective interventions
to lessen their health burden. Interactions among environment, genes, sex, and life stage influence normal and
maladaptive development. Starting in utero, the central nervous system (CNS) develops sequentially, with
specific processes and network components of distinct functional domains (e.g., attention, emotion regulation)
developing in a timed order; thus, effects of toxins depend on exposure timing as well as dose. Sex-specific effects
also exist. Moreover, pregnant women and children are exposed to complex mixtures of chemicals as well as
social stressors that co-vary and interact with each other. Differences in exposures in part drive health
inequities because toxic environmental factors are not randomly distributed, but are often concentrated in
segregated communities of color. The complexity in environmental neuroprogramming has not been fully
assessed due to a lack of sufficiently large populations with the requisite longitudinal assessments,
biosampling, and population diversity that would enable joint consideration of a number of environmental
determinants through a developmental health equity lens. Herein, we expand our site's work with the national
ECHO program to elucidate the role of complex mixtures (ambient air pollutants (APs), metals, stress, and
nutritional exposures) starting in utero, in the programming of internalizing problems that emerge over
childhood using a transdiagnostic framework. We will assess transdiagnostic (TD) dimensional features across
select Research Domain Criteria (RDoC): (1) negative valence systems, (2) cognitive systems, and (3)
arousal/regulation. We build upon methods our team developed via 3 awarded ECHO Opportunity for
Infrastructure Funding (OIF) grants that will allow researchers to more fully capitalize on the large diverse
sample, life course framework, and exposure data that ECHO provides. We will implement and disseminate
methodological advances through collaborative ECHO science including: 1) satellite remote sensing AP
models that reconstructpast exposure timing and dose; 2) novel high dimensional mixture statistics; 3)
statistical methods to characterize windows of vulnerability and enhance power to detect complex interactions
among chemicals, stress, nutrition and susceptibility factors (e.g., sex, race/ethnicity); and 4) methods to
evaluate the combinability of ECHO cohort data to optimize discovery and replication. As the complex
exposures considered herein also play a role in programming a number of health outcomes (e.g., perinatal,
respiratory, obesity, positive health), our methods will be broadly applicable to the national ECHO program."

Behavioral and social science researchers are essential for advancing research on reducing health disparities.
The next generation of such researchers must be equipped with the most powerful, contemporary analytic
tools. Newly available data and methods have the potential to transform the questions asked, the research
designs used, and the statistical approaches applied to deepen our understanding of fundamental drivers of
health and increase our capacity to improve population health and reduce disparities. To take advantage of
these opportunities, we need researchers with interdisciplinary training that allows them to connect the
traditional behavioral and social science expertise with the rapidly evolving technical repertoire of
computational health scientists. The UCSF Data Science Training to Advance Behavioral and Social Science
Expertise for Health Research (DaTABASE) program braids training strands previously operating
independently within UCSF. Particular strengths of DaTABASE include: 1) Grounding in a rigorous,
interdisciplinary quantitative training program for a foundation in study designs and statistical analyses to
deliver actionable evidence on health; 2) Integration of multiple data streams, including: ‘omics, clinical (e.g.,
UC-wide, geolocated and longitudinal medical records, clickstream data from UCSF’s unique clinical
informatics infrastructure), digital (device-based data flows, social media data, technology enabled cohorts),
population (e.g., San Francisco Department of Public Health data linking health and social services provided to
homeless individuals or other vulnerable populations) and policy data sets (e.g., local policies regulating
cannabis retail outlets in California communities); 3) training and research activities organized around the
elimination of health disparities. DaTABASE trainees will complete the rigorous methodological training for a
PhD in Epidemiology and Translational Science. Additional content training, overseen by faculty in the UCSF
Center for Health and Community, will provide theoretical frameworks and disciplinary background for social
and behavioral sciences. Additional quantitative methods training will be delivered via the Bakar Computational
Health Sciences Institute (BCHSI). BCHSI emphasizes machine learning tools to mine data sources for novel
insights and discovery, including precision medicine and population health. This training initiative will prepare
graduates to apply those analytic tools to novel data sets for research on behavioral and social processes
underlying health disparities. The DaTABASE program will provide intensive mentoring from both content and
methods experts. DaTABASE alumni will be prepared to lead research addressing current and emerging public
health challenges with innovative computational and data science analytic approaches."
10746109,"Project Summary
The overarching goal of our research is to advance understanding of the clinical utility of genetic alterations
underlying appendiceal adenocarcinoma (AA), a rare and often fatal malignancy with limited treatment options.
AA is an orphan malignancy for which there is a profound lack of both clinical trials data and molecular
understanding to guide treatment. Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) plus hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy
(HIPEC) (CRS/HIPEC, “C/H” for short) is an aggressive but effective treatment for eligible patients. C/H prolongs
the lives of eligible patients, while ineligible patients are limited to palliative chemotherapy or hospice and
experience dismal outcomes. In Aim 1, we will build on preliminary evidence that a gene-based classifier
prognostic of AA patient survival can be translated into an actionable genetic test designed to extend C/H
eligibility to a targeted population that may receive benefit, but would otherwise be ruled ineligible. This work will
utilize a statistically powered longitudinal patient cohort of AA tissues and patient clinical data and employ unique
classification strategies for training and validation. In Aim 2, we will address the considerable knowledge gap in
our molecular understanding of AA. We will characterize the prognostic mutational landscape of high-grade AA.
Through targeted exome sequencing, we will develop the first working knowledge base of the genetic alterations
that underlie appendiceal adenocarcinoma and elucidate gene mutation-survival associations with clinical
translation potential. We will also extrapolate our results to other anatomically-related gastrointstinal
malignancies to further investigate the clinical and biological implications of our findings. In Aim 3, we will
investigate genetic drivers of chemotherapy response using patient-derived tumor organoids. In these studies,
we will construct PTOs from a prospective series of AA patients and determine their clonal responses to a panel
of relevant drugs. From these data, we will elucidate significant gene-drug response associations and investigate
their functional roles in modulating chemoresistant and sensitive phenotypes. These studies will demonstrate a
novel use of PTOs for studying gene-drug response associations and identify genes and pathways that impact
drug responsiveness in AA. Together, our findings will pave the way for implementation of actionable genetic
tests to guide critical AA treatment decisions."
10746110,"ABSTRACT:
One-in-four adults hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) experience an adverse cardiac
event. Clinical epidemiological studies, as well as those performed in mice, non-human primates, and with
human autopsy samples indicate that Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn), the leading cause of CAP, can invade
the heart from the bloodstream and cause direct cardiotoxicity. Within the myocardium Spn cause focal areas
of damage we have called microlesions and these disrupt contractility. One recent break-through in our
understanding of Spn pathogenesis was the observation that pneumococci are taken up by cardiomyocytes
and Spn kill these cells from within. What is more, the pore-forming toxin pneumolysin and Streptococcal
pyruvate oxidase (SpxB) derived H2O2 were both requisite for cardiotoxicity. Herein, our goal is to gain an
understanding of the events that take place within a cardiomyocyte immediately after Spn uptake.
Along such lines, results from in vitro and in vivo experiments, including dual-species RNA sequencing of Spn-
infected hearts, have revealed highly compelling connections between changes in carbon availability, H2O2
production, biofilm / cardiac microlesion formation, and pneumolysin production. Thus, we hypothesize that
glucose restriction encountered by Spn within a cardiomyocyte, and again in cardiac microlesions, results in
metabolic and gene expression changes that enhance bacterial cardiotoxicity. To test this hypothesis and learn
how pneumolysin and H2O2 work together to kill cardiomyocytes we will:
AIM 1: Determine how environmental glucose, metabolism, and virulence are interlinked. To elucidate
the basis, extent, and consequences of these connections we will: 1) determine how purposeful shunting of
pyruvate metabolism (by means of mutation) towards the production of acetate, lactate, and/or formate impacts
gene expression under high and low glucose conditions; 2) identify how Spn gene expression changes in
longitudinal fashion after bacterial uptake by a cardiomyocyte and how this is linked to changes in Spn
metabolism; 3) determine the importance of metabolism-linked genes to Spn survival within a cardiomyocyte,
killing of the cardiomyocyte, and the overall disease process.
AIM 2: Determine how bacterial derived H2O2, together with pneumolysin, kills cardiomyocytes. SpxB
derived H2O2 and pneumolysin are both required for Spn killing of cardiomyocytes; each alone is insufficient.
To determine why we will: 1) determine how varying production of H2O2 and pneumolysin together modulate
the form of cardiomyocyte death; 2) determine if H2O2 potentiates pneumolysin production, its release from
Spn, or host cell membrane targeting; and, 3) determine if SpxB-derived H2O2 contributes to the ion
dysregulation that has previously been implicated in pneumolysin-induced necroptosis. This aim, at its
completion, will advance our understanding of how Spn kills host cells."
10746115,"Project Summary/Abstract – Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has now reached epidemic proportions worldwide. During
pre-diabetes, blood sugars rise and the risk of cardiovascular consequences, such as stroke, myocardial
infarction and mortality, is already increasing by 2-4-fold. Despite this, there remains a fundamental gap in
understanding how and why pre-diabetes develops. Strategies to halt or reverse T2D development require a
multi-pronged approach, since the pathophysiology involves both dysfunction in pancreatic β-cell glucose-
stimulated insulin release, and in skeletal muscle (skm) glucose uptake/clearance from the circulation. Factors
linked to failures in both processes are considered optimal therapeutic targets. We have identified the p21-
activated kinase, PAK1, as such a factor; it is a signaling hub in both the β-cells and skm that orchestrates
multiple aspects of glucose homeostasis. PAK1 is deficient in T2D, suggesting that its loss may be a “roadblock”
that prevents normal signaling in T2D. To overcome the roadblock of PAK1 deficiency, we need to understand
the mechanisms linking PAK1 to its functions in β-cells and skm. Our long-term goal is to understand how β-cell
and skm signaling can be manipulated to prevent or reverse pre-diabetes and halt the progression to T2D. Our
central hypothesis is that 1) signaling through the PAK1 hub in the β-cell controls functional β-cell mass to
reverse HFD-induced glucose intolerance, and that 2) PAK1 signals in skm confer protection from insulin
resistance and engage in tissue crosstalk to enhance β-cell function. The rationale for the proposed research is
that once these new mechanisms of the PAK1 effectors are elucidated, select signaling pathways from the PAK1
hub can be manipulated to prevent or reverse T2D. During the last funding cycle, we revealed that restoring
PAK1 in T2D human islet β-cells reverses dysfunctional insulin secretion while reducing β-cell mitochondrial
dysfunction and apoptosis. We also showed that PAK1 enrichment in skm protects against HFD-induced glucose
intolerance, and engages in tissue crosstalk to improve β-cell function. Our provocative new preliminary data
also indicate which PAK1 effectors carry out these essential functions. Therefore, the objective of this application
is to test these candidate mechanisms linking PAK1 effector enrichment and protection of β-cells and skm from
diabetogenic stress and to evaluate candidate PAK1 effector enrichment therapeutics. We will use our inducible
tissue-specific mouse models and human tissues/cells for these studies. In Aim 1, we will identify how the PAK1
effectors restore β-cell function; in Aim 2, we will elucidate the mechanism(s) by which PAK1-effectors protect
β-cell mass; in Aim 3, we will discern the mechanisms by which skm PAK1 contributes to peripheral insulin
sensitivity and β-cell health. We will use innovative molecular tools to test novel hypotheses about these PAK1
effector actions in the context of a translation-focused institutional environment at City of Hope. This work will
positively impact diabetes research by evaluating a promising candidate strategy to reverse pre-diabetes and
halt progression to T2D and by uncovering novel mechanisms of glucose homeostasis."
10746118,"PROJECT SUMMARY
People with low income are three times more likely to smoke than people with high income. The income disparity
in tobacco use has persisted over the past 50 years—in part because there have been limited efforts to design
cessation interventions that address the sociocontextual determinants of smoking among low-income adults.
Tobacco use not only causes extreme health consequences for low-income people, but it can also exacerbate
their financial strain by using funds on tobacco that could go towards essentials. Low-income smokers also face
unique barriers to cessation, including high levels of financial distress and other social needs, which results in
the use of smoking as a coping mechanism. Behavioral economics further finds that people experiencing
financial strain have an increased focus on immediate needs at the expense of delayed goals (such as the long-
term health benefits of cessation)—resulting in limited cognitive “bandwidth” to attend to smoking cessation.
Interventions that alleviate financial stress and help low-income smokers attend to the benefits of quitting may
improve quit rates in this vulnerable population.
We previously conducted a randomized study testing a novel intervention that integrates financial coaching into
a smoking cessation program for low-income smokers. At follow-up, intervention participants were more likely
to have quit smoking, report lower levels of financial stress, and report higher levels of financial satisfaction than
a minimal usual care control group. Our goal with the proposed R01 is to leverage the successes of the prior
study and conduct a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the effectiveness, mechanisms, and
costs of the integrated intervention against standard intensive cessation treatment. We have the following
Specific Aims: (1) Compare the effectiveness of the integrated intervention to standard cessation counseling on
long-term abstinence; (2) Identify the significant mechanisms of action of the integrated intervention; and
(3) Estimate the cost and cost-effectiveness of the integrated intervention compared to standard counseling.
To accomplish these aims, we will conduct a two-arm, parallel-group, RCT. We will recruit and randomize 900
smokers (n=450 per arm) to either: (1) Control: Standard Smoking Cessation Counseling or (2) Intervention:
Integrated Financial-Smoking Cessation Counseling. Both groups will receive 8 weeks of nicotine replacement
therapy. We will survey participants at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months to assess outcomes and
mechanisms, and biochemically verify self-reported abstinence at 12 months (our primary outcome). We will
assess and compare the cost-per-quit in the two treatment arms."
10746119,"PPROJECT ABSTRACT
More than 30 million urinary catheters (UCs) are placed every year in the US, making them the most commonly
used indwelling medical device. While short-term UC usage is common in hospitals as part of standard patient
care, chronic indwelling UCs are frequently used outside the healthcare system to improve the quality of life of
individuals with urinary tract abnormalities, such as incontinence and neurogenic bladder. UCs are associated
with high infection rates, particularly among patients with chronic indwelling UCs. Furthermore, catheter-
associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) can result in severe morbidity and increased mortality. CAUTI
caused by bacteria with high pathogenic potential such as Staphylococcus aureus, pose additional challenges
in chronically catheterized individuals. Additionally, our preliminary data suggest that S. aureus strains that cause
CAUTI produce urease. This enzyme contributes to the formation of UC encrustations, which are particularly
recalcitrant to treatment and lead to device failure. Thus, to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms that
facilitate these common infections and inform the development of effective prevention or treatment strategies,
this proposal seeks to investigate the functional and genomic role of urease in S. aureus CAUTI. My preliminary
data suggest S. aureus urease is part of the carbon catabolite protein (CcpA) regulon and contributes to CAUTI
during short UC dwell times. Furthermore, I have identified small molecule compounds that directly interact with
the urease holoenzyme, suggesting these molecules can be optimized to develop anti-virulence therapies that
inhibit urease activity and may be used to treat CAUTI caused by S. aureus or other urease-producing
uropathogens. I postulate that urease is essential for chronic S. aureus CAUTI and that the enzyme is regulated
as part of the CcpA regulon. Furthermore, I hypothesize that the increase in enzymatic activity observed in S.
aureus strains serially collected from chronically catheterized and colonized individuals is dictated by single
nucleotide polymorphisms within the regulatory elements and/or the urease operon. Using a robust collection of
clinically relevant S. aureus strains recently isolated from individuals with chronic UCs, I will investigate the
mechanisms that facilitate S. aureus CAUTI in three specific aims. First, I will examine the conserved genomic
features and define the regulatory elements that affect S. aureus urease expression and activity. Second, I will
determine the role of urease in chronic S. aureus CAUTI. Finally, I will optimize anti-virulence compounds that
inhibit this enzyme. These findings may provide the insights needed to develop non-antibiotic interventions that
treat recalcitrant CAUTIs and support the career development of a translational scientist focused on UTIs. The
University of Texas Health Science Center and Texas Medical Center has a nationally recognized research
program that offers an exceptional environment to conduct my research and receive the training needed to
transition to independence."
10746443,"Summary
The structure of a virus particle must conform to the mechanism by which it enters and infects a cell. We seek
to relate structures of virus particles and viral surface proteins to mechanisms of the steps in cell attachment,
uptake and penetration that initiate a productive infection. The proposed experiments take advantage of recent
advances in electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and live-cell imaging to define these mechanisms for both non-
enveloped and enveloped viruses, taking rotaviruses and flaviviruses (West Nile and dengue viruses, in
particular) as specific examples. Previous live-cell imaging studies defined the cellular entry pathway for
rhesus rotavirus (RRV). We can now relate structures we have determined for distinct conformations of the
spike-like viral protein 4 (VP4), which mediates cell entry, to stages of plasma-membrane remodeling in the
entry pathway. We will extend on-going analyses by cryo-EM of VP4 conformations at the membrane interface,
both on cells and in an in vitro-reconstituted system for early steps, to determine how RRV deforms and then
disrupts a membrane bilayer. A mechanism for RRV membrane perforation, suggested by preliminary data,
may help unify observations made with several other RNA viruses. Proposed experiments will connect high-
resolution structures with direct analyses (by electron cryotomography and potentially by high-resolution
template matching) of VP4 conformations during cell entry and with sequences of events in time (by lattice-
light-sheet microscopy). For the flavivirus fusion protein (the ""E protein""), completing a structure for the
postfusion conformation of the intact protein will enable design of experiments to trap fusion intermediates and
thus to define the fusion mechanism more completely than hitherto possible. The intended outcomes of the
studies, for both rotaviruses and flaviviruses, are structurally and mechanistically accurate ""molecular movies""
of viral entry."
10746445,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a common and aggressive hematologic malignancy caused by a pathologic
expansion of immature myeloid cells. Despite significant research efforts spanning 50 years, the 5-year survival
rate in AML has remain relatively unchanged at <27.4%, underscoring the need for innovative approaches to
treatment. Natural killer (NK) cells are a member of the group 1 innate lymphoid cell (ILC) family that play a
pivotal role in the detection and elimination of leukemic cells. However, we and others have previously shown
that AML is able to inhibit NK cell maturation, promoting disease progression. Mechanistically, we have shown
that AML blasts are capable of secreting agonists for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) transcription factor,
which inhibits NK cell maturation and function. Accumulating evidence suggests that AHR is required for the
maintenance of a related group 1 ILC subset termed an “ILC1.” Notably, ILC1s have been shown to be pro-
tumorigenic in solid tumor mouse models. Therefore, we hypothesize that AML is able to skew ILC populations
to suppress immune-surveillance by NK cells while promoting ILC1s. Preliminary data from our group support
this hypothesis by demonstrating that AML is capable of expanding ILC1 populations in a tissue-specific manner
in an AML mouse model. Furthermore, we predict that these ILC1s are functionally hyperactive in the setting of
AML and promote disease progression. Our long-term goal in this project is to determine how AML leads to
dysregulation of group 1 ILCs and to elucidate the downstream consequences on AML progression. Thus, our
aims are 1) to identify and characterize the mechanism(s) which promote ILC1 expansion in AML and 2) to
determine the functional consequences of expanded ILC1 populations in AML. To address these aims, we will
use a combination of ex vivo and in vivo studies. First, we will determine whether AML promotes ILC1 expansion
through interconversion from NK cells, skewing of ILC progenitors towards an ILC1 phenotype, and/or from direct
proliferation of ILC1s. We will also use transgenic mouse models to assess the contribution of Ahr and ILC1-
derived cytokines in promoting AML progression. By identifying these mechanisms, we will be able to better
target these pathways to restore group 1 ILC homeostasis and inform the development of future immune-based
therapies. This project represents a novel and innovative approach to targeted therapy in AML by focusing on
how leukemia targets ILC populations, an area which has been understudied to date. Successful completion of
these studies will fill in critical knowledge gaps of how ILCs are dysregulated in AML and how these cells can be
targeted therapeutically to improve patient survival."
10866386,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Lipodystrophies are rare diseases, characterized by a striking loss, redistribution, and dysfunction of adipose
tissue, and accompanied by metabolic dysfunction. Familial partial lipodystrophy 2 (FPLD2) is the most
common type of lipodystrophy, caused by mutations in LMNA, which encodes the nuclear lamina proteins
lamin A/C. Lamin A/C is crucial for nuclear function and controls gene expression, but its role in adipocyte
maintenance and function is incompletely understood. Our lab created a constitutive adipocyte specific Lmna
knockout mouse model (LmnaADKO) to better characterize the roles of Lmna in adipocytes. LmnaADKO mice
develop adipose tissues that are subsequently lost starting at 4 weeks of age; LmnaADKO mice have hepatic
steatosis and reduced circulating leptin concentrations, closely recapitulating FPLD2. Analyses of LmnaADKO
mice suggest that lamin A/C is required for adipocyte maintenance, substantially advancing our mechanistic
understanding, since previous studies did not reveal how loss of Lmna function leads to lipodystrophy.
To study mechanisms of how knockout of Lmna in adipocytes leads to subsequent loss of adipocytes, we
generated mice in which Lmna can be inducibly knocked out with administration of tamoxifen (LmnaiADKO). This
approach allows us to use adult mice, which have more adipose tissue, and to temporally synchronize
adipocyte loss. In preliminary experiments, we have tested multiple mechanisms in vivo that could contribute to
loss of adipocytes in LmnaiADKO mice. Altered adipogenesis seems unlikely, considering that functional white
adipose tissue (WAT) develops in LmnaADKO mice and patients with FPLD2. We also did not observe signs of
increased lipolytic capacity or increased acute cell death in WAT lacking Lmna in adipocytes. However, we did
observe that adipocytes lacking Lmna are visibly smaller and misshapen compared to controls, suggesting
adipocytes are losing their lipid stores, and are unable to maintain viability. Bulk RNA-seq and proteomics from
LmnaiADKO WAT revealed downregulation of lipogenic pathways, and upregulation of inflammatory genes. We
hypothesize that lamin A/C is required to maintain mature adipocyte characteristics, and that absence of
functional lamin A/C leads to adipocyte loss through reduced lipogenic gene expression, driven by altered
interactions between Lmna and chromatin. My project will test this hypothesis by (1) evaluating changes in
lipogenic and mitochondrial genes in Lmna knockout adipocytes and performing DamID and FISH to study
changes in chromatin-lamina interactions that may underlie changes in gene expression and (2) assessing
decreased de novo lipogenesis in LmnaiADKO mice, in addition to restoring lipogenic gene expression to Lmna
KO adipocytes to prevent WAT loss. Ultimately, these studies will reveal underlying molecular mechanisms of
FPLD2, uncovering novel therapeutic targets for lipodystrophy patients while bolstering our understanding of
fundamental adipocyte biology."

after acute injury by reprogramming Müller glia into stem-like cells that produce retinal progenitors.
This regenerative process fails to occur in zebrafish models of IRDs. This proposal will address the
critical unanswered question as to why zebrafish mutants with chronic inflammation fail to regenerate.
Our preliminary data show that Notch pathway inhibition can promote photoreceptor regeneration in
the zebrafish cep290 and bbs2 models of progressive degeneration and that immunosuppression
prevents photoreceptor loss. These results offer insight into the pathways that promote Müller glia-
dependent regeneration and the role of inflammation in photoreceptor degeneration. Our central
hypothesis is that in zebrafish models of retinal degeneration, chronic inflammation results in elevated
Notch and NF-kB signaling that restricts the regenerative response to acute injury. Evidence from the
literature and our preliminary data rigorously demonstrate that Notch signaling in Müller glia differs in
response to acute injury or chronic degeneration. Understanding the link between pro-inflammatory
signaling from microglia and Notch signaling in Müller glia has not been previously addressed.
Furthermore, our current understanding of how inflammatory cytokines signal through the NF-kB
pathway has only been studied in the context of wild-type animals. The proposed studies will provide
critical insight into the relationship between microglia and Müller glia regeneration in chronic disease.
We will use state-of-the-art sequencing technologies to identify Müller glia- and microglia-specific
changes in gene expression in cep290 and bbs2 models in order to elucidate the relationship
between inflammation and regeneration. We will also identify and test specific ligand-receptor pairs
to identify the mechanisms that maintain Notch signaling in the zebrafish degeneration mutants and
identify key factors that stimulate NF-kB signaling. Understanding the mechanisms that underpin
retinal regeneration in multiple zebrafish disease models will generate novel hypotheses that can
ultimately be translated into humans with retinal degenerative diseases."

Surface-associated microbial populations are ubiquitous in nature and display evolutionary
dynamics that are not yet well characterized, despite their importance to human health and
technology. Genetic drift, the change in allele abundances due to chance alone, is known to be
much more important in the surface-associated scenario than for microbes in well-mixed liquid
media, but it is unknown which properties of cells and populations modulate this effect. I
performed an evolutionary range expansion experiment with the budding yeast, Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, to investigate how cells evolve when selected for more efficient surface-associated
growth. We found that cells selected for faster expansion on surfaces evolved an elongated cell
shape and a bipolar budding pattern, in which daughter cells bud at the pole opposite to the birth
scar. Additionally, preliminary results suggest that evolved colonies display increased genetic drift
compared to the ancestor. This proposal aims to understand the genetic changes that caused
these phenotypes, and how these phenotypes modify the physical parameters of the system to
enable faster expansion. Further, I will use this information to understand how properties of single
cells affect the relative strength of natural selection and genetic drift in dense cellular aggregates.
I hypothesize that the faster expansion is the result of evolved changes in physical
properties of the colony that modify the way cells interact with each other and the agar
surface. Additionally, I hypothesize that an elongated cell shape contributes to an
increased strength of genetic drift in surface-associated growth. I will address this
hypothesis by identifying the genes that cause each evolved phenotype, characterizing the
physical properties of colonies and cells that affect expansion dynamics and three-dimensional
colony structure, and finally use this information to assess the effect of each phenotypic change
on the relative strength of genetic drift in expanding colonies. Completion of these goals will
ensure I have developed expertise in both theoretical and experimental approaches pivotal to
independent biophysical research with health-related applications, a major goal of my fellowship
training plan. My training plan also includes training in scientific communication and inclusive
teaching and mentorship. I will benefit from the significant resources granted to me by Cornell in
the way of on-site, state-of-the-art research facilities, collaboration with experts specific to all fields
represented in my research, and a wonderfully supportive research advisor, the sponsor of this
work."

 Cardiac arrhythmia is a condition where the heart’s electrical signals are disrupted, causing the heart to
beat in an irregular and dyssynchronous manner. While some arrhythmias may be benign, others can be life-
threatening, as the ability of the heart to perfuse the vital organs with oxygen and nutrients is severely
compromised. Small conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (SK channels) are activated by the
increase of intracellular calcium concentrations on a beat-to-beat basis. SK channels play critical roles in the
regulation of cardiac excitability, and dysfunction of cardiac SK channels causes cardiac arrhythmias including
atrial fibrillation (AF). Therefore, SK channel may represent a novel therapeutic target for cardiac arrhythmias.
The regulation mechanisms of cardiac SK channels have been extensively studied. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-
bisphosphate (PIP2) is an essential regulator of many plasma membrane-bound proteins, including cardiac ion
channels. Hence, PIP2 may play critical roles in arrhythmia initiation and maintenance. However, whether and
how cardiac SK channels are regulated by PIP2 are still unknown. We hypothesize that SK channels are
regulated by PIP2 in cardiomyocytes and PIP2 plays a critical role in the trafficking of SK channels. To test the
hypothesis, we will use multidisciplinary approaches including patch-clamp, total internal reflection fluorescence
(TIRF) microscopy, super-resolution immunofluorescence imaging, optogenetics and genetic manipulations.
Three specific aims are: (1) determine the regulation of SK channels by PIP2 using optogenetic techniques; (2)
determine the molecular mechanisms of PIP2 regulation of SK channels; (3) test the physiological impact of PIP2
regulation in cardiomyocytes. These studies will reveal a new regulatory mechanism of cardiac SK channels by
PIP2. The anticipated results will provide novel insights into the functional role of SK channels and PIP2 signaling
in the regulation of cardiac excitability and arrhythmia. At the translational level, cardiac SK channels may
represent a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmia."

):   Palliative care is an approach to medical care that focuses on helping patients and families live well with persistent and serious illnesses through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other problems, physical, psychosocial and spiritual. Neuropalliative care is an emerging field of medicine dedicated to improving the quality of care for people living with neurological disorders and their families using a palliative care framework. The International Neuropalliative Care Society (INPCS) was founded in 2021 to foster growth in this field by creating a community that is interdisciplinary (embracing the full spectrum of disciplines involved in neuropalliative care), person-centered ( inviting persons living with these disorders and their families to have an equal seat at the table) and international (embracing the concept that we can learn from different models of care and that people living everywhere deserve access to high-quality palliative care). The Neuropalliative Care Research Symposium (NeuroCaReS) will be held at The Slate Denver in Denver, Colorado on April 12 and 13, 2024, directly preceding the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN). The INPCS has committed funds to partially support this symposium. The overall goal of this interdisciplinary research symposium is to bring together a diverse group of stakeholders including clinicians, researchers, and patient/family advocates with a common interest in understanding and advancing patient-reported outcomes research in Neuropalliative care. The symposium is unique in that it will provide a forum to present and discuss (1) the latest advances in clinical study design and research tools, including behavioral research methodologies for intervention development and implementation using the NIH stage model and Science of Behavior Change (SOBC); (2) methods to reduce racial inequities in healthcare and research and improve diversity, equity, and inclusion in neuropalliative care research; and to (3) train the next generation of neuropalliative care investigators. The need for the design of adequate research studies and uniform data collection in Neuropalliative Care will also be addressed. The symposium will consist of three round table discussions, six scientific sessions, and three junior investigator mentoring workshops. We anticipate approximately 60 attendees. The Organizing Committee consists of the co-directors of the INPCS research committee. Invited speakers include members of the neuropalliative care research community but with various research interests that represent the integrated educational concept of the conference. At the conclusion of the conference, participants should be able to: 1) understand the importance and opportunities for Neuropalliative care research; 2) discuss recent scientific advances related to the assessment of outcomes and interventions that will have an impact on Neuropalliative care research; 3) determine future directions of Neuropalliative research with a focus on equity-oriented and race-conscious research; and 4) enhance collaboration of researchers in the broad space of palliative care. All presentations will be videotaped and presented on the INPCS website for general public access (the website has been established since 2021). Furthermore, invited speakers will be asked to submit manuscripts related to their topic for peer review and publication in the Annals of Palliative Medicine."
10908296,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alcohol use and misuse is a leading cause of preventable death in the United States (US). Decades of research
have identified individual-level and environmental characteristics that are associated with alcohol use and thus
can be modified to reduce population alcohol consumption. Alcohol outlet density is one such environmental
characteristic that has been a focus of substantial research in the US and around the world. While many agencies
and organizations have used this research to promote policy advocating for modifications in alcohol outlet
density, such as through changes in licensing and zoning, the science is far from settled. The findings of the
relationship between outlet density and alcohol consumption are contradictory when examining individual-level
and ecological level studies and the effect of every additional alcohol outlet on alcohol consumption also remains
unclear. The lack of consensus on the true relationship between alcohol outlet density and alcohol consumption
points to the need for rigorous individual-level studies that incorporate characteristics that impact an individual’s
decision to travel to an alcohol outlet and the multiscale nature of alcohol consumption with risk factors lying on
multiple levels. The objective of this study is to create a new measurement of the alcohol environment — a
responsive buffer — that incorporates the decades of research identifying characteristics that impact alcohol
use. The specific aims of this study are to (1) conduct an updated systematic review of research studying the
impact of alcohol outlet density on alcohol consumption or related harm published from November 2014 to
November 2023 to synthesize the findings of ecological and individual-level studies, alcohol outlet density
measurements, methodological advances, scientific rigor, and methodological limitations, (2) compare the distance
individuals travel to alcohol outlets using GPS travel data and use this information to develop responsive buffers
for assessing exposure to alcohol outlets, and (3) characterize associations between alcohol outlet density of
responsive buffers with individual-level alcohol consumption (i.e., number of drinking days, quantity consumed)
and compare effect sizes to commonly used measurements of alcohol outlet density (e.g., census tracts, ZIP codes,
400 m buffer around residence). The proposed aims and training plan build upon my experience in alcohol research
supplemented by focused training in alcohol epidemiology, spatial epidemiology and neighborhood research
techniques for mobility studies and momentary assessments of exposure and analyses of hierarchically structured
data. This research and development of a new method has important implications for environmental prevention
efforts aimed to improve population health by decreasing alcohol consumption. By creating an innovative
measurement of the alcohol environment, this research will improve the translation of evidence-based research to
alcohol prevention policy and promote the NIAAA’s mission to inform regulatory efforts and policy that create
environments for healthy lives and well-being for all."

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a class of heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders that
affects 1 in 54 children in the United States and is characterized by impaired social cognition,
repetitive behaviors and seizure risk. Genetic studies and large-scale exome-sequencing efforts
have identified haplo-insufficient loss of function (LOF) mutations in the Dual specificity
tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase Dyrk1a gene in syndromic ASD. However, the
functional impact of hemizygous Dyrk1a LOF on synaptic and circuit mechanisms underlying
social cognition remain poorly understood. This challenge is magnified because Dyrk1a
phosphorylates >70 substrates and Dyrk1a LOF is likely to disrupt many biological processes
during development. Currently, there are no drugs that enhance or restore Dyrk1a function.
Together, these observations underscore the need to identify cell-type and circuit-specific
mechanisms that maybe targeted to reverse Dyrk1a associated social cognition impairments. This
proposal seeks to bridge these gaps by identifying a Dyrk1a-dependent synaptic and circuit
mechanism mediating social recognition that can be targeted in adulthood to reverse
developmental loss of Dyrk1a-associated impairments in social cognition circuitry and behavior.
The proposed Aims will build on our in vivo functional genetic epistasis analysis of Dyrk1a and
one of its substrates, Ablim3, in hippocampal mossy fibers to test the role of this pathway in
reversing circuit and social recognition memory impairments in adult Dyrk1a hemizygous mice
that models Dyrk1a haploinsufficiency in ASD. Execution of the Aims harbors potential to guide
gene therapy strategies targeting molecular and circuit substrates of Dyrk1a, Ablim3 and
parvalbumin inhibitory neuron mediated GABAergic inhibition, in the adult brain as “Dyrk1a
enhancers” to rescue social cognition impairments in ASD resulting from Dyrk1a
haploinsufficiency."

Myeloid dendritic cells (DC) are a critical lineage of innate immunity that serve as a principal point of contact and
crosstalk between the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. CTLA-4 is one of the best characterized
of the immune checkpoint proteins, molecules that serve to balance, regulate, and fine-tune immune activation
with homeostatic inhibition. CTLA-4 is expressed by all major lymphoid lineage effectors; however, its function-
ality has been best characterized in T-cells where it exhibits both cell-extrinsic and cell-intrinsic regulatory func-
tions. Until recently, very little was known about CTLA-4 expression or function in non-lymphoid cell types, par-
ticularly the myeloid lineage dendritic cell subsets. In the original iteration of this renewal application, we provided
preliminary data demonstrating that DC-secreted CTLA-4+ exosomes could bind B7 in paracrine fashion, leading
to vesicle internalization and subsequent downregulation of B7 expression among bystander DC that internalized
the CTLA-4+ exosomes. Conversely, knockdown of DC-expressed CTLA-4 resulted in a dramatic upregulation
of co-cultured CD8+ cell proliferation in vitro as well as enhanced antitumor and antiviral immunity in vivo. These
discoveries and concomitant characterization of myeloid CTLA-4 expression signified a paradigm shift in the
understanding of CTLA-4’s role in immune governance as well as the mechanisms through which innate and
adaptive crosstalk occur. Subsequent data indicated that the expression of DC CTLA-4 is modulated in response
to TH polarizing cues and that regulation in DC appears to be governed in part by the transcription factors GATA3
and C/EBP-b. Further, conditional ablation of CTLA-4 in the C57BL/6 background revealed potential new roles
for DC expressed CTLA-4 in regulatory processes in the thymus and in other lymphoid tissues including Peyer’s
patches. These novel and exciting data have allowed formulation of a refined overarching hypothesis that DC-
secreted CTLA-4+ exosomes act as effector vehicles that shape downstream TH polarization of adaptive re-
sponses as dictated by DC detection of innate signaling cues. By means of three independent aims we will test
this overarching hypothesis by i) defining the role of TH polarizing cues in the governance of DC CTLA-4 expres-
sion and the governance of the CEBP/b and GATA3 transcriptional regulators, ii) defining the mechanisms
through which DC-secreted CTLA-4+ and CTLA-4neg exosomes regulate downstream adaptive TH polarization,
and iii) defining the manner by which DC CTLA-4 expression modulates central tolerance by interrogating the
regulatory T-cell deficits observed in the CD11c-Cre CTLA-4flox/flox C57BL/6 mouse. Completion of these inde-
pendent aims will further elucidate the novel regulatory role of myeloid CTLA-4, furthering the ability to synthesize
effective and powerful vaccination strategies while characterizing critical druggable target interactions and en-
hancing the understanding of complex biological pathways."
10754299,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
The RAS genes KRAS, NRAS, or HRAS, are commonly mutated in human cancers. Clinically
inhibiting RAS has proven challenging and RAS-mutant cancers remain some of the most
intractable diseases, even to immunotherapies. It is thus critical to elucidate oncogenic RAS
signaling, not only to better understand the tumorigenic process, but also to identify new potential
therapeutic targets. To this end, I exploited the novel technique of BirA-mediated proximity
labeling to identify proteins within the immediate vicinity (interactome) of each RAS isoform. I then
screened an sgRNA library targeting interactome components for genes promoting RAS
transformed cell growth, identifying the druggable phosphatidylinositol phosphate lipid kinase
PIP5K1A as specifically driving KRAS oncogenesis. PIP5K1A represents an entirely new
therapeutic target in KRAS-mutant cancers, and suggests that other proteins in the RAS
interactome may similarly mediate RAS oncogenesis. I will capitalized on these discoveries in
three aims. As PIP5K1A is a druggable kinase it provides a way to specifically inhibit KRAS
oncogenesis, which could be exploited to enhance the antineoplastic activity of drugs targeting
RAS effector pathways. Thus, in aim 1 I will elucidate the role and therapeutic potential of
targeting PIP5K1A in KRAS-mutant cancers. The identification of PIP5K1A promoting KRAS
oncogenesis suggests that other interactome proteins may similarly mediate RAS function. Thus,
in aim 2 I will mine the RAS interactome for novel modifiers of RAS oncogenesis, focusing on the
interactome protein EFR3A as a potential general mediator of oncogenic RAS-driven
tumorigenesis. Finally, the RAS interactome is most certainly dynamic, varying under different
conditions. Determining the content of the RAS interactome under distinct settings may thus
identify new vulnerabilities specific to diverse cellular conditions. Thus, in aim 3 I will probe the
RAS interactome in response to cellular perturbations. In sum, I will expand upon my discovery
that PIP5K1A promotes KRAS oncogenesis to explore this kinase as a new therapeutic target and
identify other novel therapeutic vulnerabilities that exists within the RAS interactome. The K99
segment of this grant will complete my training in RAS signal transduction, extend my training
into phosphoproteomics, xenograft and genetically engineered mouse models of tumorigenesis.
The R00 segment will capitalize on the use of proximity labeling to study the dynamic
nature of oncogenic RAS signaling. My long-term goal is to transition into an independent
investigator and apply systems biology approaches to uncover the signaling circuitry of
oncogene drivers with the objective of identifying novel therapeutic vulnerabilities in RAS-mutant
cancers."

Bicyclic peptides are conformationally constrained peptides comprised of two macrocyclic rings. Owing to their
increased rigidity, bicyclic peptides can bind to protein targets with greater affinity and selectivity than their linear
and monocyclic counterparts. As a result, these molecules are highly desirable scaffolds for the development of
peptide-based therapeutics. Phage display is a laboratory evolution technique that enables the discovery of high-
affinity peptide ligands from large, combinatorial peptide libraries. Although initially limited to linear peptides, this
technique has been adapted for the discovery of bicyclic peptide ligands. Most often, phage-displayed bicyclic
peptides are generated by chemically modifying linear peptides using cysteine-reactive small molecules; how-
ever, this method is technically challenging. As a result, progress in this field has been limited. Recently, several
studies have used genetic code expansion to co-translationally install cysteine-reactive noncanonical amino
acids (ncAAs) into phage-displayed peptides to produce libraries of cyclic peptides. This strategy has significant
advantages over the chemical cyclization approach, but is currently limited to monocyclic peptides. The over-
arching objective of this proposal is to develop technology that enables phage display of bicyclic pep-
tides using genetic code expansion. Our central hypothesis is that bifunctional ncAAs, i.e. ncAAs containing
two cysteine-reactive functional groups, can be used to generate ribosomally synthesized bicyclic peptides by
intramolecular reaction with cysteine residues. To realize our objective, we will pursue three Specific Aims. In
Aim 1 (K99 Phase) we will engineer an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase that recognizes bifunctional ncAAs contain-
ing two cysteine-reactive moieties. This will be accomplished using traditional and state-of-the-art methods of
directed evolution. In Aim 2 (K99/R00 Phase) we will develop a phage display system that is compatible with co-
translational installation of bifunctional ncAAs and we will optimize this system for bicyclic peptide formation. We
will then validate this system by selecting and characterizing ligands for model targets. In Aim 3 (R00 Phase) we
will use phage display to identify bicyclic peptides that bind to the spike protein of human coronaviruses and
inhibit virus-host membrane fusion. By targeting proteins from various coronaviruses, we will strive to identify
inhibitors with broad-spectrum antiviral activity. The proposed work will provide a facile route for generating bi-
cyclic peptide libraries thereby greatly accelerating the discovery of therapeutic peptide leads. The Candidate,
Dr. Jeffery Tharp’s long-term career goal is to establish an independent research program that uses genetic
code expansion and phage display to develop antiviral peptides for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of
infectious diseases. Herein we propose a detailed five-year Career Development Plan supervised by mentors
Drs. Dieter Söll and Craig Wilen, and a team of subject-matter experts. This plan will augment previous training
and address key training gaps to prepare Dr. Tharp for accomplishing his long-term career goal."

Billions of people are at risk of contracting vector-borne diseases. Dengue alone causes 90 million infections
per year globally and like many vector-borne diseases, currently there are no drugs or vaccines to treat or prevent
these infections. Therefore, vector control is the primary tool used for vector-borne disease prevention. In
recent years, novel vector population suppression technologies have been created (e.g. RIDL and Wolbachia
based systems), but production of mosquitoes for these programs is labor intensive and is limited in scalability
and distribution. In this study, we will use a functional genomic screening approach to identify key sex
determinate, female essential (FE) and male fertility (MF) genes in the dengue vector, Ae. aegypti. These studies
will improve our understanding of the biology of this important vector and it can be used to inform the design of
new genetic population suppression methods to control this vector. After these genes are identified and
characterized, we will incorporate them into the design of precision guided sterile insect technique (pgSIT)
technologies in an attempt to overcome limitations in traditional SIT control strategies. Sterile insect technique
(SIT) is the gold standard for insect population control but has many limitations. Our proposed technology aims
to simultaneously knock-out FE and MF genes using a binary CRISPR/Cas9 system in the Ae. aegypti disease
vector. One line will target one or more female essential FE genes and one or more MF genes and the other
line will express a Cas9. When these two lines are crossed, they create sterile, male progeny that are ready for
release into a population suppression program. To generate these lines, initially we will characterize >40
candidate FE and MF genes A. aegypti in single and combinatorial sgRNA screening assays in our previously
characterized Cas9 expression. These genes will be initially selected through transcriptomics, comparative
genomics and functional genomic studies. Gene targets that exhibit consistent FE or MF phenotypes will then
be engineered into transgenic Ae. aegypti line expressing guide RNAs (gRNA) targeting these genes. These
lines will then be crossed to multiple Cas9 lines and the fitness of each line and their F1 progeny will be
determined over many generations to ensure population stability. The design and integration of these
transgenes will then be varied and optimized to facilitate improved, stable and consistent phenotypes. These
optimization experiments will also address multiple fundamental questions about lethal biallelic mosaicism, a
phenomenon identified as driving pgSIT success in D. melanogaster, and endogenous Cas9 expression
systems, including the impact of transgene expression timing and transgene location on the long-term stability
of the lines. The optimal design and genes will then be evaluated in fitness and small population cage studies.
In the end, we aim to identify novel FE and MF genes that will allow us to better understand mosquito biology
and which allow us to create a genetic SIT system that improves upon traditional SIT technologies."
10750938,"Encephalitic flavivirus infections affect thousands of people globally every year causing acute encephalomyelitis and placing significant burden on healthcare systems. Currently, no virus-specific treatments are available for these life-threatening conditions. The central nervous system (CNS) encompasses dozens of cell types with diverse properties and functions. Limited by a lack of adequate tools that combine throughput, depth and resolution, the interactions between viruses and this complex environment remain largely a mystery. To complicate matters, the CNS is also extensively connected to the periphery by both physical neural projections and peripheral immune signaling. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that tropism of the important encephalitic virus West Nile (WNV) within the CNS after direct intracranial inoculation of mice differs from that seen after spread to the CNS following peripheral infection. We hypothesize that CNS tropism is largely determined by resident neural and glial innate immune profiles, which can be readily modified by immune signals generated during peripheral infection. To address this hypothesis, we will utilize WNV to study immune interactions between cell types in an in vivo mouse model and in vitro using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) models. Tissue clearing techniques and whole mount imaging will be used to visualize viral antigens across the entire brain and spinal cord using light sheet microscopy, creating a complete time-resolved 3-dimensional map of infection. Responses of single cells will be examined using a combination of cutting-edge nuclear RNA sequencing and microscopy-based spatial transcriptomics. Co-cultures of hPSC-derived neurons and glia will be interrogated using high-throughput microscopy and sequencing to identify resistance factors and responses in human cell types. Hits will be mechanistically studied using blocking antibodies and CRISPR-mediated knockouts. Lastly, by using systemic and cell-type specific knock out animals or cytokine neutralizing antibodies, we will investigate the role of type I interferon in modulating CNS tropism and disease. This project will provide new data on flaviviral encephalitis at unparalleled resolution to help bridge current information gaps and improve fundamental knowledge by defining cellular tropism and CNS inflammatory responses at the single cell level and evaluating how changes in peripheral signaling influence infection of the brain. Identified peripheral factors restricting CNS infection are possible targets for immunomodulatory therapy, thus promoting research that may improve treatment for other forms of viral encephalitis. Finally, the resulting experimental pipeline will be broadly applicable to the study of CNS stress and inflammation, with relevance to other diseases like Lyme neuroborreliosis or chronic debilitating conditions like traumatic brain injury."
11006250,"Regulation of cerebral blood flow is necessary for survival as the brain requires a large amount of circulating
oxygen and nutrients. Resistance-size cerebral arteries manage constant blood flow to the brain by myogenic
autoregulation mechanisms. Abnormal cholesterol levels trigger dysregulation of resistance-size cerebral
arteries via the calcium- and voltage-gated potassium channel of large conductance (BK), contributing to
common cerebrovascular pathologies such as stroke, cognitive deficits including some forms of dementia, and
the disruption of cerebral artery function by recreational alcohol. Cholesterol inhibition of the BK channel alters
contractility of vascular smooth muscle impacting cerebral artery diameter, and dysregulates delivery of oxygen
and nutrients throughout the brain. While cholesterol diminishes BK channel activity, the molecular
mechanism(s) by which this occurs are currently unknown. Cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid
consensus (CRAC) motifs are potential binding sites for cholesterol, and ten are found throughout the BK channel
amino acid sequence. The cytosolic tail domain contains seven of these ten CRAC motifs, and it has been
demonstrated that cholesterol modulates BK currents by one or more of these cytosolic tail domain CRAC motifs.
My goal is to determine the molecular mechanisms that govern cholesterol regulation of the BK channel by
interacting with certain cytosolic tail domain CRAC motif(s), and to define the impact of this regulation on cerebral
artery diameter. This proposal addresses two main aims: Aim 1 will determine the structural basis and gating
mechanisms that lead to cholesterol-induced hindering of BK function through cholesterol direct interactions with
the BK channel-forming slo1 subunit. The hypothesis that cholesterol modulates BK currents via interaction with
specific CRACs will be addressed by electrophysiology and binding experiments. I will also identify which BK
gating parameter(s) are altered upon cholesterol interaction. 1.1. I will first determine the contribution of distinct
CRAC motifs to cholesterol binding and the consequent inhibition of homomeric slo1 channel activity. 1.2. Next,
I will determine the critical physicochemical features of distinct CRAC motifs that allow for modulation of the
channel’s cholesterol sensitivity. 1.3. Finally, I will identify the cholesterol-sensitive gating parameters that lead
to cholesterol-induced hindering of slo1 channel activity. Aim 2 will address the physiological and
pharmacological consequences of cholesterol-slo1 interactions via CRAC4 motif as an example on native BKs
in cerebral artery smooth muscle and cerebral artery diameter. 2.1. I will determine the effects of cholesterol
interactions with CRAC4 in native BKs in arterial myocytes under physiological conditions. 2.2. I will also
determine the consequences of cholesterol regulation of BK currents via slo1 CRAC4 on artery diameter. This
proposal will for the first time develop a unifying scheme that explains the actions of cholesterol on BK channel
function and cerebral artery diameter at both molecular and cellular levels based on direct binding of the sterol
to the BK channel-forming slo1 subunit and/or allosteric regulation secondary to the sterol interaction."

Mechanistic target of Rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) integrates inputs from multiple pathways and
senses diverse signals to regulate cell growth, protein translation, and proliferation1,2. Given that spatial
compartmentalization can enhance signaling specificity and efficiency3,4, spatial regulation of mTORC1 appears
to be critical for this multifaceted signaling complex5 as it has been reported at many subcellular locations6–9.
For example, mTORC1 at the lysosome is regulated by both amino acids and growth factors and functions to
promote translation and suppress autophagy10. The complex has also been identified at peroxisomes, where
mTORC1 responds to reactive oxygen species7. However, the roles of mTORC1 at other subcellular locations
where its presence has been reported, in particular in the nucleus, are not well understood. A major limitation in
the field is the availability of tools to assess the activity and function of spatially compartmentalized signaling
enzymes in living cells. Using a genetically encoded fluorescent biosensor to monitor mTORC1 activity, the
Zhang lab has previously discovered a pool of nuclear mTORC1, which has yet to be defined in function. Based
on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that nuclear mTORC1 regulates pro-inflammatory transcription. We will
test this hypothesis by combining targeted inhibition of mTORC1 with a phosphoproteomics experiment and
biochemical assays. Lastly, since genetic mutations activating phosphoinositide 3-kinase(PI3K)/protein kinase
B (Akt)/mTOR signaling are prominent alterations in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)11,12 and mTORC1
inhibition can induce tumor regression13,14, we will study the role of subcellular mTORC1 signaling in the growth
and drug resistance of OSCC cells in vitro and in vivo in mice. We hypothesize that inhibiting mTORC1 in the
nucleus or the cytosol will differentially effect cell growth and EGFR inhibitor resistance in OSCC. The proposed
project will elucidate the function of the previously undefined pool of nuclear mTORC1 and clarify the roles of
subcellular mTORC1 in the growth and drug resistance of OSCC."

Vimentin intermediate filaments augment cytoskeletal deformability and directed migration of
individual mesenchymal cells, but their role in multicellular migration, tractions, and coordination is
poorly understood. Such collective migration of mechanically connected cells is crucial for embryonic
development, wound healing, and tumor invasion. Gain of vimentin is associated with the epithelial-
mesenchymal transition (EMT), where tightly-connected epithelial cells downregulate cell-cell adhesions and
acquire an individual mesenchymal phenotype. However, cells that migrate collectively in groups can also
express vimentin in combination with cell-cell junctions (e.g. cadherins). For instance, “leader cells” at wound
fronts can exhibit an elongated morphology with vimentin, while remaining partially connected to migratory
followers. Given these questions, there exists a critical need to elucidate the role of vimentin in leader cells
and its contributions to collective cell migration.
 Our overall objective is to elucidate the functional role of vimentin in leader and follower cells for directed
cell motility, multicellular tractions, and cell-cell coordination. In particular, we consider several fundamental
questions: 1) How does vimentin affect confined migration and cellular deformability? 2) How does vimentin
affect collective tractions? 3) How does vimentin affect cell-cell adhesions and coordinated motility? 4) How do
vimentin-high and vimentin-low cells interact during collective migration?
 Our approach will integrate several complementary technologies for precision measurement of collective
cell migration and mechanobiology. MPI: Guo is an Early Stage Investigator with extensive expertise in the
mechanics of soft and living materials, including vimentin networks and extracellular matrix. MPI: Wong is an
Early Stage Investigator with extensive expertise in collective migration and EMT, particularly single cell
tracking and analyses. Co-I: Goldman is a leader in the molecular biology of vimentin. This proposal is
structured around 3 aims: elucidate how vimentin affects cell shape, migration and deformability of multicellular
collectives in confinement (AIM 1), multicellular tractions in 3D matrix (AIM 2), and collective interactions of
“mosaic” spheroids with heterogeneous vimentin expression (AIM 3). Overall, this work will reveal new
fundamental insights into the role of vimentin in cell shape, motility, and mechanical integrity in collective
migration, with potential implications for tissue morphogenesis and tumor dissemination."

metastatic microenvironment (PMM) composed of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, deposited by resident
stromal cells, that enhance metastasis. To date, PMM development has been studied solely in the context of
highly metastatic tumor models using cell lines rich in tumor suppressor and oncogene mutations, however no
direct mechanistic connections between metastatic driver genes and PMM formation have yet been deciphered.
Obscurins have recently been pinned as potent metastasis suppressors in breast cancer. Biochemical evidence
from our group has mechanistically linked obscurin loss to PI3K/Akt2 activation in breast epithelial cells, driving
oncogenesis and metastatic spread. However, no study has yet drawn the connection between the loss of
obscurin in breast epithelia and PMM development. This study will test the novel hypothesis that loss of obscurin
in breast epithelia primes vascular smooth muscle cell (vSMC)-derived fibronectin and collagen 1a1 deposition
in the PMM through secreted factors, potentiating metastasis.
 The goal of my application is to investigate the potential of obscurin-deficient breast epithelia secreted
factors (OBEFs) to drive vSMC ECM fibronectin and collagen 1a1 deposition. OBEFs will be isolated from
OBSCN knock-out (KO) MCF10A cell clones, while the human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (HPASMC)
line will be the representative PMM cell population for the following reasons: 1) Lung PMM development is
dependent on phenotypically activated lung vSMC-derived ECM production, and 2) Pre-metastatic lung, vSMC-
derived ECM has been shown to enhance metastatic lung seeding in the pre-metastatic lung parenchyma. In
particular, I will investigate potential changes in OBEF-driven vSMC-derived ECM fibronectin and collagen 1a1
and their connection to enhanced lung metastatic seeding (Aim 1). Then, I will identify the responsible secreted
factors (Aim 2) that drive the subsequent vSMC ECM fibronectin and collagen 1a1 production in the lung PMM.
Together, these studies will connect our knowledge of PMM development back to a major suppressor of primary
tumor metastasis, indicating the first targetable tumor biomarker linked to the stromal component of PMM
generation."

While chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) gene therapy was initially tried and abandoned for HIV about 15 years ago, it has recently shown increasing usage and promise for treating cancer. This project revisits this approach for HIV, addressing the key barriers that prevented its success against HIV in the past, including harnessing hematopoietic stem precursor cells (HSPCs) to generate functional and durable CAR T cells in vivo, and generating novel CARs based on broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) and CAR combinations to prevent viral escape. Our specific aims are:
1. To optimize engraftment of bNAb CAR-transduced HSPCs. CAR T cells would develop entirely in vivo starting from HSPCs, avoiding the caveats of ex vivo T cell expansion and transduction to provide a lifelong self-renewing source. Engraftment will be tested and optimized in a humanized mouse model that recapitulates T cell development (CD34-mice, which are immunodeficient mice reconstituted with blood stem cells from adult human donors).
2. To generate bi-specific combined bNAb CARs to reduce options for HIV-1 escape. Novel CARs will be designed using new bi-specific antibody technologies, creating bi-specific CARs.
3. To select CAR combinations with the best antiviral breadth in vivo. Dual combinations of bi-specific CARs will be challenged in vivo in the CD34- mouse model with artificially diverse HIV-1 quasispecies to determine combinations with effective containment, analogous to combination antiretroviral therapy.
These studies will lay the groundwork for successful new approaches to treating HIV infection with CAR gene therapy, which will be a valuable component in future cure strategies."

The development of chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapies (CARTx) for B cell malignancies is a major
milestone in cancer immunotherapy with high rates of durable complete remissions. Although cytokine release
syndrome and neurotoxicity are the earliest and most dramatic immune related adverse events (irAEs) after
CARTx, severe manifestations are transient and only affect a minority of patients. In contrast, on-target, off-
tumor depletion of non-malignant B lineage cells affects the majority of patients and all long-term responders.
CD19 expression declines as B cells differentiate into plasma cells, whereas BCMA is selectively expressed by
plasma cells. Since plasma cells are responsible for maintaining long-lived antibodies and naïve/memory B cells
are important for generating new immunity, CD19 versus BCMA-CARTx may differentially affect preexisting
immunity and vaccine responses. Dr. Hill’s goal is to understand the long-term effects of CARTx on humoral
immunity. This proposal incorporates the expertise of an outstanding group of researchers in infectious diseases,
immuno-oncology, epidemiology, laboratory medicine, and statistics who are dedicated to ensuring the success
of this innovative research proposal. They will leverage their expertise and high-volume immunotherapy
programs to achieve the following aims.
The first Aim involves a prospective observational cohort study of 130 CARTx recipients (50 adult CD19, 50
pediatric CD19, 30 adult BCMA) with relapse-free survival ≥6 months. Dr. Hill will use a novel systematic viral
epitope scanning method (VirScan) to longitudinally characterize the antivirome to 206 viral pathogens. These
results will describe, and identify correlates of, antivirome diversity metrics at 6- and 12-months post-CARTx.
VirScan will allow for a nuanced assessment of the differential impacts of CARTx on humoral immune
competence. The second Aim will utilize samples from Aim 1 to determine the effect of CARTx on the durability
of preexisting humoral immunity to vaccine-preventable infections and the proportion of patients lacking
seroprotection after CARTx. These data will expand on Aim 1 to inform vaccination strategies. In the third Aim,
Dr. Hill will perform a prospective observational study of 95 CARTx recipients (50 adult CD19, 25 pediatric CD19,
and 20 adult BCMA) to define the frequency and correlates of positive vaccine responses ≥6 months after
CARTx. Patients will be vaccinated for S. pneumoniae, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, H. influenza b, and
hepatitis A and B according to institutional guidelines.
This proposal will address critical knowledge gaps by employing innovative methods to elucidate the scope of
pathogen-specific deficits in humoral immunity, and whether vaccination can mitigate these irAEs, after CARTx.
The findings will guide evidence-based strategies for infection prevention, such as vaccination or immunoglobulin
replacement, to improve outcomes in this rapidly growing population of high-risk individuals."

Infrared (IR) spectroscopic imaging directly measures the chemical composition of cells and tissues for each
pixel in the image. Using machine learning, this chemical data can be converted to pathology knowledge, without
the use of dyes or stains – providing a potentially new avenue for clinical diagnoses and research to broadly aid
public health. Since machine learning is integral to the approach, cognition of disease features can make
diagnoses faster, cheaper and more precise. Interestingly, the approach can measure the tumor’s molecular
characteristics and the microenvironment together in one shot. These capabilities can extend state of the art
pathology practice by providing multiplexed stain-free molecular data and predictive models involving spatial and
chemical information from multiple cell types. However, there are significant challenges and engineering
development needed before this vision can be realized, including: (a) an imaging system that is competitive in
measurement time with current clinical practice, (b) accurate and assured results that extend our ability beyond
routine pathology, and (c) demonstration of robust use by pathologists and non-experts in technology. In the last
project period(reported in 25 peer-reviewed publications, 2 granted patents), we developed “high-definition” (HD)
IR imaging, which is now the standard commercial configuration for IR imaging manufacturers. We also
developed the concept of “stainless staining” in which “low-definition” IR images appear to look like low-resolution
stained images. We also demonstrated highly accurate breast tissue classification for a small number of
pathologies. In this project period, we propose an advanced IR imaging system (newly designed optics,
scanning) to make the technology powerful enough to provide a sample-to-image time of ~10 min for large
surgical resections. This allows HD imaging in real time and will allow images, such as from stainless stains, be
near the quality of those used by clinicians and researchers. Technological innovations lie in a design that is the
first novel re-design of IR imaging in over 40 years and performance that is higher in speed, accuracy and image
quality than ever before. Another critical part of our approach is to develop appropriate computational pipelinesfor
extant problems in breast pathology. In addition to traditional models, we will validate the emerging tools of deep
learning when appropriate. Finally, these technological realizations are followed by validation for a set of
important problems in breast cancer care and research. The solutions will be rigorously evaluated against
pathologist diagnoses, using high-quality, annotated data from 400 patients’ surgical resections and multiple
tissue microarrays. Consequently, protocols for a number of identified pain points in breast pathology will result
in addition to the technological progress, making the approach ready for use."

The overarching goal of the proposed RTI International–Cornell Research Coordinating Center (RCC) is to
provide seamless operational support and multidisciplinary experience for building consensus in the Nutrition
for Precision Health Consortium (NPHC). In the 1-year planning phase, we will prioritize efficiency and
objectivity in facilitating the design of diet modules (1: usual dietary assessment; 2: controlled feeding dietary
intervention; and 3: domiciled dietary intervention) nested in All of Us and their research protocols. In the 4-
year implementation phase, we will facilitate the implementation of Modules 1–3, enable the flow of quality
data and specimens across the NPHC, and integrate curated, Artificial intelligence (AI)–ready data into the
All of Us Researcher Workbench, using our established data coordination processes and systems.
Innovations in our approach include tools for conducting dietary studies in hard-to-reach populations,
idiographic (or subject-as-own-control) clinical trials, and wearables research tools and analytics.
Specifically, the proposed RCC will excel in administrating and coordinating NPHC and its research
initiatives, clinical interventions, and data and biospecimen sharing, as follows:
 Aim 1: Optimize the scientific rigor of Modules 1–3
 Aim 2: Ensure NPHC study data are FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable)
 Aim 3: Enable seamless data collection, curation, and transfer including to the Researcher Workbench
 Aim 4: Minimize time to launch of Modules 1–3
 Aim 5: Maximize the efficiency of consortium communications and collaborations
NPHC is being launched to address major research gaps in nutrition; the nature of these gaps and the
complexity of the NPHC activities cannot be underscored enough. RCC will be led by Multiple Principal
Investigators with complementary expertise in coordinating center and multisite leadership and biostatistics
(Dr. Gantz at RTI) and nutritional intervention and clinical expertise (Dr. Mehta at Cornell University) with the
support of a strong and diverse team, organized around cores for Design and Analytics, Data Curation and
Systems, and Study Implementation. Other key components include single IRB and medical safety
monitoring. The RCC will also benefit from our collective institutional strengths, with an expert pool of wide-
ranging research and clinical backgrounds pertinent to the NPHC (e.g., omics, bioinformatics, AI, clinical trial
intervention, nutritional assessment). The proposed RCC is immediately and amply prepared to support to
NPHC in its mission to develop clinically meaningful algorithms that predict individual responses to food and
dietary patterns and to improve health across diverse U.S. populations."
10748311,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) are the second leading cause of cancer death in the
United States, with a survival rate of 3% once it spreads to distant organs. PDAC cells within a tumor are
frequently starved for oxygen due to their high proliferation rate and insufficient vasculature. This degree of
hypoxia in the tumor triggers strong metabolic adaptations on cancer cells that allow their survival and
proliferation. Among these adaptations are altered uptake and utilization of major nutrients, such as glutamine.
However, the precise mechanisms through which pancreas cancer metabolism adapts to hypoxia, and whether
this could be exploited for therapy, remain unknown.
 In preliminary studies, we found that, when pancreatic and lung cancers are exposed to low levels of
oxygen, the amino acid aspartate, required for protein and nucleotide synthesis, becomes limiting. Simply
increasing the uptake of exogenous aspartate by expression of a plasma membrane aspartate transporter
strongly promoted the growth rate of cancer cells under hypoxia and in tumors, as well as enhanced their
metastatic potential. These findings provide evidence that aspartate can be a cancer growth-limiting metabolite
in vivo. Furthermore, a CRISPR/Cas9 screen using a library of sgRNAs targeting rate-limiting metabolic
enzymes revealed that GOT2, one of the two enzymes that de novo synthesizes cellular aspartate from
glutamine, is essential for in vitro proliferation under hypoxia of a KRAS/TP53 mutant PDAC cell line. Building
upon these results, I propose to test the hypothesis that targeting de novo aspartate synthesis may have
therapeutic potential in pancreatic tumors at the level of primary tumor growth and metastasis.
 Throughout the initial phase of this award, we will define the essentiality of GOT2-mediated aspartate
synthesis in a panel of PDAC cell lines upon being exposed to low tensions of oxygen and, importantly, when
grown as tumors and during colonization of distant organs. Additionally, we will determine the contribution and
impact on cancer proliferation of the two divergent metabolic routes of glutamine conversion into aspartate:
oxidative and reductive metabolism. Building upon the obtained results, we will target aspartate synthesis in
pre-clinical patient-derived models and KRAS/TP53 mutant mouse models and, by using isotope-labeling
metabolomic analysis, we will show which aspartate synthesis route is used by pancreatic tumors in vivo.
 Finally, by using in vivo metabolomics and mitochondrial pull-downs in primary and metastatic tumors, I
propose to define whether hypoxia-triggered metabolic rewiring is a determinant of the metastatic potential of
PDAC cells. These analysis will identify which metabolic changes PDAC cells undergo during metastasis,
unveiling potential liabilities that could be targeted in order to decrease spread of PDAC to distant organs.
 Altogether, the proposed experiments will define the role of aspartate synthesis in PDAC tumor growth
and metastasis, and will test whether any other metabolic changes are required for PDAC cells to metastasize."

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) currently affects 1 in 59 children in the United States, 80% of whom are male,
and is characterized primarily by impaired social interaction/communication. Prenatal exposure to air pollution
has been implicated in the etiology of ASD, as well as many other neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the
mechanisms by which air pollution alters the development of social circuits in the brain remains unknown.
Importantly, there are large social disparities in environmental toxin exposure whereby marginalized communities
bear the greatest burden of exposure. Using a novel mouse model that combines an environmental toxin (diesel
exhaust particles; DEP) with an ethologically relevant maternal stressor (resource deprivation; MS), our
preliminary data show that these exposures in combination, but neither alone, induce robust deficits in social
interaction in male, but not female offspring. This is line with a model in which maternal psychosocial stress
unmasks vulnerability to environmental toxins in offspring. ASD is increasingly recognized as a whole-body
disorder. Gastrointestinal symptoms and changes in the composition of the gut microbiome are present in more
than 50% of individuals with ASD. Studies using animal models suggest a causal link between the gut
microbiome and social behavior, but this has not been studied in the context of environmental toxins. During the
K99 phase of this proposal, in Aim 1, I propose to further my training in the analysis of the gut microbiome to
ask whether cross-fostering of DEP/MS pups at birth can prevent shifts in the gut microbiome (assessed using
metagenomic sequencing). The dopamine system supports social interaction, is sensitive to microbial signaling,
and my preliminary data suggests is down-regulated following DEP/MS exposure. Thus, in Aim 2, I propose to
learn in vivo optogenetic techniques to test whether activation of the mesolimbic dopamine reward pathway is
sufficient to restore social behavior following DEP/MS. During the R00 phase, in Aim 3, I will use the techniques
acquired during the K99 phase to determine whether changes in the gut microbiome are responsible for changes
in social behavior and dopamine signaling in DEP/MS offspring. Moreover, I will use the preliminary data
gathered in Aim 1 to ask what potential metabolites or molecular mechanisms might be altered following
DEP/MS. Finally, I will ask whether microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, play a key role in mediating
these microbiome-driven changes. Together, these experiments will elucidate the ways in which pollutants and
stress synergize to produce dysregulation of the gut-brain axis and deficits in social behavior.
 This proposal will significantly advance my career development by providing me with new training in
cutting-edge techniques such as in vivo optogenetics and metagenomic sequencing. Thus, it will help me to
establish my own independent line of work and the preliminary data obtained herein will serve as a foundation
for future R01 funding."

Ischemic preconditioning is a well-established phenomenon, in which a brief episode(s) of controlled ischemia
and reperfusion renders cardioprotection from a subsequent sustained episode of ischemia. An emerging body
of evidence demonstrated that neural regulated heart rate modulation confers cardiac preconditioning
responses. Understanding the mechanism through model systems of preconditioning would help us identify the
genes and proteins when designing future drug targets for the prevention of ischemic cardiac injury. As a
promising alternative to electrical pacing to modulate heart rate, optogenetic pacing does not require physical
contact, has high spatial and temporal precision, offers more specific excitation, and avoids artifacts from
electrical stimulation. Recent developments in the field of optogenetics make it possible for non-invasive and
specific optical control of the heart rhythm in animal models, such as in Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila is
a powerful genetic model system that has been used since the early 1900s to characterize genes associated
with human diseases, including cardiac diseases. Studies performed in flies can provide insights into conserved
mechanisms in cardiac diseases, which can be applied to higher organisms, including humans. Working in
collaboration with Drs. Airong Li and Rudolph Tanzi from the Massachusetts General Hospital, we demonstrated
non-invasive optogenetic pacing and concurrent optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of the Drosophila
heart for the first time. Recently, we further demonstrated red-light optogenetic pacing and successful optical
control of tachycardia, bradycardia, and restorable cardiac arrest in fly models. Building on the decade-long
productive collaboration with Drs. Li and Tanzi and new collaborations with Dr. Abhinav Diwan (cardiologist)
and Dr. Jeanne Nerbonne (cardiac electrophysiologist) and Dr. Kenneth Schechtman (biostatistician) at
Washington University, we propose to develop a high-throughput integrated OCT imaging and dual-color
optogenetic pacing system and establish a novel research platform to study preconditioning and hypoxia
responsiveness in the fly heart. We hypothesize that periods of bradypacing will precondition the fly heart to
protect against hypoxia, via activation of the autophagy-lysosome pathway. The specific aims are: 1) Develop
and optimize a high-throughput integrated instrument for non-invasive OCT imaging and optogenetic control of
fly heart function in vivo; 2) Develop double transgenic fly models and functional assays based on OCT imaging
to characterize fly heart physiology in vivo; 3) Define functional and molecular changes in response to hypoxia
and optogenetic preconditioning in transgenic fly models. If successful, the high-throughput optical imaging and
dual-color optogenetic pacing platform developed in this program combined with powerful double transgenic fly
models will enable us to characterize changes of the fly heart function in response to different stress challenges
that is not feasible before. This will allow us to perform a series of new experiments, providing insights into
conserved molecular mechanisms on hypoxia-induced cardiac changes and preconditioning."
10753511,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A fundamental but poorly understood process in eukaryotic cells is how cells structure their genomes into
distinct functional domains. This project addresses this gap in knowledge by studying the centromere, a
specific chromatin domain found in all eukaryotes. This stably propagated locus guides the assembly of
kinetochores to ensure proper segregation of chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis. Mis-regulation of
centromeres adversely affects chromosome segregation resulting in aneuploidy, a condition found in more
than 90% of all cancers. Aneuploidy contributes to the development of many diseases, such as cancer and
Down syndrome. The goal of this project is to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the
specification and inheritance of centromeres. In most eukaryotes, centromeres are epigenetically governed by
the centromere-specific histone H3 variant, CENP-A. CENP-A partially replaces canonical histone H3 at
centromeres, and provides the foundation for the assembly of kinetochores. Centromeres are usually
embedded in epigenetically distinct heterochromatin, the transcriptionally silenced chromatin domain.
Assembly of CENP-A at centromeres is cell cycle-regulated. Parental CENP-A is partitioned equally among
daughter centromeres following DNA replication, whereas loading of newly synthesized CENP-A to
centromeres is uncoupled from DNA replication. How CENP-A chromatin at centromeres is assembled
throughout the cell cycle remains poorly understood. Mislocalization of CENP-A to non-centromeric regions
has a devastating impact on chromosome segregation, and has been linked to a variety of cancers. Ubiquitin-
mediated proteolysis of CENP-A is a conserved mechanism to prevent CENP-A mislocalization. But how non-
centromeric regions are protected from CENP-A mis-incorporation in normal cells is largely unexplored. In
addition, CENP-A in centromeres is interspersed with the canonical histone H3. The histone H3 within
centromeres is actually vital for proper assembly of CENP-A chromatin. How CENP-A and H3 levels are
properly balanced in centromeres is unknown. We propose to use fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe)
to address these outstanding questions. Fission yeast is a simple eukaryotic model organism with many
aspects of centromere regulation conserved with humans. It is particularly suited to an interdisciplinary
approach that includes genetics, genomics, cytology, biochemistry, and structural biology. We propose to: 1)
define the mechanisms underlying cell cycle-dependent CENP-A assembly at centromeres, 2) determine how
formation of ectopic CENP-A chromatin is prevented, 3) identify regulatory mechanism for how CENP-A and
histone H3 levels are balanced at centromeres. Our study also provides important new insights into the role of
heterochromatin in centromere function. Given that epigenetic regulation in fission yeast is conserved, our
studies will shed light on the processes governing chromosome segregation in human cells, and contribute to a
better understanding of human diseases resulting from centromere misregulation."
10753513,"The cranial base growth center synchondroses are essential for regulating bidirectional postnatal craniofacial
growth and skeletal patterning of the midface by forming the structural foundation for the upper nasal airway and
masticatory complex. Similar to the long bone growth plate, chondrocytes in the synchondroses are organized
into resting, proliferating and hypertrophic zones that ossify during skeletal maturation. Importantly, organization
and activation of proliferating chondrocytes is required to promote cranial base growth. Fibroblast growth factor
receptor 3 (Fgfr3) is expressed in chondrocytes in the synchondroses and Fgfr3 gain-of-function mutations cause
achondroplasia associated with premature fusion of the synchondroses and midfacial hypoplasia in humans and
mice. Current treatments for midfacial hypoplasia are limited to craniofacial and orthognathic reconstructive
surgeries in patients. Despite these clinically meaningful findings, it is unknown how Fgfr3+ chondrocytes behave
throughout postnatal synchondrosis growth. Therefore, the overall goal of this proposal is to identify mechanisms
by which Fgfr3+ proliferating chondrocytes orchestrate postnatal synchondrosis growth and maturation. My
preliminary data suggests that conditional deletion of the causative gene for cleidocranial dysplasia, runt-related
transcription factor 2 (Runx2), in Fgfr3+ chondrocytes in mice causes premature fusion of the synchondroses,
accelerated chondrocyte hypertrophy and decreased osteoblast formation. Although Runx2’s role as a central
regulator of osteoblast differentiation and skeletal formation has been established in long bones, its function in
synchondrosis development remains unknown. By combining our current knowledge of Fgfr3-related cranial
base malformations with my extensive preliminary data, I hypothesize that Fgfr3-expressing chondrocytes
maintain the bidirectional orientation and growth potential of the postnatal cranial base synchondroses
through a mechanism dependent on Runx2 activation.
 Two aims are proposed to address the central hypothesis. 1. Assess the clonal dynamics and cellular
heterogeneity of Fgfr3+ chondrocytes in the synchondroses. 2. Define the role of Runx2 on Fgfr3+ chondrocyte
organization in the synchondroses. This project seeks to provide novel mechanistic insight into postnatal
synchondrosis growth and maturation, thereby advancing the current scientific state of cranial base biology.
Furthermore, these investigations aim to unravel an innovative mechanism placing Runx2 as a central regulator
of postnatal synchondrosis development. Notably, this project intends to catalyze future studies into
therapeutically targetable Fgfr3-related pathways mutated in patients with malformed synchondroses."

Some cell signaling systems operate by a mechanism of promiscuous signaling, where multiple ligands can bind to a single receptor before starting a downstream cascade of signaling that results in gene expression. Promiscuous signaling systems present in cells are prevalent in many different types of biological processes from development and maintenance, to disease, including cancer. The bone morphogenetic pathway (BMP) is an ideal promiscuous signaling pathway to study because, of the 10 distinct BMP ligands that act as growth factors, each competitively binds with a type I or type II receptor of the pathway. Recent work created mathematical models of the promiscuous interactions within the BMP pathway that were able to replicate experimental observations of BMP pathway signaling by dosing a BMP-responsive cell line, which expressed YFP when the BMP gene expression was activated, to a 6-fold BMP ligand titration series. However, previous results relied on matrix combination screening of BMP pathway to examine responses and fit a small subset of the parameters of the mathematical models replicating experimental results. Continuing to screen combinations of ligands results in this manner results in an exponential increase in the number of ligand screens required. Better computational tools are needed to screen the BMP pathway to better understand promiscuous signaling phenomena. This project aims to develop machine learning tools to quantify our uncertainty of cell signaling systems such as the BMP pathway and reduce the number of experiments required to understand cell systems. To do this, machine learning methods will be developed to optimize screening of ligands to reduce the time to determine parameter of the BMP mathematical model, as well as help in selecting the correct model that characterizes experimental results. The resulting computational tools will demonstrate how to optimally collect experimental data in biological systems while quantifying uncertainty of underlying biological models. These methods can be more broadly translated to systems biology models outside of the BMP pathway."
10753515,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) refers to a collection of heterogeneous breast tumors that lack expression
of immediately druggable molecules, such as the estrogen and progesterone receptors and human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2. No targeted therapy is currently approved for the vast majority of TNBC patients. TNBC
patients who have received the current standard of care, consisting of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery,
often experience early tumor recurrence and a significantly worse mortality rate. Therefore, it is critical to identify
and validate clinically viable, life-saving targeted therapies for patients with TNBC. We previously reported that
the oncogenic MYC pathways were activated in ~50% of TNBC cases compared with non-TNBC cases and that
MYC levels were associated with poor outcomes among TNBC patients. Unfortunately, clinical development of
inhibitors that directly target MYC activity has remained challenging. To overcome this challenge, we previously
took an alternative approach known as the synthetic lethal screening approach to identify readily druggable
targets required for MYC-driven tumor viability but that are not essential in non-tumor cells. Our screen identified
the PIM family of kinases, which is composed of the closely related nonessential kinase isoforms PIM1, -2, and
-3 (PIM hereafter), as a promising target in MYC-driven TNBC. We found that PIM expression was elevated in
triple-negative (TN) tumors in clinical samples and was associated with poor patient outcomes. Clinically relevant
pan-PIM inhibitors showed activity in various experimental models of TNBC. However, our single-agent efficacy
studies using preclinical PIM inhibitors showed that although PIM inhibition significantly slowed the growth of TN
tumors, it induced only modest in vivo tumor cell death and regression, suggesting the need for combination
therapies. We have taken robust drug screening approaches and have unexpectedly found that the drug
combination that targets PIM kinases and the proteasome can acutely induce toxic levels of proteotoxic stress
selectively in MYC-overexpressing TNBC cells. Mechanistically, our preliminary observations indicate that PIM
inhibition, which elevates the levels of reactive oxygen species, when combined with proteasome inhibition,
overwhelms the capacity of TNBC cells to continuously degrade damaged proteins, resulting in proteotoxic crisis.
Thus, our observations raise the possibility—and our study will test the hypothesis—that PIM inhibition
represents a unique and clinically viable tool to sensitize TNBC tumors to proteasome inhibition. The successful
execution of this research will allow for the identification and interrogation of clinically exploitable vulnerabilities
in MYC-driven solid-cancer types such as TNBC. The outcomes of this research could also encourage the FDA-
approved proteasome inhibitors (e.g., carfilzomib), which have not been successfully used outside of liquid tumor
types, to be rapidly evaluated in combination with pan-PIM kinase inhibitors in early-stage MYC-driven solid-
tumor trials."

 The ability of the brain to utilize information from past experiences to guide future decisions, termed adaptive
behavior, is critical for survival. To effectively adapt behaviors, the brain applies stored memory to new but similar
situations (generalization), while also maintaining the capacity to distinguish unique stimuli (discrimination).
When these critical processes (memory generalization or discrimination) go awry, it can lead to maladaptive
disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and panic disorder. Despite their importance,
mechanisms underlying memory discrimination and generalization remain largely unknown. This proposal will
investigate the dynamic processes that underlie the utilization of an encoded memory to guide future behaviors,
in particular the molecular, synaptic, and circuit mechanisms that govern the balance between discrimination
and generalization. We have collected very exciting preliminary data showing that individual contextual fear
memories are represented in the dentate gyrus (DG) by multiple functionally distinct neuronal ensembles defined
by different activity-dependent transcriptional pathways, and that these ensembles bi-directionally regulate the
discrimination-generalization balance. Based on these exciting findings, we hypothesize that the activity-
dependent pathways target specific synaptic inputs on DG granule cells to differentially control memory
discrimination and generalization. We aim to (1) uncover novel forms of learning-induced synaptic plasticity; (2)
reveal underlying circuit mechanisms for memory discrimination and generalization; and (3) identify the
molecular players important for this experience-dependent behavioral adaptation. The proposed research is both
conceptually and technically innovative. It will experimentally demonstrate for the first time functionally distinct
active neuronal ensembles coexisting within the memory engram, shed light on the synaptic and circuit
mechanisms by which encoded memories directly drive experience-dependent behavioral outputs, and may lead
to new treatment strategies for neuropsychiatric disorders, such as PTSD and panic disorder, which are caused
by the imbalance between memory discrimination and generalization."

behavior, is critical for survival. To effectively adapt behaviors, the brain applies stored memory to new but similar
situations (generalization), while also maintaining the capacity to distinguish unique stimuli (discrimination).
When these critical processes (memory generalization or discrimination) go awry, it can lead to maladaptive
disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and panic disorder. Despite their importance,
mechanisms underlying memory discrimination and generalization remain largely unknown. This proposal will
investigate the dynamic processes that underlie the utilization of an encoded memory to guide future behaviors,
in particular the molecular, synaptic, and circuit mechanisms that govern the balance between discrimination
and generalization. We have collected very exciting preliminary data showing that individual contextual fear
memories are represented in the dentate gyrus (DG) by multiple functionally distinct neuronal ensembles defined
by different activity-dependent transcriptional pathways, and that these ensembles bi-directionally regulate the
discrimination-generalization balance. Based on these exciting findings, we hypothesize that the activity-
dependent pathways target specific synaptic inputs on DG granule cells to differentially control memory
discrimination and generalization. We aim to (1) uncover novel forms of learning-induced synaptic plasticity; (2)
reveal underlying circuit mechanisms for memory discrimination and generalization; and (3) identify the
molecular players important for this experience-dependent behavioral adaptation. The proposed research is both
conceptually and technically innovative. It will experimentally demonstrate for the first time functionally distinct
active neuronal ensembles coexisting within the memory engram, shed light on the synaptic and circuit
mechanisms by which encoded memories directly drive experience-dependent behavioral outputs, and may lead
to new treatment strategies for neuropsychiatric disorders, such as PTSD and panic disorder, which are caused
by the imbalance between memory discrimination and generalization."
10753537,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs; previously called Recurrent Abdominal
Pain) affect 10-20% of children and adults worldwide exerting a tremendous economic, social, and emotional
burden. Up to 66% of children go on to have similar symptoms as adults. In children, the two most common
FGIDs are functional abdominal pain (FAP) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS - essentially FAP with changes
in stooling pattern). Management and treatment are hampered by lack of biomarkers to characterize and
understand pathophysiologically what are phenotypically and arbitrarily defined conditions. Previous studies
have evaluated IBS, not FAP, and relied primarily on retrospective symptom evaluation and utilized methodology
(e.g., 16S sequencing) that limits in depth interrogation of perturbations (e.g., gut dysbiosis) reported in children
and adults with IBS. Further, `omics (metabolomics, lipidomics, metaproteomics) data is largely missing from
studies of FGIDs and is urgently required - our preliminary data show that it likely provides critical mechanistic
insight into the links between abdominal pain symptoms and the pathobiologic alterations of gut dysbiosis, barrier
dysfunction, and neuroimmune dysfunction which we and others have described in FGIDs. Our preliminary data
support the hypothesis that these alterations can pathobiologically discriminate FGIDs from healthy controls as
well as identify disease mechanisms of pain in FGIDs. We propose to build on our previous work and use
previously collected prospective abdominal pain and stooling diaries and stool samples collected from a large
and well-vetted group of children with FGIDs (IBS n=133, FAP n=47) and healthy controls (HC, n=112). Our
Hypothesis is that microbial community characterization and `omics profiling will provide biomarkers to
differentiate FGIDs (IBS and FAP) from HC and generate insight into the genesis of pain symptoms (and stooling
characteristics in IBS). Our Specific Aims are to use: 1) Global unbiased whole genome shotgun sequencing,
metabolomics, lipidomics and metaproteomics (`omics) on stool samples to differentiate children with FGIDs vs
HC using classifier models; Sub-Aim – explore potential differences between FAP and IBS and HC; and 2)
Proprietary Texas Children's Hospital Microbiome Center reference databases and state-of-the art bioinformatics
approaches (e.g., supervised learning, bipartite, Bayesian models) to identify disorder-specific biomarkers and
therapeutic targets within children with FGIDs: Sub-Aim 2a - Characterize the relationships between `omics and
abdominal pain symptoms (and stooling symptoms in IBS). Sub-Aim 2b – Characterize the relationships
between `omics and abnormal physiology (impaired barrier function, neuroimmune dysfunction). It is anticipated
that this innovative, multidisciplinary study will better inform patient management and offer unique therapeutic
strategies based on novel insights provided by FGID biomarkers. The goals of this application fit with NINR PA-
18-140, the recently published NINR Symptom Science Model, and the NIH Common Fund and Precision
Medicine Initiatives."
10892644,"Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is an acquired disorder causing permanent functional deficits due to lack
of regenerative ability of the central nervous system (CNS). The inability of the CNS to re-generate is in stark
contrast with its ability to generate precise circuitry during development. Corticospinal neurons (CSN) are the
subtype of cortical projection neurons (PN) that normally connect the cerebral cortex to the spinal cord to control
voluntary motor output directly and indirectly. During development, CSN axons traverse vast distances to
establish segmentally-specific functional circuitry along the rostro-caudal spinal cord. Establishment of such
specific circuitry necessitates tightly regulated, dynamic developmental programs to progressively refine CSN
identity and their input and output connections. After injury, CSN do not normally re-establish functional
circuitry. Despite decades of research, and existence of multiple animal models of increased CSN regeneration,
the extent of functional recovery for people with SCI remains largely unchanged. This lack of clinical advance is
partly due to limitations of understanding of molecular mechanisms directly responsible for locally enacting axon
growth and guidance (or not), both during development and during attempted regeneration. In my proposed
work, I will investigate the distinct transcriptomes and proteomes of CSN growth cones (GCs) vs. somata during
development and after injury, toward selecting molecular candidates for functional manipulation.
 GCs are the cellular subcompartments at the ends of growing axons that directly enact neuronal subtype-
specific axon growth and guidance during development and after injury. Direct investigation of CSN GC
molecular machinery promises to elucidate local subcellular processes that underpin developmental and
regenerative CSN growth. My lab has recently developed experimental and analytic approaches to deeply
investigate subtype- and stage-specific GCs in vivo. These approaches have led to identification of neuronal
subtype-specific regulation of local RNA, protein, and translation in interhemispheric callosal and
corticothalamic projection neurons. My lab and I have purified thoracolumbar CSN (CSNTL) GCs and somata
from postnatal day 3 (P3), P5, and P7 mice, during axon elongation, grey matter innervation, and branching. I
will analyze the RNA sequencing data obtained, and will expand by addition of proteomics, to select candidates
for functional investigation (Aim 1). I will use a model of increased CSN regeneration after SCI (Pten deletion)
to investigate local RNA-protein of regenerating CSNTL (Aim 2). Why CNS regeneration does not occur after
injury is a critical unanswered, fundamental question with immense translational implications. My work aims to
elucidate developmental growth programs responsible for directing appropriate CSN axon elongation, segment-
specific branching and collateralization, and synapse targeting. Importantly, my work also aims to elucidate
molecular mechanisms responsible for enabling growth of the CNS after injury. Deeper elucidation of molecular
mechanisms of regenerative growth will enable future development of targeted therapies for disability from SCI."
10755251,"The Tissue Culture Core (Core 1) will be responsible for providing investigators with cultured cells,
monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins, and recombinant adeno-associated viruses. Core 1 will be
directed by Dr. Russell DeBose-Boyd, with the assistance of Dr. Joseph Goldstein (who has directed the
Department of Molecular Genetics Tissue Culture Facility for the past 40 years) and Dr. Guosheng Liang (who
has worked in the Department for 20 years). The technical work in the Core is carried out by five experienced
technicians, one of whom (Lisa Beatty) has been in charge of this facility for more than 30 years. The physical
facilities of the Core consist of four suites of rooms that are used solely for tissue culture. The facility is equipped
with 46 incubators, 17 inverted microscopes, 1 stereo microscope, 16 sterile work areas (hoods), 2 roller bottle
apparatuses, 7 refrigerated incubator shakers, 3 table-top refrigerated centrifuges, 11 refrigerators, and 7 liquid
nitrogen freezers for storage of cell lines.
 The successful completion of this entire Program Project Grant (PPG) depends on the smooth operation
of Core 1. The Core developed considerable experience in maintaining quality control and in growing multiple
cell lines, including over 1100 different primary human fibroblast cell strains, derived from skin biopsies from
normal subjects as well as from patients with metabolic disorders supported by previous PPGs. Tens of
thousands of transfection experiments have been carried out in the Core in which various cell lines (e.g., HEK-
293, CHO, and SV589 cells) have been transfected with multiple plasmid constructs containing either the
protein-coding region or the promoter/enhancer region of multiple genes. From these transfections, more than
3000 stable and permanent cell lines have been clonally established and frozen away in multiple aliquots.
 In addition to maintenance of stock cell lines and preparation of cultured cells for experiments, the Core
is involved in the following activities: 1) Generation and maintenance of mouse and rabbit hybridoma cell lines
and production of monoclonal antibodies from culture medium; 2) Purification by Protein G- and Protein A-
Sepharose chromatography of mouse/rabbit monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against
multiple proteins; 3) Growth of large volumes of suspension-culture cells that allow efficient transfection of
cDNAs and production of their encoded proteins; 4) Isolating, maintaining, and freezing away cloned cell lines
that have been transfected with mutated versions of various cDNA and promoter/enhancer constructs; 5)
Maintenance of mammalian and insect cells in suspension culture for production of recombinant proteins by
infecting these cells with recombinant baculoviruses encoding cloned cDNAs; 6) Maintenance and production
of cells for generation of recombinant adeno-associated viruses, which are used for evaluating the function of
genes in cultured cells and in the liver after in vivo injection; 7) Sending aliquots of monoclonal and polyclonal
antibodies and cell lines to hundreds of investigators who request them."
10755254,"Core 2 – Lipid Mass Spectrometry provides multiple essential services to every investigator involved
with this Program Project Grant. These services include lipid analysis measurements as well as novel and
unique lipid measurements that provide unparalleled and comprehensive data providing insight into lipid
metabolism. The Core is directed by Dr. Jeff McDonald, who has led the lipid mass spectrometry efforts at UT
Southwestern for 17 years.
 Services include mass spectrometry-based quantification of individual lipid species including sterols,
oxysterols, sphingolipids, steroids, bile acids, and fatty acids. Qualitative or semi-quantitative analysis of all lipid
classes can be measured providing relative comparisons between sample groups and fatty acid compositions
for cholesteryl esters, glycerolipids, and other lipid classes.
 Unique lipid mass spectrometry measurements center around use of ultra-high resolution mass
spectrometry to distinctly measure deuterium incorporation into lipids instead of mathematically deconvoluting
2H signals which overlap with the naturally occurring 13C isotope mass envelope. Using this method results in a
signal-to-noise ratio that was at best 1 or 2 using traditional mass spectrometry (unit resolution) techniques to a
signal-to-noise of 1000 or greater. This requires very advanced mass spectrometers, two of which are currently
in our facility. Coupled with advanced chromatography methods that resolve lipids and lipid classes, the
synthesis and flow of lipids through a designated biosynthetic or catabolic pathway in cultured cells and living
animals is now feasible.
 The complex and expensive equipment needed to provide these services include multiple mass
spectrometers, a liquid handling robot for sample preparation, 96-well SPE and nitrogen blow-down manifolds
for sample processing.
 The lipid mass spectrometry measurements provided by Core 2 will play a major role in every specific
aim in this Program Project and in every publication that arises from the completed research."
10755255,"Elevated plasma levels of triglyceride-rich ApoBCLs (ApoB-Containing Lipoproteins) constitute a major
component of the residual risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) in patients who have been treated with statins
and/or PCSK9 inhibitors. To mitigate the ApoBCL risk component, we need a deeper understanding of the
machinery that controls the production of ApoBCLs. This machinery is comprised of two membrane proteins,
Scap and Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Proteins (SREBPs). Scap is a protein embedded in the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane through eight transmembrane helices. Scap forms complexes with
SREBPs, which are also bound to the ER membrane through two transmembrane helices. SREBPs contain
transcription factor domains that control the synthesis of fatty acids, triglycerides, and cholesterol, which form
the lipid component of ApoBCLs. Activation of SREBPs requires their transport by Scap to the Golgi where two
proteases release their transcription factor domain that can now enter the nucleus for target gene activation.
When cholesterol in the ER rises and binds to Scap, it traps SREBPs in the ER, thus preventing proteolytic
cleavage and nuclear entry. A major hurdle in understanding Scap’s switch-like molecular mechanism and how
it controls SREBPs and ApoBCL production is the lack of a soluble cholesterol-mimetic compound that
specifically binds and inhibits Scap.
 This proposal is based on a recent breakthrough in our laboratory involving the development of a novel high-
throughput and rapid screening protocol, which has identified the first small molecule that binds specifically to
Scap’s cholesterol-binding site and blocks activation of SREBPs. Scap contains two large loops (Loop1 and
Loop7) that extend into the lumen of the ER bind each other when cholesterol in the ER is low. When ER
cholesterol rises, it binds to Loop1, causing Loop1 to dissociate from Loop7, trapping the Scap/SREBP complex
in the ER and blocking the transcriptional activation of all SREBP target genes. In Aim 1, we outline studies to
improve the potency of our recently discovered cholesterol-mimetic Scap inhibitor and will use these inhibitors
to understand how Loop1 dissociates from Loop7. The inhibitors will also be used as stabilizing agents to enable
structural determination of Scap, which will elucidate the cholesterol binding mechanism at an atomic level. In
Aim 2, we outline our approach to optimizing the in vivo pharmacokinetic properties of our various Scap
inhibitors, after which we will explore their effects in inhibiting Scap and SREBP target genes in livers of mice
under different metabolic conditions. Our previous studies involving genetically altered mice revealed that
inhibition of Scap in the liver blocks SREBPs and markedly reduces synthesis of fatty acids, triglycerides, and
cholesterol, dramatically lowering ApoBCL production in these models and also in wild-type mice fed a high fat
diet and in hamsters fed a high carbohydrate diet. If these proof-of-concept studies are successful, our inhibitors
might lead companies to develop new drugs to reduce plasma ApoBCLs and prevent coronary heart disease."
10755259,"Project 2. Role of Multi-Enzyme Complexes in ApoBCL Secretion
SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Although statins and PCSK9 inhibitors decrease LDL-Cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and reduce cardiovascular
events, significant residual risk of CHD remains even in maximally treated individuals with low plasma levels of
LDL-C. Multiple lines of evidence support the contention that elevated plasma levels of triglyceride (TG)-rich
ApoB-Containing Lipoproteins (ApoBCLs) contribute significantly to this residual risk. Previously, we have
shown that the transcription factor, SREBP-1c, leads to activation of all genes encoding the enzymes involved
in FA synthesis. Excessive activation of SREBP-1c in liver results in high levels of FA and TG synthesis, VLDL
secretion, and ultimately hypertriglyceridemia. The studies in this project will characterize a new post-
translational regulatory mechanism that modulates FA and TG synthesis as well as VLDL production.
 The three enzymes that synthesize palmitate (C16:0) — ATP-citrate lyase (ACL), acetyl-CoA carboxylase
(ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) — reside in the cytoplasm. The two enzymes that elongate and/or
desaturate palmitate, ELOVL6 and SCD1, are located in the ER, and the first enzyme in the synthesis of
glycerolipids, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 1 (GPAM), is located in the mitochondrial membrane. The
distinct subcellular locations of these enzymes produce a unique spatial challenge for the efficient synthesis of
FAs and TGs since the product of one enzyme is the substrate for the next.
 Our preliminary data suggest that the cytosolic FA synthesis enzymes form a complex. This discovery
stemmed from the characterization of a SREBP-1c-regulated gene designated MIG12. We found that MIG12
bound directly to ACCs, facilitated ACC polymerization, and increased overall rates of FA synthesis in liver.
MIG12 is structurally similar to another small protein designated S14. Our subsequent studies have shown that
S14 co-immunoprecipitated MIG12, ACC, and FAS suggesting that these proteins form a complex in the cytosol.
 Here, we will identify and characterize all proteins in the FA synthesis complex and determine how these
proteins associate with each other and with the ER and/or mitochondria. Next, we will determine whether the
formation and disassociation of the FA synthesis complex is regulated by hormonal signals in vitro and in vivo.
Finally, we will characterize the physiological function of lipogenic complex in vivo through a series of studies in
mice that lack the key proteins required for the formation of the FA synthesis complex. Combined, these studies
will provide important new insights into how the cytosolic lipogenic complex ultimately provides FAs to the ER
for further elongation and/or desaturation as well as to GPAM for TG synthesis and VLDL secretion."
10755262,"PROJECT 3: Post-translational Control of Triglyceride and Cholesterol Metabolism by ANGPTL3 &
ANGPTL8 in ApoBCL Clearance
PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this grant is to elucidate the molecular basis of the lipid-lowering effects of inactivating ANGPTL3
(A3) and ANGPTL8 (A8). Previously we discovered that inactivating mutations in A3 in humans are associated
with reduced circulating levels of triglycerides (TGs). We showed that A3 forms a complex with a related protein,
A8, to inactivate lipoprotein lipase (LPL), an intravascular enzyme in peripheral tissues that hydrolyzes circulating
TG. Inactivation of either A3 or A8 reduced plasma TG levels by increasing LPL activity. Despite these advances
in our understanding, fundamental questions remain about how A3 and A8 interact to inhibit LPL in vivo.
Moreover, A3 has activities that are independent of A8. Inactivation of A3 dramatically lowers plasma cholesterol,
as well as TG levels. This activity does not require A8 or any of the known hepatic lipoprotein clearance
pathways. Our group, and that of Dan Rader’s, has shown that endothelial lipase (EL) is needed for the
cholesterol-lowering effects of A3 inactivation. The scientific premise of this application is that elucidating the
molecular mechanisms underlying the lipid-lowering effects of A3 and A8 inhibition will lead to new strategies for
the prevention and treatment of cardiometabolic disorders.
 In AIM 1 we will determine the forms of A3/A8 and A3 that are operative in vivo in inhibiting LPL and EL,
respectively. Both proteins are subject to post-translational modifications, including proteolytic cleavage and
oligomerization. We will define the basic properties of the active forms of the native proteins with respect to
cleavage (Aim 1A) and stoichiometry (Aim 1A), before purifying the active complexes and determining their high
resolution structures (Aim 1C). In AIM 2 we will characterize molecularly the noncanonical pathway for hepatic
clearance of ApoB-containing lipoproteins (ApoBL) in A3 deficiency and test 3 hypotheses regarding the
molecular basis for this pathway: First, that EL-stimulated ApoBL uptake is a receptor-mediated endocytic
process (Aim 2A); Second, that EL alters the composition of nascent VLDL, exposing a new ligand for ApoBL
uptake by the liver (Aim 2B). Finally, we will establish an unbiased genetic screen in cultured hepatocytes to
identify the receptor that mediates ApoBL uptake by liver and validate receptor activity in vivo (Aim 2C).
Elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which A3 and A8 alter lipid metabolism will provide new insights into
key metabolic pathways. They will also provide a mechanistic basis for a new generation of lipid-lowering agents.
These goals complement the aims of Research Project 1 and Project 2 to understand what regulates the
formation, location, and metabolic fate of lipids so as to develop new agents for the treatment of cardiometabolic
disorders."

training program for skills development, research mentorship, and participation in practice-
oriented clinical research. The partnership addresses NIDCR’s opportunity for Practice-Based
Research Integrating Multidisciplinary Experiences in Dental Schools (PRIMED). There is a
need in dental education to promote research skill training and experiences, at both the pre- and
post-doctoral levels, and to integrate these processes with interprofessional education and
transdisciplinary research. This proposal is designed to foster culture change to embrace
research as a critical component of both dental education and dental practice.
 The proposed project outlines the Development of Opportunities for Research
(DOOR): Future Academic Interdisciplinary Workforce and Collaborators for the National
Dental Practice-Based Research Network (PBRN). Along with clinical research skills
development and mentoring, included are two clinical research studies with common databases
across the two schools, to involve dental students, residents, clinical faculty, and research-
intensive faculty. The studies will be focused on diabetes detection chairside (Advancing Pre-
diabetes/Periodontal Research in Oral Academic Clinical Healthcare; APPROACH) or pain
conditions affecting dental treatment (Chronic Overlapping Pain Evaluation Study; COPES).
 This project will leverage the resources of UF as a research-intensive dental school (#5 in
NIDCR funding) to promote a pipeline of dental students and residents at both UF and ECU
who are engaged with clinical research. As a newer dental school, ECU (#47 in NIDCR funding)

given their successes in realizing racial and ethnic diversity among their dental students and the
patients whom they serve. For both institutions, the resources of the UF Clinical and
Translational Science Institute will be harnessed for research training and implementation,
also relying on UF’s experience with the Dental Practice Based Research Network.
Additionally, the Dental Clinical Research Unit at UF will be used as a resource, as will the

10746105,"The immune system recognizes aberrant cells and eliminates them prior to emergence of nascent tumors. This
prevents progression of many malignancies. In the absence of such immunity in mice or humans, multiple and
frequent tumors are generated. Current immunosurveillance model involves the priming of T cell and NK cell
immunity. The gap in knowledge in this model is raised in two questions; (1) What is the molecular mechanism
for cross-priming T cell responses in the context of the negligible amount of antigen available at the early
stages of nascent tumor development? (2) What is the stimuli for co-stimulation of T cell priming and activation
of NK cells. Our work has demonstrated that tumor-derived heat shock proteins (HSPs), introduced during
vaccination, are super-efficient at cross-presentation of limited amounts of their chaperoned tumor (peptide)
antigen. HSPs are also capable of initiating signals for co-stimulation. Both events require the HSP receptor,
CD91, expressed on dendritic cells and together allow for priming potent tumor-specific T cells. The release of
cytokines by DCs stimulated with HSPs enhances the T cell responses and activates NK cells. Our hypothesis
is that when tumor antigen levels are limiting, as in nascent emerging tumors, the HSP-CD91 pathway is
essential for cross-priming of anti-tumor immune responses. In humans, immune responses to cancer are
influenced by variable expression levels of CD91 and its polymorphism, driving the clinical and translational
relevance of this proposal. In this application we will determine how CD91 serves as an essential conduit for
initiating responses for cancer immunosurveillance."

Kidney diseases in general and acute kidney injury (AKI) in particular impose substantial morbidity and
mortality that remain unabated despite concerted efforts in recent decades to reduce both. The overall mission
of the UAB-UCSD O’Brien Center for AKI Research is to improve the health of patients by fostering research
specifically targeted to the prevention and treatment of AKI and its complications. To achieve this mission,
our two institution-based Center crosses institutional boundaries and research fields, harnessing the
momentum and ingenuity of ongoing pre-clinical and clinical research in each of our institutions and nationally.

the growing burden of this condition, the UAB-UCSD O’Brien Clinical Core (Core A) is designed to reduce the
barriers for investigators to conduct effective clinical and translational research by providing a robust
infrastructure to promote collaborative projects across pre-clinical, clinical and industry researchers. Core A will
provide multifaceted consultation through a customized Project Gateway, access to clinical databases,

Awards (CTSA) programs at both institutions for the harmonization and interrogation of big data with a focus
on personalized medicine in AKI. Specifically, Core A will facilitate collaborative digital workspaces for electronic
health record (EHR) data acquisition, transformation, validation, and interrogation. The overarching goal is to
catalyze the translation of bench discoveries to applications that impact human AKI. The Specific Aims are
structured as follows. In Aim 1, we will provide access to clinical data of patients at risk for or with AKI and
consultation for their use. Specifically, we will provide access to curated clinical data from prior clinical studies
hosted by Core A (Aim 1A) and provide access to new harmonized real-world data from the EHR to support
epidemiological surveillance of AKI (e.g., AKI incidence, risk factors and outcomes) and novel clinical research,
including but not limited to AKI risk-classification, sub-phenotyping, and simulated trials (Aim 1B). In Aim 2, we
will provide access to biospecimens of patients at risk for or with AKI and consultation for their use. Specifically,
we will provide access to biospecimens from prior studies hosted by Core A (Aim 2A). In Aim 2B we will provide
a novel platform to link biospecimens of patients at risk for or with AKI with EHR data. Core A will have dynamic

10851710,"Abstract. The intestinal epithelium (IE) lines the entire inner surface of the intestine, handling all
of the body’s nutrient and fluid uptake while simultaneously serving as a barrier to toxic luminal
contents and pathogens. To combat the damage human intestinal epithelial cells (hIECs)
accumulate during homeostasis, cells on the villi (primary absorptive surfaces) are constantly
replaced. Dedicated intestinal stem cells (hISCs) in crypts proliferate continuously to generate a
steady stream of progenitor cells that collectively migrate towards the villi in one of the most
expansive examples of collective cell migration in the adult body. Following IEC injury or loss,
nearby IECs undergo a rapid collective migration called restitution to quickly repair the damage.
Restitution driven by collective migration is an essential cellular process to preserve the barrier
against luminal contents. Despite the importance of collective cell migration to intestinal function,
little is known about how hIECs coordinate this process. The WNT-associatedPlanar Cell Polarity
(WPCP) pathway, and in particular the cell surface protein VANGL2, has been increasingly
implicated as a major player in the coordination of collective cell migration, but research is
hampered due to a major deficit of physiologically relevant model systems for studying WPCP in
higher organisms. Observations from my preliminary data indicate that: 1) sporadic
overexpression of VANGL2 is sufficient to strongly impair collective migration, 2) VANGL2 is
upregulated at the leading edge of an epithelial wound in scratchassays, and 3) a protein gradient
of VANGL2 exists along the in vivo crypt-villus axis. Together these observations led me to
hypothesize that the IE utilizes the WPCP pathway to coordinate collective cell migration.
I will test this hypothesis using two aims. Aim 1 will establish a mechanistic role for WPCP in
homeostatic migration, while Aim 2 will establish its role in wound healing. Both aims will use
novel inducible genetic models of WPCP pathway perturbations to generate primary data. This
will be used to train a computational reaction-diffusion model of WPCP polarity to decipher how
local WPCP feedback can so strongly impact collective migration of large tissue regions. This
study will fill critical technical and knowledge gaps by generating new culture models with primary
human cells, uncovering novel mechanisms of how the hIE controls collective migration, and
building novel computational models for studying collective migration and WPCP. My findings will
be significant as VANGL2 and WPCP ligands are increasingly implicated in diverse health
conditions including developmental defects, neurological and kidney disease, skeletal muscle and
biliary duct regeneration, cancer metastasis, and chronic colitis."

Despite a range of therapeutic approaches, chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) persists at a high rate, creating a public health burden. Our long-term goal is to increase access and scalability of evidence-based interventions while addressing pain care disparities for rural individuals with limited resources and/or endure long distances to specialty pain care. We will conduct a hybrid implementation-effectiveness trial, guided by the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance framework in diverse healthcare systems and communities across the United States in Texas and South Carolina focusing on rural health populations. Specifically, in our UG3 phase, we aim to plan and evaluate our Auricular Point Acupressure Self-Management (APA-SM) program integrated into rural health care and communities. Our team has accumulated extensive evidence supporting the use of APA-SM in decreasing pain intensity, reducing pain interference, and improving physical function. To maximize self-management of pain, we successfully developed and tested a smartphone APA app, an integral component of our APA-SM program, so patients can learn to self-administer APA. We also used ecological momentary assessment integrated into our app to measure real-world outcomes with participants able to self-monitor their progress using this as an innovative behavior change strategy. Our APA-SM program is theory-based according to Bandura’s self-efficacy model, toward successful initiation and maintenance of participants’ behavior change. 
In the UG3 phase, we will work with the NIH Pragmatic Trials Collaboratory Coordinating Center and collaborate extensively with our stakeholders to plan, implement, evaluate, and sustain our intervention. In the UH3 phase, using a pragmatic, randomized clinical trial, we will evaluate the clinical effectiveness of our 4-week APA-SM program. We will compare 3 groups: self-guided APA-SM, APA-SM + in-person training, and education control. The primary outcomes are pain intensity, pain interference, and function; the secondary outcomes are based on the HEAL Clinical Pain Core common data elements, and analgesic use, up to a 6-month follow-up. We will also evaluate implementation outcomes, cost-effectiveness, and predictive factors for APA-SM treatment response. A two-phase design in our UH3 will include an initiation (support for buy-in) and maintenance (no support provided) phase."

 Childhood trauma is highly prevalent in the United States, and can greatly increase the risk for developing
anxiety disorders in youth. Experiences of trauma promote heightened emotional responses to potential threats,
which in turn may impact cognitive ability. The imbalance between emotional and cognitive processes may
contribute to hallmark symptoms of anxiety disorders, such as excessive fear and impaired functioning. It is
critical to investigate the biochemical mechanisms underlying cognitive neural engagement to identify novel
therapeutic targets and develop better targeted pharmacotherapies aimed at maintaining cognitive control ability
in vulnerable populations like trauma-exposed youth.
 Functional MRI studies demonstrate that the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) is a critical
component of maintaining cognitive control, and that visual cues of negative affect may interfere with these
functions. However, the key barrier to advancing this mechanistic understanding is that the vast majority of
current investigations utilize functional MRI, which relies on the hemodynamic response function, and is an
imprecise indicator of neural engagement. A more precise measure of neural engagement can be obtained using
in vivo ¹H functional MR spectroscopy (¹H fMRS), which is a novel tool sensitive to temporal changes in glutamate
under contrasting task-conditions.
 The objective in this proposal is to investigate the impact of childhood trauma on dACC neural
engagement related to cognitive control with and without negative affect, and its association with pediatric anxiety
symptoms. We will enroll 60 adolescents (ages 11-15, 50% female) from an urban setting with high rates of
trauma exposure (30 trauma-exposed, 30 control). Participants undergo ¹H fMRS scanning while completing a
cognitive control task specifically designed to allow direct characterization of the dACC neural engagement
during cognitive control following negative affect interference. The task includes two modes that target different
components of cognition: sustained attention and response inhibition. Both modes will be tested in the context
of threatening faces (negative affect condition), as well as neutral shapes (no affect condition). This proposal
hypothesizes that childhood trauma will potentiate negative affect interference with dACC neural engagement
necessary for cognitive control functioning – demonstrated by reduced dACC glutamate modulation during the
negative affect conditions of the task.
 This innovative approach will facilitate investigation into the neural processes which maintain cognitive
control in the presence of threat in trauma-exposed adolescents. This training project will provide PI France with
training in conceptual (neurobiology of trauma and anxiety) and methodological approaches (¹H fMRS and
psychological assessments). It will also prepare the PI for a successful F32 submission and future academic
research career."

The purpose of this F31 proposal is to provide support for Cali McEntee, a doctoral student at Colorado State
University (CSU), while she trains to become an independent scientist conducting research on age-related
neurodegeneration. With support from this award, Ms. McEntee will determine if reductions in adenosine
deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) lead to the accumulation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a
pathogen-associated molecular pattern that causes innate immune/inflammatory signaling, in the context of
brain aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Numerous reports show that ADAR1 suppresses dsRNA-related
inflammation and may modulate lifespan, and that innate immune activation/neuroinflammation driven by glial
cells, like astrocytes, is a central mechanism of brain aging/AD. The applicant’s preliminary data show that
brain aging/AD are associated with reductions in ADAR1 levels, and that reducing ADAR1 expression in
astrocytes leads to an increase in transcripts from genomic repetitive elements (RE), which are increasingly
implicated in aging and neurodegeneration and predisposed to form dsRNA. As such, ADAR1 may be an
important regulator of neuroinflammation with brain aging and/or AD, perhaps by reducing RE-associated
dsRNA accumulation. However, this idea has not been investigated. In this project, Ms. McEntee proposes to
gain valuable translational research training by using multiple models to test the hypothesis that ADAR1
reduces the deleterious effects of RE-derived dsRNA and thereby protects against age/AD-related
neuroinflammation by: Aim 1) using directly reprogramed human astrocytes from healthy young/older adults
and AD patients to determine if ADAR1 and dsRNA levels are related to neuroinflammation, performing total
RNA-seq and RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (RIP-seq) to identify RE-derived dsRNAs involved in
neuroinflammation, and intersecting her findings with existing clinical datasets; and Aim 2) increasing
expression of ADAR1 in reprogrammed human astrocytes and a pre-clinical mouse model of aging to
determine if ADAR1 protects against age/AD-related neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction. Ms.
McEntee’s immediate goal is to gain the fundamental experience and professional skills necessary to perform
independent research in the field of age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Her long-term goal is to become
an academic, translational researcher investigating mechanisms of aging that contribute to neurodegenerative
disease. Ms. McEntee will train in a state-of-the-art environment with an exceptional mentoring team at CSU.
The sponsor, Dr. LaRocca, has an extensive background studying aging and neurodegenerative diseases and
directs the NIH-funded Healthspan Biology Laboratory at CSU. Under the guidance of Dr. LaRocca and
consulting mentors Drs. Chris Link, Ron Tjalkens, Julie Moreno, and Dan Lark, Ms. McEntee will be able to
successfully complete the training plan, supporting her development into an independent scientist."

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is traditionally associated with fewer identified genetic changes than other
subtypes, precluding therapies that target tumor-specific dependencies such as HER2 or ER. However, both
germline and somatic loss of homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DNA repair is a hallmark driver of TNBC.
Compared to HR repair deficiency (HRD) TNBC from white women in which genetic drivers are common, those
from women of African ancestry tend to be enriched for epigenetic silencing of HRD gene promoters through
DNA methylation. TNBCs with either genetic or epigenetic HRD are susceptible to PARP inhibitor therapy.
Unfortunately, only a fraction of HRD tumors have an identifiable genetic or epigenetic alteration, potentially
leading to missed opportunities for patients who would benefit from HRD-targeted treatment.
Epigenetic silencing of HRD gene promoters in women of African ancestry suggests that somatic alterations of
promoters could also cause HRD. However, we know very little about recurrent, functional promoter mutations
in breast cancer. This is partially caused by incomplete genomic sequencing at promoter regions due to technical
challenges in existing datasets. We have recently developed a targeted assay to deeply sequence the promoters
of >3,000 cancer gene promoters. With our innovative and unique technology at hand, we are ready to address
the central hypothesis that TNBC from women of African ancestry harbor actionable genetic driver
alterations in cancer gene promoters that induce HRD or other therapeutically relevant phenotypes. We
plan to test our hypothesis by (i) profiling ~120 TNBCs and matched normal samples from a diverse patient
population with our technology to identify candidate driver somatic mutation in promoters of HRD and other
cancer genes; (ii) associate these mutations with matched gene expression, treatment response and clinical
outcome; and (iii) pilot a functional evaluation strategy by characterizing events in the TP53 5’ region in relevant
cell line models. Our research carries the potential to identify novel genetic promoter alterations in HRD and
potentially other cancer genes in patients from diverse ancestries with aggressive TNBC. If successful, this pilot
project (i) can be scaled to investigate larger patient cohorts to discover promoter-associated driver events; and
(ii) has the multidisciplinary study team to translate potential findings into clinically relevant biomarkers for HRD-
targeted treatment in the future."
10874445,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Obesity results from an imbalance of energy that is driven by both environmental and genetic factors. While
many genomic loci are associated with obesity, several non-coding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in
the first intron of the fat mass and obesity (FTO) gene have the strongest association with obesity in humans.
The obesity-associated region containing these SNPs forms functional long-distance connections in the adult
mouse brain with the promoter of a neighboring gene iroquois homeobox protein 3 (IRX3), but NOT FTO,
suggesting that IRX3 may be a regulator of body weight gain. Interestingly, the obesity-associated SNP,
rs1421085, is highly associated with increased IRX3 expression in human brain samples and has been proposed
to increase IRX3 expression directly through interfering with the binding site of a transcriptional repressor of
IRX3. However, the mechanism and relevant brain region(s) of IRX3 function have never been reported. Thus,
there is a critical need to better understand the potential underlying mechanisms contributing to the obesity
epidemic. The overall objective of this proposal is to investigate the central circuits and mechanisms by which
IRX3, and by extension obesity-associated SNPs, influences body weight homeostasis. To accomplish this, we
have developed a novel mouse model harboring the human rs1421085 SNP (OB-SNPrs142/rs142). Importantly, OB-
SNPrs142/rs142 mice under humanized thermoneutral and high-fat diet conditions recapitulate phenotypes
associated with humans possessing the rs1421085 SNP including increased fat mass percentage and an
approximately 5% increase in bodyweight. Our preliminary data also reveals that OB-SNPrs142/rs142 mice exhibit
increased Irx3 mRNA expression in the brain in a dose-dependent manner, similar to what was reported in the
brain samples of humans harboring the risk-allele. Using a novel Irx3-CRE mouse crossed to a tdTomato reporter
mouse, we have determined that IRX3 expression in the hypothalamus is primarily expressed in neurons in the
ventral premammillary nucleus (vPM). This and additional preliminary data has led us to hypothesize that
increased IRX3 expression in the vPM of the hypothalamus alters body weight homeostasis and increases body
weight gain. This hypothesis will be evaluated through the following aims: In Aim 1, we will evaluate the
contribution of vPM IRX3 to metabolic phenotypes, by utilizing a viral vector to increase IRX3 levels in the vPM
and then monitor energy parameters. In addition, using chemogenetic activation of IRX3(+) neurons in the vPM,
we will explore the role of IRX3 neurons to regulate metabolism. In Aim 2, we will investigate potential
electrophysiological and transcriptional mechanisms through which increased expression of IRX3 in vPM
IRX3(+) neurons impacts metabolism using patch-clamp recording, single cell RNA sequencing, and chromatin
immunoprecipitation. This proposal is significant because it is the first to interrogate the physiological impact of
increased IRX3 in the vPM as the driver of the metabolic effects of the obesity-associated SNPs."
10915446,"ABSTRACT
The average life expectancy has nearly doubled in the last century, leading to increased rates of cognitive decline
in aged populations. Therefore, it is critical to identify mechanisms that restore memory function with age. One
such mechanism is activation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which is a highly conserved
transcriptional regulator of long-term associative memory (LTAM). Across species, increased CREB activity is
associated with enhanced memory with age, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not well-
understood. Recent research in C. elegans suggests that enhanced neuropeptide signaling from a single sensory
neuron, the AWC, promotes learning and extends CREB-dependent LTAM in young and aged animals.
Specifically, extended memory required 1.) neuropeptide secretion from the AWC and 2.) CREB activity in the
AIM interneuron, which is the established site of memory activity in C. elegans. These results indicate that
increased AWC neuropeptide signaling may boost cognitive healthspan in C. elegans. However, the memory-
promoting neuropeptide(s) and whether their mechanism of action regulates learning or CREB-dependent
memory is unknown. Furthermore, AWC neuropeptide signals regulate a variety of neuronal phenotypes that
decline with age, including chemotaxis, locomotory behaviors, and egg-laying. Interestingly, we have found that
increased AWC peptide release significantly reduces the rate of matricidal egg hatching—a neuronally-regulated
phenotype that occurs more frequently in aged animals—suggesting AWC peptide signaling also promotes the
healthspan of neuronal circuitry. Although, how AWC peptide signaling regulates the healthspan of other
neuronal phenotypes has yet to be investigated. From these findings, we hypothesize that AWC-specific
neuropeptide signaling promotes learning and CREB-dependent memory with age and extends neuronal
healthspan in C. elegans. We will test this hypothesis by performing a highly targeted RNAi screen to identify
AWC neuropeptide signals that promote learning, CREB activity in the AIM, and LTAM. Then, we will identify the
corresponding receptors, which are largely conserved, druggable targets that may be tested in higher organisms.
Finally, we will perform a battery of AWC-driven behaviors to determine the role of AWC neuropeptide signaling
in extending neuronal healthspan phenotypes. Overall, this research will provide insight into the molecular
underpinnings of age-related cognitive decline, potentially leading to novel therapeutic targets for cognitive
impairment in higher organisms."

Clostridioides difficile is an anaerobic spore-forming pathogen that causes around 500,000 infections, 13,000
deaths, and healthcare costs of around 1 billion dollars annually in the United States. C. difficile infections cause
severe diarrhea and inflammation of the colon. Infection is transmitted by ingestion of C. difficile spores, which
can survive oxygen, disinfectants, chemicals, and radiation. After ingestion, spores germinate into vegetative
cells within the intestine. These vegetative cells colonize the gastrointestinal tract, generating toxins and forming
more spores. Spore formation is triggered by nutritional deprivation of the pathogen in the gastrointestinal tract.
Nutrient availability is are sensed in C. difficile by specific transcriptional regulators, such as CodY. CodY is a
global transcription regulator that is present in low G + C Gram-positive bacteria and responds to intracellular
concentrations of branched-chain amino acids and GTP. Although it is known that C. difficile codY mutants
hyper-sporulate, the means by which CodY represses sporulation is not currently understood. Based on the
sporulation repression by CodY and its role as a transcriptional regulator, I hypothesize that CodY
regulates sporulation by controlling the expression of a sporulation factor(s). In preliminary studies, I
performed transcriptomic analyses of codY and wild-type strains, in combination with mapping of CodY-binding
sites and transcriptional knockdown. Through these experiments I identified direct CodY-regulated factors that
impact sporulation. The top three candidate genes are CDR20291_1334, CDR20291_1851-1853, and
CDR20291_2485-2486. To test the hypothesis, I propose to complete these Specific Aims: Aim 1, I will assess
the roles of CDR20291_1334, CDR20291_1851-1853, and CDR20291_2485-2486 in sporulation by generating
null mutants and subsequently analyzing their contribution to sporulation and transcriptional profiles. Also, I will
characterize the basic functions of these genes in C. difficile using growth curves, fluorescent microscopy, and
co-immunoprecipitation experiments. In Aim 2, I will compare CodY binding to these target genes on wild-type
alleles and variants containing mutated CodY binding sites by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, followed by
assessment of the impact of CodY-dependent regulation on sporulation frequency via complementation studies
with these genes containing wild-type and mutated CodY boxes. The completion of these aims will identify CodY-
regulated genes that control sporulation and uncover their role in sporulation regulation through CodY."
10884216,"Abstract:
Light-inducible regulatory proteins are powerful tools to interrogate the fundamental mechanisms driving
cellular behavior. To this end, genetically encoded photosensory domains fused to split proteins can tightly
modulate protein activity and gene expression. While light-inducible split protein systems have performed well
individually, few multichromatic and orthogonal gene regulation systems exist in mammalian cells. Existing
multi-input circuits are hampered by their type of regulation and the scale of possible outputs given the number
of wavelengths. I will address this limitation by creating a library of red and blue light-inducible split
recombinases and the first suite of split Cas13 ribonucleases. Site specific recombinases provide permanent
and transgene outputs, while Cas13 ribonucleases will provide a complementary approach to modulate
reversible analog transcriptomic outputs. The multiplexed optogenetic tools developed in this proposal will be
transformative for understanding the role of multiple interacting genes in endogenous signaling networks. I will
leverage the ability of C2C12 myoblasts to differentiate into osteoblasts or myotubes and encode an
illumination-dependent cell fate switch. While C2C12 cells have been a fundamental model in studying how
differentiation is impacted by mechanical cues and growth factors, this work will explore spatiotemporal control
of optogenetic regulatory proteins in order to direct cell fate."
10916478,"Therapeutic agents that target the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have achieved remarkable
success in patients with the neovascular form of age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). An emerging
clinical problem, however, is that many of the nAMD patients develop subretinal fibrosis (SRF) after receiving
anti-VEGF therapy. SRF can cause irreversible structural damage to the retina and is a major vision-
threatening complication with no effective treatment. The disease mechanisms of SRF in nAMD are largely
unknown. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) is a major driver of fibrosis. The source of TGF-beta in
SRF, and its main effector cells, have not been well defined. SRF can be modeled in mice with spontaneous or
experimentally-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV). In our published and preliminary studies, we found
that mice with targeted deletion in the very low-density lipoprotein receptor (Vldlr) gene developed SRF when
their CNV lesions regressed. Using single cell RNA sequencing, we identified endothelial precursor cells
(EPCs) as a major cluster of cells that displayed markers of fibrosis. Similar findings were observed in JR5558
mice and in laser-induced CNV. EPCs have stem cell-like properties, and they are recruited to the choroidal
and retinal neovessels to facilitate the vascular repair. In the subretinal microenvironment, EPCs gradually lose
their cellular structures and transdifferentiate into fibroblast-like cells. We hypothesize that TGF-beta-mediated
metabolic reprograming of EPCs is a key signaling event that contributes to the formation and progression of
SRF after CNV. For the project proposed in this application, we will determine the roles of EPCs in mouse
models of CNV and in human donor eye tissues with wet AMD. We will also examine the metabolic
reprogramming of EPCs in response to TGF-beta. Furthermore, we will explore whether Muller cell-derived IL-
33 promotes TGF-beta production from macrophages, and whether inhibiting the IL-33 signaling suppresses
SRF. Results from these studies will reveal novel molecular and cellular mechanisms of SRF, and define new
targets for potential therapeutic intervention."

This renewal application builds on our successful RAPID EC (RCT Assessing Pregnancy with Intrauterine
Devices for Emergency Contraception) trial, which demonstrated that the levonorgestrel (LNG) 52 mg IUD is
effective for emergency contraception (EC) and noninferior to the copper T380A for EC. In the RAPID EC trial
there was 1 pregnancy among 317 LNG IUD EC users, (pregnancy risk of 0.3%, 95% CI 0-1.7%). We
published the study results in the New England Journal of Medicine, and within months Planned Parenthood
Federation of America’s (PPFA) National Medical Committee used our data to adopt new contraceptive care
guidelines. Today, over 600+ PPFA health centers in the U.S. offer the LNG 52 mg IUD to individuals with a
negative pregnancy test for 2 new situations: a) EC: within 5 days of unprotected intercourse and b) non-EC
same-day start at any point in the menstrual cycle regardless of recent unprotected intercourse. However, the
LNG 52 mg IUD prescribing information and CDC, WHO, and ACOG clinical guidelines, which guide clinical
care outside of PPFA, currently do not recommend placement in either of these 2 new situations. The current
guidelines recommend that those not within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle and report any unprotected
intercourse (UPI) in the cycle must delay LNG IUD placement and return after the next menses starts. This
creates an access barrier and increases the risk of undesired pregnancy.
Our goal is to assess reproducibility of RAPID EC’s findings by determining the effectiveness of the LNG 52
mg IUD to prevent pregnancy for EC and same-day start in real-world settings where users select their
treatment (and are not randomized to it as in the RAPID EC trial). With guidance from a Reproductive Justice
expert, we will test reproducibility and generalizability in a larger, more diverse population, to assess
whether practice guidelines and standards of care should be revised. To accomplish this we will enroll 1,404
participants at 8 PPFA affiliates with one of three situations where current guidelines limit access but data
support low pregnancy risk. The three groups are: 1) EC regular-cycle group - LNG IUD EC users who have
had UPI within 5 days and have a known last menstrual period and regular menstrual cycles (inclusion criteria
from the RAPID EC trial), 2) Same-day start (not EC) group - people choosing the LNG IUD for contraception
> 7 days after onset of menses without reported UPI within 5 days, 3) EC unknown- or irregular- cycle
group - individuals choosing the LNG IUD for EC without a known last menstrual period or regular menstrual
cycle. All groups will undergo noninferiority comparisons. Group 1 will be compared to the historical data from
the LNG IUD participants in the RAPID EC trial. Group 2 and 3 will be compared to group 1. For all groups we
expect one-month pregnancy rates <1%. Rigorous, reproducible, and generalizable data on LNG 52 mg IUD
use for EC or same-day start from more heterogenous populations could inform millions of people’s IUD
access globally."
10899661,"Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is emerging as a major worldwide cause of liver disease in children and adults. Recent studies demonstrate substantial heterogeneity in the phenotype of macrophages (MFs) infiltrating the liver during NASH. Recruited MFs exist as two subsets, with distinct activation states: (1) those closely resembling homeostatic Kupffer cells (KCs), or (2) lipid-associated MFs (LAMs). In 2020, a cluster of LAMs with high expression of osteopontin (OPN) was identified in livers with NASH. Notably, LAMs are differentially activated, compared to resident- and monocyte-derived KCs, and with a distinct ability to metabolize lipids. However, whether they also crosstalk with neighboring cells, to prevent steatosis and fibrosis in NASH, remains unknown. While recruitment of MFs into the liver, and subsequent activation, are considered proinflammatory and profibrotic events, currently a significant knowledge gap is a lack of understanding of whether OPNHigh MFs, are detrimental or protective in NASH. Preliminary data demonstrates that Spp1KI Mye are protected, whereas Spp1ΔMye have worse NASH activity scores than WT mice. Thus, our results suggest a paradigm shift, in that OPNHigh MFs may protect from NASH. Yet, the intercellular communication, and preventive and therapeutic potential of OPNHigh MFs, remain to be determined. Our overarching hypothesis is that OPNHigh MFs, by signaling to hepatocytes (HEPs) and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), reduce liver steatosis and fibrosis, and protect from NASH. Aim 1 is to identify how OPNHigh MFs protect from steatosis. We hypothesize that OPNHigh MFs signal HEPs to upregulate arginase-2 (ARG2), which increases mitochondrial bioenergetics and fatty acid oxidation (FAO), reduces nitrosative stress, and protects from steatosis. To test this, first, we will identify the OPNHigh MF ‘secretome’ proteins that signal HEPs to upregulate ARG2; second, we will determine how the identified OPNHigh MF secretome proteins transactivate the ARG2 promoter, in HEPs; and third, we will elucidate how ARG2 increases mitochondrial bioenergetics and FAO, and reduces nitrosative stress, in HEPs. Aim 2 is to dissect how OPNHigh MFs protect from fibrosis. We hypothesize that OPNHigh MFs signal through secretome proteins to lower collagen-I, and/or modify the ‘matrisome’ landscape, to prevent fibrosis, and regulate cell behavior, in NASH. To prove this, first, we will identify the OPNHigh MF secretome proteins that signal HSCs to lower collagen-I deposition and/or increase its degradation; second, we will analyze whether OPNHigh MFs modify the matrisome landscape, and establish the OPNHigh MF-ECM correlation network; and third, we will perform liver scRNA-seq, and computationally identify how the OPNHigh MF-ECM network regulates cell behavior in NASH."

The physiological underpinning of motor symptoms in Parkinson disease (PD) remains incompletely understood.
We propose that the dynamic nature of basal ganglia thalamocortical (BGTC) network activity accounts for and
is critical for understanding the dynamic symptomatology of PD and the pathophysiology of disease. We believe
that the failure to focus on and investigate the non-stationarity of BGTC physiology and movement kinematics
significantly contributes to inconsistency in published results and has impeded progress. We propose and
investigate a novel model that accounts for the underexplored temporally dynamic cascade of physiological
events occurring between nodes in the BGTC motor circuit. We hypothesize that transient exaggerations in
network-level coupling that result in impaired information flow trigger pathophysiological and motor sequelae of
PD, including rigidity and bradykinesia, allowing for and differentiating pathological and non-pathological
synchrony. We hypothesize that the likelihood of pathological synchrony resulting in impaired information flow
depends on the “movement” state, accounting for disproportionate difficulty with movement initiation in PD. We
also hypothesize that treatment (dopaminergic and deep brain stimulation [DBS]) decreases the probability of a
synchrony-triggered pathological cascade, with some common final changes in the network (e.g., cortical phase
amplitude coupling) but with specific differences in physiological effects due to distinct sites of therapeutic action.
We will build on prior success of investigating PD network physiology in patients undergoing DBS implantation
surgery by simultaneously assessing population level activity from multiple BGTC nodes, including motor cortex,
dorsal premotor cortex (to where pallidal-receiving thalamic regions project), subthalamic nucleus (STN), and
globus pallidus (GPi, in separate patients), in relation to clinical symptoms and behavior. We now also integrate
single unit physiology and synchronized dynamic tasks to test our model. In Aim 1, we will establish the dynamic
relationship between network synchronization, local oscillations, and pathophysiologic sequelae under different
therapeutic conditions, including STN and GPi DBS and dopaminergic therapy. We hypothesize an increased
probability of synchrony leading to pathologic sequelae in the “off” state and test specific hypotheses about both
common and distinct physiological effects of the different therapies, depending on site of action. In Aim 2, we
hypothesize and aim to demonstrate that movement-related brain states affect sequelae of network synchrony
both physiologically and behaviorally, differentially impacting movement initiation and ongoing activity. Finally,
in Aim 3, we will distinguish normal and pathologic synchrony (across therapeutic and movement conditions)
using a novel information theoretic frameowrk, with a focus on the impact of criticality, complexity matching, and
impairments in information flow. This work will enhance the BGTC functional wiring diagram by defining the
pathophysiologic significance of network synchrony in PD. Addressing this gap will facilitate therapeutic
innovations, including identification of signals for adaptive DBS and to guide pharmacologic innovation."
10749928,"Peripheral neuropathies affect more than 20 million people in the United States. Patients with peripheral
neuropathies suffer from debilitating motor and sensory deficits that can cause severe pain and paralysis.
Many forms of inherited peripheral neuropathies impair Schwann cell function and result in abnormal myelin
production or demyelination, which is thought to be the underlying cause of the motor and sensory deficits.
Schwann cells intimately associate with axons to organize peripheral nerves during development and to
insulate axons with myelin. The NRG1/ERBB signaling pathway allows for Schwann cells and axons to
communicate with each other and provides essential instructions that regulate Schwann cell proliferation,
migration and myelination. Modulation of the NRG1/ERBB signaling pathway can restore function to several
rodent models of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). Therefore, identifying the mechanisms that control
NRG1/ERBB signaling has important implications for the treatment of peripheral neuropathies. Our data from
mice and cell culture experiments indicate that the endosome is a critical regulator of ERBB2/3 function during
myelination. To investigate the endosomal pathways controlling ERBB2/3 signaling, we have developed mouse
models that impair endosomal sorting of internalized cell surface receptors. We have focused on hepatocyte
growth factor regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HGS), which directs the sorting of internalized receptors
through the endosome. HGS expression is diminished in two different mouse models of CMT, implicating
defective endosomal sorting as a cause for demyelinating neuropathies. Our data now indicate that loss of
HGS in Schwann cells replicates many features of inherited peripheral nerve disorders, including motor and
sensory deficits and dysmyelination of sciatic nerves. Impairing endosomal function by deleting the Hgs gene
specifically in Schwann cells also showed that ERBB2/3 receptor signaling is dependent upon endosomal
sorting to activate its downstream signaling pathways. In addition, we have identified a novel endosomal
protein complex in Schwann cells that occurs during myelination. To test the hypothesis that endosomal sorting
regulates ERBB2/3 function during myelination, Aim 1 will determine the role of endosomal sorting in Schwann
cells for the development and function of peripheral nerves, and Aim 2 will determine how endocytic trafficking
controls the sorting and signaling of the ERBB2/3 receptors in Schwann cells. To investigate the mechanism
regulating ERBB2/3 function in Schwann cells, Aim 3 will determine which HGS interacting protein complexes
are required for ERBB2/3 sorting and signaling in Schwann cells. The completion of this proposal is expected
to provide novel insights on the endosomal biology of Schwann cells and further our understanding of how
endosomal sorting controls ERBB receptor signaling during myelination. Our long-range goals are to determine
the regulatory pathways that control endosomal function in Schwann cells in order to identify targets for the
treatment of demyelinating diseases such as CMT."
10749931,"The overarching goal of this project is to determine the role of angiotensin converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) in the diabetic gut, how it impacts hyperglycemia and glycemic variability, and thus contributes to
the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy (DR). The protective arm of the renin angiotensin system (RAS)
consists of ACE2, which converts angiotensin II (Ang-II) to angiotensin 1-7 (Ang-1-7). Ang-1-7 opposes
the effects of Ang-II by virtue of its actions on the MAS receptor. While the systemic (endocrine) RAS
works with local (tissue) RAS such as that in the eye and gut to achieve homeostasis in health, in
diabetes loss of key components of the protective RAS can lead to widespread pathology. The literature
and our preliminary data support that diabetes results in loss of expression of ACE2 in the gut, bone
marrow, and retina. Glycemic variability is implicated in DR pathogenesis. Intestinal ACE2 can regulate
glucose homeostasis by modulating tryptophan absorption and incretin release and by generating Ang 1-
7 from luminal Ang II. Ang 1-7 by binding to Mas receptor can block glucose transport in the gut similar to
what has been described in the pancreas. Based on this, we hypothesis: In T2D, loss of enterocyte
ACE2 decreases: i) tryptophan
uptake and incretin secretion
leading to hyperglycemia; ii) MAS
receptor activation increasing gut glucose absorption; and iii) gut barrier integrity resulting in
leakage of gut microbial peptides into the circulation. All three mechanisms increase retinal
permeability and activating immune cells promoting DR pathology. Aim 1 will test if dysregulation of
ACE2 in the gut epithelium results in i) interruption of tryptophan transport by B0AT1 decreasing incretin
secretion and ii) reduced MAS receptor activation leading to increased glucose absorption in the gut.
Aim 2 will test if in db/db mice, loss of intestinal ACE2 will result in increasing circulating levels of gut
microbial peptides that will activate TLRs on retinal endothelial cells and lead to increased retinal
leukostasis and blood retinal barrier dysfunction. Aim 3 will examine if nutraceuticals or probiotics can
restore the balance of the intestinal RAS (ACE2/Ang-1-7/MAS) in db/db mice to prevent development of
DR. Impact: We propose a novel mechanism for deterioration of glucose homeostasis and increased
glucose variability in diabetes- the loss of function of the ACE2:B0AT1 oligomer form of ACE2 (unique to
the intestinal epithelium) and reduced levels of intestinal Ang 1-7 resulting in less intestinal MAS receptor
activation. The dysregulated intestinal RAS can lead to serious retinal pathology promoting DR."

HIV-1-associated inflammation and chronic immune activation persist despite suppressive antiretroviral
therapy and are strongly linked to the development of comorbidities and increased mortality. The
gastrointestinal (GI) tract is likely a major source of chronic inflammation, as early HIV-1 replication and CD4 T
cell depletion in the gut results in mucosal inflammation and barrier dysfunction, leading to the translocation of
enteric microbes/microbial products into the lamina propria and the systemic circulation. To gain insights into
the molecular processes that drive gut-focused chronic immune activation, we profiled the transcriptome of gut
CD4+CD8α- T cells exposed to gram-negative enteric bacteria and then infected with HIV-1 ex vivo. Multiple
granzyme genes were upregulated following microbe exposure that was further enhanced with HIV-1 infection,
suggesting the synergistic induction of CD4 cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity. In pilot ex vivo studies, the
human gut CD4 CTL phenotype was associated with granzyme (GZ) B expression, TCR signaling, Th1/17
polyfunctionality, reactivity to commensal bacteria and subsets expressing GZA, perforin and/or CD107a. The
CD4 CTL phenotype was expressed in CD4 T cells from the gut to a much greater extent than from peripheral
blood and lymphoid tissue. Importantly, HIV-1 replicated to a greater extent in gut CD4 CTLs ex vivo. Here, we
hypothesize that gut CD4 CTLs are uniquely primed to respond to enteric microbes, are highly
susceptible to HIV-1 mediated killing, and play critical roles in mucosal HIV-1 pathogenesis via
cytolytic and pro-inflammatory mechanisms. To gain insights on the role of gut CD4 CTLs in HIV-1
pathogenesis, we propose 3 aims. In Aim 1, we will determine if microbiome species and ligands induce gut
CD4 CTLs in an MHC-II-dependent manner, obtain insights into gut CD4 CTL origin and function by single-cell
transcriptomics, and investigate the stability and fate of these cells ex vivo. In Aim 2, we will determine how
HIV-1 infection further augments GZB production in gut CD4 T cells and using our ex vivo lamina propria
aggregate culture (LPAC) model, determine if gut CD4 CTLs exacerbate direct and bystander HIV-1-mediated
CD4 T cell death via cytolytic mechanisms. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the triggers for GZ secretion and dissect
the non-cytolytic, pro-inflammatory properties of GZs secreted by microbe-exposed gut CD4 T cells ex vivo.
Importantly, we will explore the in vivo relationship between CD4 CTL frequencies and markers of mucosal and
systemic inflammation in archived plasma and gut biopsies from well-characterized cohorts of both untreated
and treated persons with chronic HIV-1 infection. Altogether, these studies should provide critical
information on this striking gut immune cell subpopulation and its contribution to mucosal
inflammation and disease."

 This Pathway to Independence Award will equip the candidate with the key skills to study interpersonal
connectedness by examining behavioral and physiological linkage (e.g., how closely people’s heart rates and
emotional behaviors are synchronized) in individuals with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and their spousal
caregivers (CGs). FTD is associated with profound neurodegeneration in the frontal and temporal regions of the
brain and severe socioemotional symptoms (e.g., apathy, disinhibition) that are difficult not only for the person
with dementia (PWD) but also for the CG. Caring for a loved one with FTD can be a meaningful part of family
life; however, disruptive symptoms can produce deleterious effects and undermine CGs’ health and well-being.
Given the strong associations established between close interpersonal connectedness and health/well-being,
the candidate plans to take novel steps to examine (a) how interpersonal connectedness of the PWD and CG is
altered in FTD (Aims 1 and 3), and (b) how altered PWD-CG connectedness provides a bridge that links
PWD’s socioemotional symptoms to CG’s health declines (Aim 2). Importantly, the candidate plans to study
PWD-CG connectedness by assessing both behavioral and physiological indicators of PWD-CG
connectedness. This novel approach will provide more objective, less cognitive-demanding, and more
continuous measures for PWD-CG connectedness, as compared to single self-report measures that have
typically been used in past research. The candidate also plans to develop the optimal methodological approach
for quantifying PWD-CG connectedness in both laboratory and naturalistic settings (e.g., identify the measure of
physiological linkage that best predicts poor CG health; Aim 4). The candidate has received solid training in
cognitive neuroscience and has a strong track record using integrative methods to study emotion and social
functioning in healthy and clinical populations. To support the candidate in conducting the proposed research,
training in 3 areas is planned: (a) dyadic behavioral and physiological time series data analysis, (b) diagnosis
and clinical assessment of FTD, and (c) dementia caregiving. Training will occur under the mentorship of
renowned experts in each field (including a clinical psychologist, a behavioral neurologist, and a nurse
specialist). The training environment at the Department of Psychology, University of California, Berkeley
(primary), and the Memory and Aging Center, University of California, San Francisco (secondary), will be ideal
for the proposed training and research, as well as for developing the candidate’s professional skills. Together,
the award will help the candidate launch his research career as an independent scientist with unique expertise
in dyadic emotion and psychophysiology, neurodegenerative disease, and caregiving. The proposed research
will help advance the understanding of the pathways through which FTD yields collateral damage on CGs, and
provide a novel, objective, continuous, and potentially portable measure to quantify PWD-CG connectedness
for future research and clinical use."

Myocardial remuscularization by cardiac patch delivery of epicardial FSTL1 and CCND2
 overexpressing cardiomyocytes
Project Summary
Despite undergoing intensive treatment regimens, patients with severe acute myocardial infarction (AMI) often
end up with end stage congestive heart failure (CHF). From the molecular and cellular perspective, heart failure
occurs due to the loss of the contractile unit of the left ventricle: cardiomyocytes (CMs). Therefore, promotion of
myocyte proliferation and understanding the regulators of myocyte cell cycle could have highly significant impact
on the management of heart failure. In this proposal, we seek to develop 3D bioengineered cardiac muscle
constructs that incorporate a functional vascular network and recapitulate some of the key microenvironmental
cues of native heart tissue. Our recent studies have identified main biomechanical and molecular cues that can
significantly enhance cell cycle re-entry of adult CMs. We demonstrated that epicardial application of a cardiac
patch, laden with follistatin like-1 (FSTL1) protein, protected the mouse and pig heart against AMI, left ventricle
dilatation, and heart failure. We recently reported that overexpression of a cell cycle gene, CCND2 (cyclin D2),
induces proliferation of transplanted human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) derived-CMs. This proposal
builds upon our recent technological achievements, enabling cast or bioprinting of major cardiac cells and
hydrogels at high spatial resolution (20 µm) to fabricate 3D perfusable vascular constructs. Our central
hypothesis is that 3D cardiac constructs, laden with FSTL1 and hiPSC-CCND2 CMs, can synergistically
remuscularize ischemic myocardium. We test this hypothesis in three integrated Specific Aims (SAs). In SA1,
we will utilize our cast/bioprinted 3D cardiac tissue models to identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms
underlying myocyte pro-proliferative effect of FSTL1 treatment in vitro. In SA2, we will assess the identified
signaling pathways, involved in FSTL1-CCND2 CM-patch effect, to promote remuscularization in mouse model
of MI (both acute and chronic). In SA3a, we will assess the pre-clinical potential of bioengineered pre-
vascularized muscle patch device in treating AMI in a pig model of ischemia-reperfusion. We will compare the
efficacy of open chest delivery versus a novel minimally invasive, catheter-based, pericardial delivery of FSTL1
and CCND2 CM laden muscle patch to the epicardium. SA3b, we will evaluate the effectiveness of the
engineered patch for preventing the LV dilatation without inducing arrhythmogenic complications. The panoramic
optical mapping and transmural electrical EP mapping whole heart will assess the electromechanical integration
between the muscle patch constructs and recipient myocardium. The findings from these EP studies will guide
the design of new generations of cell lines and patch constructs with improved EP characteristics, thereby

10751037,"Project summary. During lytic infection, the AIDS-associated tumor virus Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated
herpesvirus (KSHV) blocks cells from activating the anti-viral type I interferon (IFN) responses. This block of
the innate immune response facilitates efficient viral replication, which in turn contributes to development of
Kaposi’s sarcoma. Thus, elucidating the mechanisms by which KSHV evades the host innate immune
response may provide insights on how to target this and other KSHV-induced tumors. However, because of
the complex and redundant nature of the type I IFN induction pathway, how KSHV blocks this early antiviral
response is still incompletely understood. In a previous study, we found that the host protease caspase-8 is a
major mediator of type I IFN inhibition by KSHV. KSHV reactivation from latency only triggers minimal type I
IFN induction, but there is a much stronger transcriptional induction and secretion of type I IFNs when
caspase-8 is also inhibited. This stronger IFN induction, in turn, reduces KSHV reactivation. These results
indicate that caspase-8 activity is necessary to inhibit IFN induction, and thus promotes KSHV replication.
This finding was surprising because caspase-8 activation is generally considered antiviral as it induces
apoptotic cell death. However, we do not detect wide-spread cell death during reactivation from latency
despite caspase-8 activation, suggesting that caspase-8 is hijacked and repurposed by KSHV to inhibit type I
IFN responses. At present, the molecular mechanisms that lead to caspase-8 activity and the pathways that
are targeted by caspase-8 to control type I IFN during KSHV infection remain unclear. We have new
preliminary data suggesting that caspase-8 is activated by a pathogen sensing pathway, the Toll-like receptor
(TLR) pathway, as a cellular response to infection. Caspase-8 then proceeds to inhibit a different pathogen
sensing pathway, cGAS-mediated DNA sensing. Therefore, we hypothesize that KSHV is taking advantage
of a TLR-mediated cellular response to infection that activates caspase-8. KSHV is then able to redirect this
activity to inhibit DNA sensing instead of activating apoptosis. We will test this hypothesis and determine how
caspase-8 is activated by TLR signaling in KSHV-infected cells without triggering cell death (Aim 1), and
which host protein(s) are cleaved by caspase-8 to block cGAS-induced type I IFN responses (Aim 2).
Moreover, we will also investigate whether and how caspase activity is connected to other previously
described mechanisms of immune evasion by KSHV (Aim 3). As caspase-8 is a druggable target,
understanding how caspase-8 is used by KSHV to regulate type I IFNs and promote its replication will reveal
whether and how this enzyme could be exploited for KSHV therapy. This is important as there are no target
therapies for this virus, and Kaposi’s sarcoma remains one of the leading types of cancers in sub-Saharan
Africa and the second most common AIDS-associated malignancy in the US. This project will also uncover
fundamental aspects of caspase signaling that may play a role in other diseases connected to IFN."
10929375,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This project aims to use human cortical organoids, which are cortex-like structures generated in vitro from
human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), to resolve outstanding questions in our understanding of
causal mechanisms underlying the mesoscale phenomenology of anesthetic induction (AI) and anesthetic
emergence (AE). Millions of patients undergo general anesthesia every year, but the mechanisms by which
anesthetic drugs give rise to the hallmarks of AI remain unresolved. Even less well understood are the
mechanisms by which the brain emerges from anesthesia - a process over which clinicians have almost no
control, and which is frequently associated with complications such as emergence delirium, respiratory events,
and delayed emergence, which results in prolonged hospital stays and increased cost of care. In addition, 1-2
per every 1000 patients will experience intraoperative awareness with explicit recall, for reasons that are not
understood. While a number of hypotheses regarding the mechanisms of AI and AE have been put forward,
these hypotheses are still debated because of complex inter-circuit interactions during AI and AE in the intact
brain. In particular, it is widely believed that the major cause of AI is the potentiation of cortical GABAa
receptors, but it has been difficult to disentangle the effects of cortical GABAa potentiation from the subcortical
effects of anesthesia, which may likewise contribute to AI. Similarly, though it is generally believed that at least
one, if not several cortically projecting neuromodulatory structures - including the histaminergic
tuberomammillary nucleus of the hypothalamus, the cholinergic basal forebrain, the serotonergic raphe nuclei,
the orexinergic lateral hypothalamus, and the noradrenergic locus coeruleus - directly drive emergence from
anesthesia, these systems are densely interconnected and mutually excitatory. For this reason, in vivo
research has been unable to resolve which, if any, of these systems directly cause AE. A promising but
completely unexplored tool for resolving these questions are human cortical organoids. Our team has recently
developed a protocol for fusing together networks of excitatory and inhibitory cortical-like neurons derived from
hiPSCs. These fusion cortical organoids can recapitulate the oscillatory electric activity of the awake human
cortex, and our preliminary results suggest that these cortical organoids can mimic the mesoscale hallmarks of
AI when they are exposed to the anesthetic propofol. Importantly, cortical organoids consist of purely cortical-
like human tissue, and lack any influence from subcortical structures or neuromodulatory systems. This allows
us to use human cortical organoids to isolate cortical versus non-cortical causal mechanisms of both AI and
AE. Successful modeling of AI and AE in brain organoids would illustrate the utility of these structures in high-
throughput screening of novel drugs for inducing anesthesia or emergence from anesthesia, potentially even
on a single-patient basis. Additionally, this project would establish the potential for human brain organoids in
screening therapies for other states of unconsciousness, such as coma and persistent vegetative states."
10930112,"Abstract
Human cancers are highly heterogeneous, arising from genetic, epigenetic, genomic, and gene environment
interactions. Studying single-cell cancer heterogeneity is essential for effective diagnosis, prognosis and
development of personalized anti-cancer therapy. However, single-cell level tumor heterogeneity in situ with the
original spatial context is not addressed until very recently, with development of new frontier technological
platforms such as spatial transcriptomics (ST) and single cell imaging mass cytometry (IMC). Due to complexity
of these new spatial data types, computation is a major bottle neck to bring these technologies to precision
therapeutic interventions in the clinical space. In this project, we take a three-pronged approach to propose a
series of novel computational methods that will harness the power of spatially informative omics and imaging
data, for drug treatment and cancer patient prognosis predictions. Building upon a previously highly productive
R01 project, we aim to continue investigations in single cell research, with a new focus on single-cell spatial
data analysis. First, we will develop a novel personalized drug repurposing algorithm called STADS using
cancer spatial transcriptomics data. Next, build a new computational model STimpute to impute spatial
transcriptomics data from easily accessible histopathology image data, using transfer learning and graph neural
network (GNN) models. STimpute will allow predictions of drugs from histopathology data, by using imputed ST
data as the proxy input of STADS. Lastly, we will build a new computational framework scImageProg to predict
patient survival at the population level from the single-cell image cytometry data, accomplishing multi-scale
modeling to link single-cell data to population health. The work will be expected to have transformative clinical
impacts from various cutting-edge spatially informative and complex genomics and imaging data types."
10749339,"Background: Family-centered ICU care—an evidence-based approach that prioritizes family members’
presence in the ICU, incorporates them as care partners, and responds to their values and needs—improves
outcomes for patients, families, and clinicians. The Society of Critical Care Medicine recommends the routine
use of practices within four key family-centered care domains: 1) unrestricted family presence and participation
in care; 2) daily communication between care teams and families; 3) regular use of educational/bereavement
materials; and 4) integration of interdisciplinary personnel (e.g., social workers, chaplains) into the care team.
However, family-centered ICU care remains underutilized across U.S. hospitals. There is an urgent need to
ensure family-centered ICU care is being delivered as standard of care for Veterans and their families.
Significance: The objective of this study is to ensure VA ICUs consistently deliver family-centered care. The
central hypothesis is that current practices vary widely and are not tailored to the specific needs of Veterans or
their families. This proposal directly aligns with VA’s Whole Health Initiative and Strategic Priorities for
Research by prioritizing what matters to Veterans and their families and by informing efforts to provide more
equitable care. It will also increase the real-world impact of VA research by leading to a future implementation
trial that tests strategies to ensure family-centered ICU care is delivered consistently across VA.
Innovation & Impact: This proposal will be the first national study to evaluate the delivery of family-centered
care within VA ICUs. Additionally, its mixed methods approach will probe the intersection between care models
unique to VA (e.g., telecritical care), important subgroups of Veterans (racial/ethnic/rural minorities), and the
delivery of family-centered care. This study will inform efforts to tailor family-centered care to the unique needs
of Veterans and their families and within the context of VA’s organizational structure and available resources.
Specific Aims: 1) To characterize family-centered ICU care practices across VA and evaluate hospital-level
factors associated with the delivery of specific practices; 2) To evaluate enablers and barriers to family-
centered ICU care practices through the perspectives of Veterans, their families, and ICU clinicians; 3) To
develop a strategic plan that promotes implementation of family-centered ICU care practices across VA.
Methodology: Aim 1 will survey ICU nurse managers from VA hospitals with ICUs nationally (n~115) to
characterize delivery of family-centered care practices and then examine the association between hospital-
level characteristics and the use of specific family-centered ICU care practices. Aim 2 will sample 6-8 VA
hospitals based on geographic region, rurality, and Veteran demographics. Site visits with observations and
semi-structured interviews of up to 72 key stakeholders, including Veterans, their families, and ICU staff, will be
conducted. Aim 3 will convene a modified Delphi panel of ~20 subjects, including Veterans, families, clinicians,
and administrators. The study team will then develop a strategic plan to promote the implementation of family-
centered care practices that are tailored to Veterans and their families within the context of VA.
Next Steps/Implementation: The strategic plan will be disseminated using a multi-faceted approach, building
on the study team’s relationships with multiple government offices to reach VA ICUs across the U.S. As a next
step, the study team anticipates testing these implementation strategies in a type III hybrid effectiveness-
implementation trial, which will leverage the network of VA ICUs that will be created as part of this study."
10929362,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a disease characterized by pulmonary vascular remodeling and poor gas
exchange, and eventually leads to right ventricular failure and death. Elevated heart and respiratory muscle
workloads contribute to diaphragm and cardiac impairments in PH; however, the physiological and molecular
bases are not fully understood. Vascular function is compromised in PH, resulting in an inability to match
oxygen delivery to demand, which is of increasing importance in the overworked diaphragm and heart.
However, the mechanisms underlying PH-induced vascular dysfunction and, arguably more important, targets
for mitigating such dysfunction remain unknown. Upregulation of reactive oxygen species and inflammatory
cytokines are thought to promote PH pathogenesis, which suggests that modulation of intracellular redox
pathways may serve as one potential mechanism responsible for the impaired vasomotor control with PH and
provides a potential therapeutic target to improve the compromised vascular function in PH.
Preliminary data supports that PH impairs endothelial-dependent and -independent vasorelaxation in
diaphragm arterioles, and therefore diaphragmatic blood flow. Importantly, endothelial-dependent and -
independent vasoreactivity may be improved by activation of the transcription factor, nuclear factor erythroid-
2–related factor 2 (Nrf2). However, the role of Nrf2 in improving coronary and diaphragm vascular function in
PH has never been determined. Therefore, our global hypothesis is that exercise training and
pharmacological Nrf2 activation will improve or restore coronary and diaphragm vascular function in
PH. Furthermore, we will assess the reliance upon Nrf2 for these adaptations in order to determine the
potential molecular basis for our findings.
This project will be completed at Kansas State University (KSU) under the guidance of Drs. David C. Poole
and Bradley J. Behnke. The training plan has been formulated to facilitate the development of technical
proficiencies and critical thinking skills needed to execute the proposed experiments and incorporates the
elements essential for the applicant to transition into an independent scientific career. The Poole and Behnke
Laboratories, and the Departments of Kinesiology and Anatomy and Physiology at KSU represent a rich
scientific environment that will provide outstanding graduate training and research opportunities to gain new
insights into mechanisms of diaphragm blood flow regulation and vasomotor control in healthy and diseased
animal models."
10750260,"ABSTRACT
Over 8 million Americans carry a diagnosis of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which is associated with a
significant risk for functional disability, cardiovascular events, and death. Furthermore, the risk of PAD and
adverse outcomes related to PAD, including amputations, are greater among minority groups. It is well known
that physical activity, such as walking, can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause
mortality among vascular patients. For patients with PAD who experience claudication (pain with walking), PAD
management should include regular exercise such as walking. Despite guideline recommendations for center-
based exercise programs, few facilities offer such programs. Among those that offer center-based programs,
patients experience significant barriers to attendance. Developing effective and accessible interventions to
promote physical activity among patients, including Veterans who have high PAD rates, is warranted.
 The purpose of this proposed study is to evaluate two delivery methods of home-based walking among
Veterans with PAD, using an innovative sequential multiple assignments, randomized trial (SMART) design to
compare a web-based delivered walking program, and a video telehealth delivered walking program versus
usual care among 225 Veterans with PAD in three sites (Birmingham AL, Palo Alto CA, and Denver CO).
Participants will be randomized to 1 of 3 arms; (i) the web-based delivered (WBD) program, (ii) the video
telehealth delivered (VTD) program, or (iii) usual care (UC). All participants, irrespective of study assignment,
will receive 2 in-person visits with an exercise physiologist prior to randomization. After 12-weeks, participants
in the WBD arm who do not respond will be further randomized to receive WBD + VTD or WBD only. At 24-
weeks, participants in the VTD arm who do not respond will be further randomized to receive VTD + WBD or
VTD only. Nonresponse will be defined as a <15% increase in maximal walk distance compared to baseline
(measured with a validated treadmill protocol at 12-weeks). The interventions will then continue for an additional
12-weeks. After the 24-week visit, participants will be followed for an additional 12 weeks to examine longer-
term responses for a total participant study duration of 36-weeks. Visits at baseline, 12-, 24- and 36-weeks
include maximal and pain-free walking distance and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The primary outcome
of interest will be change in maximal walking distance from baseline to 12-weeks. Secondary outcomes include
change in maximal walking distance at 24-, and 36-weeks, and change in pain-free walking distance, and
HRQOL at 12-, 24- and 36-weeks. Primary and secondary outcomes will be measured in all participants.
Impact: This trial will be the first to use a SMART design to compare two delivery methods for a home-based
walking program tailored to Veterans with PAD. With this study, we address a major gap in current knowledge
relating to the effective delivery of home-based walking programs. In addition, the proposal is well aligned with
the VA’s special emphasis area, mission, and strategic goals, which include the evaluation of nonpharmacologic
interventions to promote physical activity and reduce pain."
10875275,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) such as Autism Spectrum Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
Disorder, and Intellectual Disability are a challenging set of conditions with large phenotypic overlap and
predominantly unknown etiology. There is a lack of effective interventional strategies to target the most impairing
aspects of NDDs, owing largely to a lack of knowledge about their underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms.
Deletion of one copy of the 16p11.2 region results in a high penetrance of NDDs in humans, and because it can
be faithfully modeled in mice, this deletion is a favored model for the neurobiological study of NDDs. Mice lacking
one copy of the genomic region orthologous to the human 16p11.2 region (16p DEL) exhibit behavioral
phenotypes with relevance to human NDDs including a male-specific deficit in reward learning. This deficit is
recapitulated when 16p DEL is induced specifically in dopamine receptor D1-expressing medium spiny neurons
(D1+ MSNs) of the striatum, implicating this neuronal population as critical to reward system dysfunction in
NDDs. D1+ MSNs are known to play a critical role in signaling reward and learning action-reward associations,
but little is known about how the function of these cells is altered in NDDs. Here, we propose to use the 16p DEL
model to delineate how D1+ MSNs respond to reward in the context of NDDs. The ability of neurons to respond
to experience and store information is known to require carefully regulated gene expression. During this process
neuronal signals are transduced to the nucleus where molecular mechanisms facilitate the expression of specific
genes whose products in turn alter neuronal function. Disruptions of these molecular mechanisms are strongly
associated with the occurrence of NDDs, and multiple pieces of evidence suggest that the regulation of gene
expression is disrupted in 16p DEL mice. The experiments outlined in this proposal will use state-of-the-art
transgenic animals and analytical techniques to investigate the molecular mechanisms controlling the reward
response of D1+ MSNs in the striatum of 16p DEL mice. In Specific Aim 1, we will characterize gene expression
changes induced by reward in this neuronal population. In Specific Aim 2, reward-dependent histone post-
translational modifications in 16p DEL D1+ MSNs will be characterized. Finally, in Specific Aim 3, we will outline
alterations of calcium signaling in these neurons during a touchscreen operant task. This work promises to reveal
the molecular mechanisms underlying reward system dysfunction in an NDD model, which will provide critical
insight into the reward-related behavioral phenotypes observed throughout the spectrum of NDDs."
10916276,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Associating stimuli in the environment to biologically relevant outcomes, such as reward or threat, is necessary
to survive and foundational to decision making. Given the prevalence of disordered decision making, there is a
pressing need to understand the basic neurobiological mechanisms of associative learning underlying
cue-guided motivation and behavior. The Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) is essential to this behavioral process
through its two main neuronal subtypes: dopamine (DA) and GABA. GABA neurons synapse directly onto local
DA neurons and modulate DA transmission. DA neurons increase activity to cue-reward associations,
modulating firing based on the extent to which reward predicted matches reward expected in a phenomenon
known as reward prediction error (RPE). GABA neurons also increase activity in reward learning and their
signaling contributes to RPE DA dynamics. In contrast, DA neurons are inhibited in aversive contexts while
GABA neurons increase activity. Given VTA GABA’s role in both appetitive and aversive processing, these
neurons may be uniquely engaged to integrate valence in decision making. Understanding the role of these
neurons in multi-valent learning is important, because behavior often takes place in situations of motivational
conflict, where opposing goals (i.e., consuming food and avoiding threats) occur simultaneously, requiring the
appetitive and aversive elements to be weighed and integrated to guide choices. This proposal will make
use of new tools to target, record, and manipulate VTA DA and GABA neurons, to investigate
their functional connectivity (Aim 1) and their roles in valence integration (Aim 2). First, I will
optogenetically inhibit GABA neurons while recording the activity of VTA DA neurons through in vivo fiber
photometry. These experiments will test the hypothesis that the VTA GABA modulates local DA neurons and
this relationship can change with experience. I will also manipulate and record DA and GABA dynamics during
a motivational conflict task in which there are two opposing goals (consuming sucrose and avoiding shock) to
dissect the roles these populations play in valence integration. These studies will test the hypothesis that VTA
DA and GABA neurons produce value and salience signals, respectively, that are collectively necessary to
integrate valence, for dynamic reward seeking."

Transition metal-catalyzed reactions have revolutionized chemical synthesis as applied to the
preparation of bioactive molecules and drug compounds, yet new methods are needed to open new
molecular space and overcome the structural biases that arise from current methods. Earth-abundant
transition metals, by virtue of their increased ionicity in metal–carbon bonding and higher density of
states, offer distinct reactivity as compared to state-of-the-art precious metal catalysts. This proposal
describes a new approach to site selective C–H functionalization reactions that leverages the unique
properties of iron, cobalt and manganese to predictably distinguish subtle differences in the properties
of C–H bonds to achieve complementary selectivity to existing methods. By establishing and
articulating the general principles of this approach, these methods will enable retrosynthetic analyses
that will translate to rational design of new molecules outside the reach of current metal-catalyzed
reactions. Specifically, methods for the meta-selective functionalization of arenes are proposed as are
new routes for the selective elaboration of heterocycles that are commonly found in lead compounds. In
addition, methods are proposed to synthesize 1,3,5-trisubstiuted arene derivatives, a valuable structural
type that is been historically underexplored in drug discovery campaigns. Methods for the
chemoselective functionalization of C(sp3)–H bonds in the presence of C(sp2)–H sites are also
proposed that rely on the unique electronic properties of first-row transition metals supported by readily
prepared and modular redox-active ligands."

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) regenerate all blood and immune cells throughout life. Aging HSCs exhibit
diminished regenerative function, reduced lymphoid potential, and clonal outgrowth that is associated with
compromised immunity as well as an increased incidence of anemia, bone marrow failure, and hematological
malignancies in older adults. The regulation of protein homeostasis (proteostasis) has recently emerged as a
fundamental process required to promote HSC self-renewal. Loss of proteostasis is considered one of the
hallmarks of aging, but to what extent it contributes to stem cell aging is largely unknown. An essential pathway
in maintaining proteostasis is the Heat Shock Response, which is regulated by the master transcription factor
Heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1). Hsf1 induces expression of heat shock proteins that aid in proper protein folding,
trafficking, and degradation. At steady state, Hsf1 is typically sequestered in the cytoplasm, but translocates into
the nucleus in response to cellular and proteotoxic stress. Previously, we demonstrated that HSCs undergo
cellular stress when cultured ex vivo and Hsf1 activation can alleviate this stress to maintain HSC regenerative
activity. Hsf1 is highly expressed in young and old adult HSCs but is specifically activated during aging in middle-
aged and old adult HSCs. Aging is a notably stressful process associated with the accumulation of genetic
mutations, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Based on these preliminary results, the central hypothesis of this
proposal is that Hsf1 activation promotes HSC function and proteostasis during aging. To test this hypothesis,
Aim 1 will examine the role of Hsf1 in aging HSC function and proteostasis using conditional Hsf1 knockout mice.
HSC function will be assessed in competitive transplantation assays and proteostasis will be assessed by
quantifying protein synthesis, proteasome activity, misfolded protein, unfolded protein, and protein aggregate
abundance. I expect that there will be less reconstitution in aged Hsf1-deficient HSCs and more protein
synthesis, misfolded and unfolded proteins, and aggregates. While Hsf1 activation is hypothesized to be
important for HSC function during aging, the mechanism underlying heterochronic Hsf1 activation is unknown.
Preliminary RNA-sequencing results revealed that Transglutaminase 2 (Tgm2), involved in Hsf1 activation, is
significantly upregulated in old adult HSCs. Thus, Aim 2 will examine if age-related Hsf1 activation depends on
Tgm2 upregulation. Hsf1 activation, HSC function, and proteostasis will be assessed in conditional Tgm2
knockout mice. I expect that loss of Tgm2 in aging HSCs will disrupt proteostasis and exhibit an associated
decline in fitness and function due to a decrease in Hsf1 activation. Collectively, these studies will provide deeper
insights into mechanisms that regulate proteostasis during stem cell aging. These findings will uncover new
therapeutic targets to promote HSC fitness during aging."
10916267,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Loss of hearing is a prevalent sensory pathology in the United States that affects over 30 million people. A
significant proportion of deafness is attributed to sensorineural hearing loss, which often involves the damage of
afferent nerve fibers which relay auditory information from the mechanosensitive hair cells of the inner ear to the
brain. The restoration of physiologic hearing would require the regeneration of afferent fibers into the sensory
epithelium of the cochlea, followed by the reinnervation of appropriate hair cell targets. Nerve regeneration
studies in humans and other mammalian models are lacking due to the limited accessibility of the inner ear. The
zebrafish lateral line system, composed of superficial fluid-flow detecting hair cells and afferent nerve fibers,
offers a simple and accessible model of nerve regeneration. In this model, there are likely various paracrine,
juxtacrine, and neuron-autonomous signaling mechanisms working in coordination to guide axon pathfinding and
target selection. Aim 1 of this proposal will determine the molecular cues expressed by target sensory
hair cells to guide reinnervation by regenerating afferent axons of the lateral line. Following transection of
the lateral line nerve, hair cells from the zebrafish will be isolated at multiple timepoints. In these hair cells, the
expression changes of canonical and non-canonical molecular cues that may be used to attract axonal growth
cones will be quantified through transcriptome sequencing. Aim 2 will investigate the neuronal bias for
reinnervation of developmentally related hair cell populations. Although studies suggest that neurons retain
a memory for their original hair cell targets, how this memory is established or maintained is unknown. A
transgenic imaging technique will be used to label and trace clonal populations of regenerating axons following
transection of the lateral line nerve. It is hypothesized that neurons prefer reinnervating hair cells that arose from
a shared sensory placode during development. Aim 3 will reveal changes in the local physical environment
of the regenerating nerve to allow entry of individual afferent fibers into their target organ. By imaging
transgenic fish with fluorescently labeled Schwann cells and collagen, changes will be shown in Schwann cell
tracts and the epithelial basement membrane to permit entry of individual axons into the zebrafish neuromast,
which contains target hair cells. It is hypothesized that physical gaps form in Schwann cell and basement
membrane layers in close proximity to denervated hair cells to allow passage of regenerating axons branching
off the main nerve bundle. Together, these studies will elucidate the mechanisms governing afferent nerve
regeneration and the reinnervation of hair cells, which may provide insight towards restoring hearing in the
deafened human cochlea. These studies will be carried out under the direct mentorship of Dr. A. J. Hudspeth at
The Rockefeller University and within the supportive environment of the Tri-Institutional MD-PhD Program in
New York City."

The demand for pediatric clinical pharmacologists continues to grow, necessitating investment in career
development programs to train the next generation of pediatric clinical pharmacologists. This new K12
application seeks to establish the “National Career Development Program for Researchers in Pediatric Clinical
Pharmacology.” This program will combine faculty expertise, pediatric clinical pharmacology research programs,
and clinical research resources from a nationally dispersed group of leading academic institutions. The goal for
this national career development program is to enhance the existing training opportunities through the Eunice
Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Pediatric Clinical and
Developmental Pharmacology Training Network (PCDPTN). Program faculty are grouped into three areas of
subject matter expertise: 1) Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Trials, 2) Pharmacoepidemiology
and Data Science, and 3) Translational Research. The program faculty are selected based on their outstanding
research accomplishments and track record mentoring junior investigators. In addition, the proposed career
development program will leverage resources provided by the Pediatric Trials Network (PTN), the Maternal and
Pediatric Precision in Therapeutics (MPRINT) Hub, and other NICHD-sponsored programs. The participating
institutions have outstanding research environments and a reputation for successful mentorship of junior faculty
pursuing academic careers in pediatric clinical pharmacology. Each scholar will complete a research project
within one of the theme areas for the career development program, and they will be matched with a primary
research mentor and a faculty mentoring committee. Scholars will be able to leverage faculty expertise across
the participating institutions for research and mentoring. In addition to the research project, scholars will complete
professional development opportunities, including training and mentorship in pediatric clinical pharmacology,
written and oral communication, methods for enhancing research reproducibility, and research ethics. An Internal
Advisory Board comprised of experts in pediatric clinical pharmacology will help with scholar selection,
developing strategic partnerships, and advising on program enhancements. In addition, an External Advisory
Board composed of experts in pediatric and maternal pharmacology and with extensive experience mentoring
junior faculty will meet annually with scholars and the Executive Committee and provide advice on the structure
and future directions for the program. The program will be evaluated by the External Advisory Board and through
scholar and mentor evaluations. This career development program will enable scholars to generate the
publication record, preliminary data, and skill set that is necessary to be competitive for independent research
grants. Following completion of the program, all scholars will be exceptionally well-positioned to pursue impactful
careers focused on promoting the safe and effective use of medications in children."
10908670,"Clinical evidence of persistent, large, and increasing mortality gaps between Non-Hispanic Black and other
women in the United States, along with patient surveys and personal stories leave no doubt that implicit bias
and racism in the health care system contribute significantly to disparate maternal outcomes. Central to
identifying the factors to reduce maternal mortality are interventions for healthcare providers and institutions to
recognize the root causes of racism and bias. Our long-term goal is to make respectful care practices the
standard across the care continuum—pre-conception to 1-year postpartum—to reduce disparities in maternal
outcomes. The overall objective for this application, which is the next step toward attainment in our long-term
goal, is to demonstrate a multifaceted, evidence-based intervention will reduce hospital disparities in maternal
outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that hospitals that implement the multifaceted intervention of training,
incorporating equity in all quality improvement efforts, and partnership building with community-based
organizations will have better maternal health outcomes than hospitals who have implemented remote
asynchronous implicit bias training alone. Our previous studies connect mistreatment, discrimination, and
racism across the care continuum to physical and emotional harm to Black mothers. The rationale that
underlies the proposed research is that reducing inequitable and disrespectful treatment is likely to offer strong
scientific rationale for taking a multifaceted approach to equity work to reduce disparities. Our research
strategy will be to conduct a multi-hospital cluster-randomized controlled trial within 9 Ochsner hospitals
(~1900 staff and 14000 deliveries per year) to compare an interactive multifaceted intervention—implicit bias
training, incorporating equity in all quality improvement, and community partnership building— to a remote
asynchronous training alone intervention. Maternal health will be measured by a composite outcome matched
to ACOG patient safety bundle recommendations, collected centrally through electronic health records, and
patient satisfaction by Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems routinely
collected data. This will enable us to achieve the following Aims: 1) Determine the effect of a multifaceted
respectful maternity care intervention on hospital maternal outcome and patient satisfaction disparities; 2)
Determine the effect of a multifaceted respectful maternity care intervention on provider bias; 3) Examine how
a respectful maternity care and implicit bias intervention among impacts patient and hospital staff satisfaction.
These results are expected to have an important positive impact because they will provide strong evidence-
based proof of principle that, by bringing together existing approaches for addressing biased treatment and
care, maternal outcome disparities are reduced."
10908671,"In Louisiana, those living in parishes that lack access to maternal care, referred to as “maternity care deserts”
experience a 91% increase in risk of death during pregnancy and up to 1 year postpartum. Black women are
already at higher risk independent of their residential status, and counties with larger numbers of non-Hispanic
Black women have higher odds of losing all hospital obstetric services. As obstetric care in these largely rural
parishes is unlikely, there is a critical need to develop interventions that will improve maternal health care in
these areas. The overall objective of this application is to examine the potential of enhanced remote care to
improve maternal health. The overall hypothesis is that innovative models of care, based in community
priorities and context, can mitigate the lack of high-level services located in these areas. When patients live far
from care sites, remote care has obvious advantages, reducing the need for long trips, limiting unnecessary
care, and identifying problems earlier. Ochsner’s Connected MOM program (at-home blood pressure and
weight monitoring) has been successfully implemented in southern Louisiana and been associated with a
reduction in preterm birth. However, Black and rural women were less likely to benefit from the program that
white and urban women. The project will be conducted in two phases: In the formative phase (years 1-2), the
project goal is to establish community needs, relationships, and infrastructure to conduct a remote care
intervention (Connected MOM+) that reflects the community’s leadership and priorities. This will be
accomplished by presenting Connected MOM to community groups and determining the service needs,
technological challenges, and barriers to implementation of the intervention, via interviews and focus groups.
Implementation phase project infrastructure, including protocols, manuals of procedures, data collection tools,
provider training, digital infrastructure, and staffing, will then be created. In the implementation phase (years 3-
7), a hybrid effectiveness-implementation stepped-wedge study will be conducted, testing implementation,
process, and health outcomes of the enhanced remote care package across 27 parishes in northern Louisiana.
Access to care, health, and implementation outcomes (reach/adoption/fidelity) will be examined via the
electronic health record system, and patient satisfaction and implementation outcomes
(acceptability/appropriateness) assessed in a sample. This project will have an important positive impact by
improving the health of, and empowering, a high-risk, underserved population."
10908675,"Abstract
Both gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) affect pregnancy, birth
outcomes, and postpartum care. They are independent risk factors for diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension
(HTN), and mental health conditions such as postpartum depression (PPD). Despite recommendations that
postpartum care should include blood pressure (BP), blood glucose (BG) monitoring, and PPD screening,
current postpartum care practices have low screening rates, especially among Medicaid beneficiaries. While
Medicaid covers nearly half of deliveries in the United States, many birthing people lose coverage 60 days
after birth. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 provided states with federal funding to extend postpartum
coverage up to 12 months – Louisiana has done so while Mississippi has not. Additionally, on August 1, 2022,
Louisiana enacted a statewide mandate requiring providers of postnatal care to screen for PPD and related
mental health disorders. Using our collaboration with the National Birth Equity Collaborative and combined
expertise, we propose to evaluate the effects of the Medicaid postpartum extension (MPE) and PPD screening
mandate on screening behaviors, health outcomes, and patient experiences in Louisiana (LA) compared to
Mississippi (MS) over three periods (early 2022-2023, middle 2024-2025, and late 2026-2027). We will link
electronic health records and Medicaid claims data in Louisiana and Mississippi, allowing us to track screening
and follow-up care even after birthing people lose Medicaid coverage. The primary effectiveness measure will
be a 3-month composite screening rate for BP, BG, and PPD. Secondary measures include individual
screening rates, diagnoses, and management of T2DM, HTN, and PPD. It is also critical to understand
contextual factors and health inequities that contribute to disparities in postpartum care and to estimate the
cost-effectiveness of these policies. The overall goal is to evaluate effective implementation strategies that aim
to improve maternal postpartum health in Medicaid beneficiaries with GDM or PIH. To achieve this goal, the
study will have three specific aims. First, we will examine the effectiveness of Louisiana’s MPE and PPD
screening mandate on the rates of BG and BP monitoring, PPD screening, rates of T2DM, HTN, and PPD
diagnoses, T2DM, HTN and PPD management, health disparities, and health care utilization, as compared to
counterparts in Mississippi. The second aim will be to examine the cost-effectiveness and distributional cost-
effectiveness of Louisiana’s MPE and PPD screening mandate from the patient, provider, payer, and social
perspectives. The third aim will be to examine the complex contextual factors that influence adopting and
implementing MPE and PPD screening mandates, and subsequent impacts on healthcare delivery, healthcare
utilization, and maternal health equity within and between Louisiana and Mississippi. Findings will inform
concurrent and future health policy strategies for informing, engaging, and empowering birthing people to
improve maternal health outcomes and eliminate maternal health disparities in the United States."
10908677,"Black mothers are often excluded from the very research designed to improve their health and health
outcomes, despite the fact that they carry the worst burden of maternal mortality (MM) and severe maternal
morbidity (SMM) in the US and especially the Gulf South. Mistrust rooted in a history of discrimination,
experimentation, and stereotyping contributes to the present-day disparities. It is imperative that the proposed
program incorporate institutions who are embedded within the priority population as partners with the research
and healthcare cores of the Center. This will be accomplished by establishing equitable partnership
agreements that counteract the paternalistic framework of traditional research centers. This project’s primary
community partner–not only in this Core but across the entire Center and its leadership–is the National Birth
Equity Collaborative (NBEC). NBEC is nationally renowned for its unique ability to bridge communication gaps
between healthcare systems and Black birthing people via trainings, research, advocacy, and community-
centered collaborations. By also working with community-based organizations (CBOs) primarily led by and
serving Black women, we will have greater access to the target population, and help build these organizations’
capacity via technical assistance Furthermore, our partnerships with Ochsner Health System and other
healthcare partners will aid in translation of findings and sustainability of programming or potential policy
changes. The long-term goal of this Core is to reduce disparities in MM and SMM by embedding Community
Partners into all facets of the Center’s activities. Crucial to the project’s success is our overall objective to
elevate Black voices by incorporating Black-led Community Partners as equal partners in research- and
training-based efforts. Our overall hypothesis is that effective maternity care and interventions can be achieved
when they are founded on research that is guided and co-led by community organizations who fill the gap in
collaboration between health systems and Black communities. To achieve our objective, we will pursue the
following Specific Aims: 1) Establish equitable partnerships between the CBO, researchers, and healthcare
providers through collaborative research projects and training programs within the Center; 2) Create a
research training laboratory where Community Partners and researchers are learning in partnership and
synergizing their knowledge and experience, assets, and networks to achieve the overall objective; 3) Facilitate
the translation and dissemination of efficacious prevention, treatment, and policy focused on reducing racial
inequities in MM and SMM and the root causes of these disparities. Positioning NBEC as the primary
Community Partner and equal collaborator will not only significantly improve the project’s design,
implementation, and dissemination efforts but will also forge strong and lasting relationships with the target
population that will ultimately result in better healthcare outcomes. Prioritizing capacity building efforts with our
Community Partners will generate sustainable and system-level changes throughout the Gulf South."
10908681,"Despite advances in clinical care for perinatal populations, alarming rates of severe maternal morbidity and
mortality continue to disproportionately impact Black people and other minoritized populations, particularly in
the Gulf South. The need has never been greater for innovative and upstream strategies to mitigate the
persistent and steadily worsening trend of outcomes in maternal and perinatal health, and for those efforts to
be guided by people with lived experience from communities who have been most impacted by the crisis. A
perinatal research workforce with health equity training will have the capacity to identify social determinants of
perinatal health and develop effective and sustainable solutions to reduce health disparities and improve
outcomes. The Southern Center for Maternal Health Equity will be guided by a paradigm rooted in reproductive
justice and birth equity. The overarching objective of the Training component is to develop innovative and
transdisciplinary educational and training opportunities for early career and junior scholars aimed at developing
and strengthening a research workforce that is best positioned to improve maternal health and reduce
maternal morbidity and mortality locally, regionally, and nationally. With a guiding emphasis on addressing root
causes of maternal morbidity and mortality, particularly among Black women in the Gulf South, the overall
proposal and specifically the Training component will support the development of a well-prepared group of
researchers focused on health equity who are drawn from populations both historically underrepresented and
deeply impacted. They will thus be able to carry on the overall objective of the Center, improving maternal
health through testing community-prioritized strategies that improve maternal health, with a strong knowledge
and skills based in the overall research theme of assessing implementation of existing evidence-based
strategies and building the evidence base for novel strategies. The Training Component will foster a cross-
institutional, team science approach rooted in the core Research Projects proposed. Trainees will benefit from
the combined resources of four organizations exceptionally well placed to address issues: Tulane University,
Dillard University, the National Birth Equity Collaborative (NBEC), and Ochsner Health System. The program is
innovative in that it will bring community driven and prioritized input to elevate the voices of Black and other
populations severely impacted by the crisis of perinatal health in the Gulf South. Participation of researchers
from communities most affected will be achieved through the foundation of partners Dillard University, the
oldest HBCU in Louisiana, and NBEC. The program directors from Tulane and Dillard will be assisted by
external advisors in close cooperation with the Community component of the Center. The proposed training
program seeks to directly support trainees to address severe maternal morbidity and mortality."
10914239,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mitral valve prolapse (MVP), identified in 1-3% of the general population, is the most common cardiac valvular
abnormality, with complications that include heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death
(SCD). It has been estimated that the incidence of MVP-related SCD is 0.14% to 1.5% per year, depending on
the clinical characteristics of the population studied. While there have been multiple features identified as
markers of increased risk, left ventricular replacement fibrosis appears to be a consistent finding in Arrhythmic
MVP. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered the
most sensitive and specific modality for assessing the presence and distribution of replacement fibrosis and it
has been strongly associated with increased incidence of arrhythmic events in patients with MVP. Preliminary
investigations from our group suggest that these fibrotic changes may be preceded by a chronic inflammatory
phase and that inflammation and scarring may be part of a continuum of ventricular transformation and directly
associated with arrhythmia development and complexity. We now propose an in-depth characterization of the
relationship between intensity and pattern of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake on hybrid Positron Emission
Tomography (PET)/MRI, arrhythmia burden, severity of MVP and mitral regurgitation (MR). Detailed data
including patients’ baseline characteristics, echocardiographic features, histological and biomarker data,
arrhythmic burden and characterization will be obtained in patients with MVP, mild, moderate and severe MR, in
order to establish the correlation between the disease process in its various stages and the PET/MRI phenotype.
Specifically, in Aim 1 we will establish the inflammatory origin of the 18F-FDG signature in a cohort of patients
with MVP, severe MR and class I/II indications for mitral valve surgery. Histology and serum for biomarker
analysis will be collected at the time of surgery. Patients will additionally undergo a second imaging session with
a novel PET tracer, 68Ga-DOTATATE, more specific for inflammation. In Aim 2, patients with MVP, mild or
moderate MR, and a history of ventricular ectopy, who do not have an indication for surgery, will be enrolled into
a longitudinal observational clinical study. We will perform 18F-FDG PET/MRI imaging, echocardiography, 7-day
event monitoring (PVC burden and complexity) as well as collect circulating biomarkers at baseline and at follow-
up after 24 months. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will assess the impact of MV surgery on myocardial inflammation and
function, by repeating the same assessment as in Aim 2 but 12 months post-surgery to explore associations
between MV surgery and changes in myocardial inflammation. With this comprehensive approach, our ultimate
goal is the creation of a novel platform for the assessment of MVP, particularly as it relates to risk stratification
of ventricular arrhythmias and SCD. We posit that the results of our studies may lead to more accurate imaging-
guided patient management and have the potential to significantly influence current guideline recommendations
for risk stratification assessment, medical therapy, and timing for surgical intervention."
10744778,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Recent work has solidified the concept that astrocytes are critical circuit components that regulate
neuronal activity, particularly synchronous types of activity. However, it remains unclear how astrocytes
encode and integrate neuronal circuit signals to mediate this neuronal synchronization. Moreover, the extent to
which single astrocytes function as individual computational units or operate as a syncytial network is not well
understood. In the proposed research, we aim to address these gaps in knowledge by uncovering both the
mechanisms by which neuronal signals are differentially transmitted to astrocytic networks, and those by which
astrocytes feedback to neuronal networks. We will focus on the two major neurotransmitters in the cerebral
cortex (glutamate and GABA) and one essential neuromodulator, norepinephrine (NE), since astrocytes
express abundant cell-surface, G-protein coupled receptors that are activated by all three of these neuron-
derived signals. We will use both ex vivo cortical slices and in vivo mouse models, and apply optical,
electrophysiological, chemogenetic, and genetic techniques to test astrocytic integration into these signaling
systems. Our goals are three-fold: We will determine 1) the mechanisms by which single astrocytes respond to
subcellular activation of glutamate, GABA, and NE, and how those dynamics shape an astrocytic output, 2) the
spatiotemporal effects on local neuronal and astrocytic networks of these three
neurotransmitters/neuromodulators, and 3) the mechanisms by which astrocytes transmit cortex-wide signals
to neurons. Thus, in each of the three aims, we will probe similar mechanistic questions at progressively wider
neurobiological scales."
10839798,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition impacting 1 in 44 children that is diagnosed based on social
communication challenges and restrictive/repetitive behaviors, including repetitive motor movements. While
social communication differences in autistic individuals have been widely researched, motor skills, particularly
those related to speech production, remain understudied. This gap in the literature is surprising given the growing
evidence that motor differences are some of the earliest to emerge, are a clinically meaningful feature of autism
that underlie many core symptoms, and are correlated with both receptive and expressive language skills. A few
preliminary studies indicate that there are motor-based brain differences related to speech production and
language in autism. These results suggest that the motor act of speech production may play a key role in the
communication challenges observed in autism, however the brain and behavioral bases of speech motor profiles
are currently poorly characterized. We can advance understanding of the underlying speech production motor
differences, and related functional consequences, in autistic individuals through an improved characterization of
the speech motor system and speech and language behaviors. Here, I propose to test the hypothesis that
speech-motor brain regions are less engaged during speech production tasks in autistic compared to
neurotypical (NT) adults, and that this disengagement is related to overall motor, speech, and language skills. I
will recruit 30 NT adults and 45 autistic adults with diverse language profiles for an fMRI study paired with deep
speech behavioral phenotyping. In Aim 1, I will use a novel functional localizer to identify and characterize the
speech production network in each individual participant and compare the networks across groups. In Aim 2, I
will use these individual networks as regions of interest in which to examine brain activation during a language-
relevant speech production task, nonword repetition. As part of Aim 2, I will conduct deep speech and language
phenotyping of the autistic adults, in order to obtain comprehensive profiles of their communication skills. I will
then examine the relationship between the speech production activation during nonword repetition and each
participant’s speech, language, and motor profiles. These aims will produce a novel localizer to characterize the
speech production regions, elucidate speech-motor brain differences between NT and autistic adults, and
provide key insights into the relationship between speech production related motor regions and communication
in autism. Knowledge gained from this project will lead to a better understanding of role of the motor system in
communication in autism across diverse language phenotypes."

 Pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase (PNPO) is a rate-limiting enzyme in converting inactive forms of Vitamin
B6 (VB6) in diet, including pyridoxine and pyridoxamine, to the only active form, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP).
PLP is a cofactor required for the syntheses of dopamine, serotonin and GABA in the brain.
 In humans, PNPO deficiency is known to cause neonatal epileptic encephalopathy (NEE). Mutations in
PNPO have been increasingly reported in NEE patients. Recent studies also identify PNPO as a contributor to
early-onset epilepsies and one of the16 epilepsy genes involved in the common epilepsies. However, due to
the lack of animal models, we know little about the developmental or adult functional impact of PNPO
deficiency at systems, circuit or cellular level (e.g. involvement of GABA, dopamine or serotonin synthesis)
under in vivo conditions. We know little about how mild PNPO deficiency interacts with other genetic defects or
environmental factors (e.g. VB6 in diet) to cause seizures or other conditions.
 We have identified the Drosophila homolog of PNPO and identified a Drosophila mutant (sgll95 flies) with
partial PNPO deficiency. Due to low PNPO activity, they are sensitive to dietary VB6 deficiency. We have since
generated global knock-down as well as knock-in models in which the endogenous wild-type (WT) fly PNPO
was replaced by human mutant PNPO found in patients. Viability during development, lifespan and seizure
phenotype of these flies depend on the specific genetic manipulation as well as availability of VB6 in diet. We
have also found that PNPO deficiency exacerbated other epileptic mutant alleles in flies with significant
synergistic interactions. In Aim 1, we will define specific developmental stages in fly models in which PNPO
deficiency leads to lethality and seizures. In Aim 2, we will define brain specific cell types involved in PNPO-
deficiency-induced lethality and seizures in fly and mouse models. We will test gene-gene interactions (e.g.,
PNPO and other known epilepsy genes). In Aim 3, we will generate and characterize fly and mouse models
that carry human PNPO mutations.

10932440,"PROJECTSUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Lyme disease is an inflammatory disease, transmitted by ticks that are infected with the bacterium Borrelia
bugdorferi. Despite treatment with antibiotics, 10-20% of patients develop post-treatment Lyme disease (PTLD)
that often includes neurocognitive symptoms. The mechanisms underlying this are not well understood. Prior
published and preliminary data from our research group suggests that cognitive performance is impaired in PTLD
and that white matter (WM) changes on functional MRI (fMRI) are part of this process. WM changes are also,
however, associated with better patient-reported outcomes. Thus, WM changes during Lyme disease may be
part of a healing process following injury that comes at a cost to cognition, but more information is needed. In
this study, we will draw upon a unique longitudinal cohort of patients with early Lyme disease and erythema
migrans who will be studied longitudinally for 12 months. Their data will be compared to that of healthy controls
without a history of Lyme disease.
 Our overall objective is to study the underlying mechanism of neurologic symptoms in PTLD. We will test the
overarching hypothesis that WM changes reflect an adaptive response, and these changes predict better
outcomes after treatment of early Lyme disease. To accomplish this goal, we will track WM activity immediately
after initial antibiotic therapy and longitudinally 6 and 12 months later. Functional MRI (fMRI) will be used to
measure WM activity that will be compared to outcomes, which will be measured using clinical scales and
cognitive testing (AIM 1).
 We will also address the underlying neurobiological basis of WM changes by determining whether the myelin
sheath or the underlying axon, both of which comprise WM, are affected in PTLD. To do so, we will use
multimodal neuroimaging measures including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), QSM and 𝜒-separation to
understand axon and myelin integrity and health. A blood plasma marker, neurofilament light chain (NfL), will be
used to quantify axonal injury. These variables will be correlated with cognitive performance, clinical scales, and
blood inflammation markers, which, if successful, would provide simple prognostic indicators. (AIM 2)
 Finally, we will examine inflammatory markers including the chemokine ligand 19 (CCL19), which has been
associated with increased risk of developing PTLD, and Interleukin-6 (IL-6), which plays a role in mediating
inflammation and demyelination. These have not been shown to correspond with central nervous system
markers in Lyme disease thus far, but they may correspond with MRI WM values, which has never been tested.
(AIM 3). Collectively, our studies represent a rigorous approach by including multimodal neuroimaging combined
with blood biomarker measurement towards elucidating determinants that are associated with the cognitive and
clinical outcomes of PTLD. The long-term goal is to generate insights that may lay the foundation for new
diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic approaches to the cognitive manifestations of PTLD."
10753526,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) is a significant medical problem in the elderly; It not only causes
substantial disability, but is also a regonized risk for falls and increased mortality. The main hemodynamic
mechanism underlying the fall in upright blood pressure (BP) in nOH is an exagerated decrease in venous return
due to splanchnic venous pooling that patients are unable to compensate for because of impaired autonomic
reflexes. Developing therapies that reduce splanchnic capacitance and restore venous return would have the
potential to selectively improve upright BP. However, the only approved treatments for nOH are pressor agents
which do not target the underlying pathophysiology and increase supine BP as much or more than upright BP.
Furthermore, their increase in supine hypertension leads to pressure diuresis and worsening of OH.
 We have developed an automated abdominal binder that uses a novel technological approach to overcome
the limitations of current drug therapy. The device is triggered by an accelerometer that senses the patient's
upright posture and inflates to a sustained a servo-controlled compression pressure of 40 mm Hg. The device
automatically deflates when the patient is seated or supine and, therefore, will not have the negative effect of
supine hypertension inherent to pressor agents. Our preliminary results showed not only that this device acutely
improves orthostatic tolerance and upright BP in nOH patients, but also that it is as effective as midodrine, the
current standard of care. Thus, this device has several potential advantages over current therapy: it targets the
underlying pathophysiology of OH (unrestrained venous pooling), its effects are immediate compared to
medications that usually require about an hour to reach peak effect; it is activated only when standing (it does
not induce or worsen supine hypertension), and it does not rely on patient compliance or caregiver involvement.
 The purpose of this project is to investigate the mechanisms by which the automated abdominal
binder improves upright BP and orthostatic tolerance in nOH patients, and the effects of abdominal
compression on central hemodynamics and markers of cardiovascular risk. We propose 3 proof-of-
concept clinical mechanistic studies to 1) test the hypothesis that the automated abdominal binder improves
upright BP by decreasing splanchnic capacitance, venous pooling and the orthostatic drop in stroke volume
compared to sham device and midodrine; 2) to determine the acute effects of the automated binder and
midodrine on markers of cardiovascular risk such as augmentation index, pulse wave velocity and central BP,
and 3) to test the hypothesis that the automated abdominal binder will be associated with lower 24-hr supine BP,
reduced diuresis and improved upright BP in the morning after treatement compared to daytime use of midodrine
(10 mg t.i.d). We believe the results of these studies will provide the mechanistic insight to foster the efforts
currently under way to develop a novel therapy for nOH targeting splanchnic capacitance."

Eukaryotic genomes contain arrays of tandemly repeated non-coding sequences that we currently know little
about—satellite DNAs. Typically found near centromeres, telomeres, and on Y chromosomes, satellite DNAs
can comprise over 50% of some eukaryotic genomes. They are known to change rapidly in sequence and
genomic location, which can cause genetic incompatibilities between closely related species. The
misregulation of satellite DNA can have serious consequences for genomic stability and cancer formation.
Despite being a ubiquitous part of genomes and having important effects on cellular functions, the lack of
genetic, genomic, and molecular tools to study tandemly repeated sequences has stymied progress towards
understanding satellite DNA evolution and function. For example, satellite DNAs are particularly challenging to
sequence, assemble, and manipulate. Recent developments in sequencing and genome editing technologies
circumvent some of these problems. This proposal integrates genomic, molecular, and cytological methods to
study the evolutionary and functional genomics of satellite DNA in Drosophila genomes. The PI has developed
new genomic approaches and resources to study satellite DNA evolution with unprecedented resolution. The
PI will use a comparative genomics approach to study changes in satellite DNA sequence, abundance and
organization over evolutionary time and to determine the evolutionary forces driving these changes. This
proposal also aims to develop comprehensive population genetic models of satellite DNA evolution that take
into consideration different types of natural selection based on functional aspects of satellite DNAs studied in
this proposal and leverage empirical data about satellite DNA organization generated by the PI. Little is
currently known of satellite DNA function: the precise genetic manipulation of satellite DNAs with site-specific
gene editing approaches had not been possible in the past due to a lack of unique target sites. The PI has
used their assemblies of satellite loci to identify target sites and has successfully manipulated satellite DNA loci
using CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing techniques. They have made precise genomic deletions and
duplications of satellite DNA in Drosophila melanogaster that they will use to test specific hypotheses about the
regulation, fitness effects, and selfish genetic behavior of satellite DNA. This proposal will also leverage the
new molecular genetic resources the PI created to manipulate satellite DNA expression to ask questions about
their functions in chromosome segregation and chromatin organization. These experiments will have broad
implications not only for genome evolution and speciation, but also for understanding the regulation of satellite
DNA in cancer and aging."
10753528,"Cancer continues to rank as the second leading cause of mortality in the US, with 1.8 million projected new cancer cases in 2020, and 606,520 cancer deaths. The National Academy of Medicine report underscored that 18 or more different clinical disciplines or roles may be involved in patients' comprehensive cancer care. Accordingly, the National Cancer Institute prioritized the need to improve team-based cancer care. The multi-team system (MTS) perspective offers a theoretical framework to examine interdependent work among multiple teams of healthcare professionals (HCPs). To achieve better system performance, MTS theory submits that the system must develop effective communication and coordination. Electronic health records (EHRs) serve a central role in connecting virtual care teams, i.e., groups of HCPS who provide care to the same patients, work at different times and locations, and support their work with technology-mediated communication. Through EH Rs, virtual care teams develop a distributed communication system for encoding, storing, and retrieving patient information, which can be examined as a communication network with individual HCPs representing information agents and communication linkages among them indicating information flow. Understanding this network form of communication and factors influencing its effectiveness will be crucial for the practice of virtual care teams. However, with the explosive growth of EHR data, these ""digital traces"" of complex teamwork interactions provide data of unprecedented size and complexity to study MTSs in their natural healthcare settings. We propose to develop methods for ML-based network analysis of EHR data and visual interpretation of analysis results for understanding and promoting more effective communication and teamwork in cancer care team systems with a focus on studying cancer care MTSs of breast, colorectal, and non-small cell lung cancer patients. Our project uniquely addresses the Transformative Data Science research theme. The interdisciplinary collaboration in our project will offer a diverse basis for creative problem solving and validation. We expect this project will make fundamental contributions to the advancements of visual analytics technology and explainable Al and machine learning for optimizing healthcare processes, specifically making impact to future team-based cancer care."

Glycoconjugate vaccines provide enormous health benefits globally, although they have been less successful in some populations at high risk for developing disease, such as the elderly. In most cases, conjugation of the sugar antigen to the carrier protein has been done empirically with little attention paid to variables critical for the immune response. Recent findings from our lab offer a new and rational explanation for how conjugates work. The new model suggests that carbohydrate presentation to T cells by antigen-presenting cells may strongly enhance the efficacy of antibody responses. Application of this principle in mouse models of group B streptococcal disease and Francisella tularensis infection by using a carrier peptide rather than a protein, resulted in vaccines more protective than standard glycoconjugate vaccines. We have also demonstrated the critical role of the peptide linker and the conjugation site in enhancing both the conjugation efficiency and the immune response to vaccines. The results support the notion that peptide glycoconjugate vaccines provide superior protection against bacterial challenges. Remarkably, the use of a peptide instead of a protein as a carrier confers better protection at much lower levels of carbohydrate specific IgG. This observation challenges the paradigm of a direct correlation between the amount of IgG induced by a glycoconjugate and protection. A comprehensive evaluation of antibodies and immune cells generated by protein vs. peptide glycoconjugates will clarify the features that make peptide vaccines extremely potent. We will evaluate the antibody response to glycopeptide vaccines in terms of IgG subtypes, affinity, avidity and functional activity, and elucidate the costimulatory/coinhibitory molecules being expressed on memory B cells and relate this to the functionality of the antibodies being made. Finally, we will define the interactions between the MHCII antigen presentation molecule and the helper T cell receptor using a proteomic approach. Recombinant TCRs will be used to structurally define the interactions with glycopeptide epitopes. Our approach will identify the characteristics that make glycopeptide-induced antibodies so potent. We will apply our studies of these peptide/polysaccharide conjugates to create more efficacious and longer lasting immunity to glycoconjugate vaccines."
10917281,"Abstract/Summary
Among the Epstein-Barr virus associated cancers is post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD), a rare
but major complication of pediatric solid organ transplants (SOT). Many children are EBV-seronegative at time
of SOT, leading to primary EBV infection from the allograft under intense immunosuppression, and a higher
chance of a chronic high viral load (CHVL) state or PTLD. Longitudinal peripheral blood EBV DNA nucleic acid
testing (NAT) has not improved the individual prediction of PTLD occurrence, likely due to variable SOT recipient
immune responses. Further, these patients receive clinical interventions for EBV DNAemia, with incomplete
responses for unknown reasons. Our team of SOT, infectious disease and immunology professionals will bring
new and complimentary expertise to close these knowledge gaps. We will perform longitudinal T and NK cell
immune function assays in conjunction with local and central EBV and anellovirus NAT in 1390 samples across
5 time points in the first year after 278 SOT (kidney, liver, heart, lung or intestine) at 3 major children's hospitals.
We will accomplish the following Specific Aims, comparing thoracic and abdominal SOT recipients with primary
EBV infection or CHVL state: 1. Assess the prospective phenotypic and functional features of T cell
“exhaustion” and correlate with EBV infection outcomes and NK cell profile. Hypothesis: SOT recipients'
that develop CHVL state display distinct phenotypic memory differentiation and exhausted CD8+ and CD4+ T
cell profiles that are regulated by distinct inflammatory circuits. We will accomplish this aim by performing multi-
spectral flow cytometry to characterize T cell phenotype and function, as well as Meso Scale Discovery platform
to assess distinct viral control-relevant plasma cytokines/chemokines, during the phases of initial replication,
expansion, progression, CHVL or recovery states. 2. To prospectively define the number, phenotype, and
functional status of NK cells, and correlate with EBV infection outcomes. Hypothesis: NK cell activation
will coincide with primary infection, and will correlate positively with clearance vs. negatively with persistent EBV
replication. NK cell dysfunction will develop in patients with CHVL, who are at highest risk of PTLD. We will
leverage our established multi-spectral flow cytometry panel and analyze patients with primary EBV infection
after SOT and answer questions related to the activation status, NK receptor repertoire, and functional capacity.
3. Determine the association of peripheral blood torquetenovirus (TTV) DNA loads to EBV outcomes, T
and NK cell profiles. Hypothesis: TTV loads reduce with clinical reductions in immunosuppression and predict
EBV clearance. We will accomplish this aim using longitudinal whole blood NAT assays for both viruses at
common time points, performed centrally to minimize lab variability. By study end, we will know the T and NK
immune responses to EBV across multiple clinical situations. We expect to find key immune mechanisms that
will predict poor or delayed EBV clearance despite clinical interventions, which may lead to new translational
immunotherapy approaches to prevent PTLD, or inform EBV oncogenesis in other populations."

Dental caries, or tooth decay, is a highly prevalent chronic disease afflicting a significant proportion of the U.S.
population, including a majority of youth and adults. Health disparities in oral health have persisted for decades,
with lower-income youth, Black/African Americans and Latinx minorities being especially at risk for dental caries.
Although adolescence is an ideal time to implement healthy behavioral habits that will be sustained into
adulthood, there is a dearth of effective dental health programs for at-risk adolescents. Research has shown that
primary oral health promotion strategies during adolescence include improving dental health behaviors,
abstaining from tobacco use and vaping, and reducing sugar consumption. Following these recommendations
and informed by our formative research findings, our proposed digital dental program for adolescents will target
three oral health behavior domains: twice-daily tooth brushing with fluoride toothpaste, abstaining from tobacco
use, including vaping, and reducing consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages. Grounded in the Theory of
Planned Behavior, augmented by the Prototype/Willingness Model for adolescents, the proposed cross-platform
digital program will target theoretically based mechanisms to promote these three targeted oral health behaviors.
It will include engaging video and interactive game components. Thus, in this UG3/UH3 application, we will
develop and evaluate a theoretically based digital dental health promotion program designed to engage lower
income Black/African Americans, Latinx/Hispanic, and white non-Hispanic 7th and 8th grade students. In the UG3
phase, we propose to conduct formative work to iteratively develop a school-based, web-based oral health
promotion program. In the UH3 phase, we will conduct a clinical randomized control trial (RCT) in schools, to
evaluate “real world” program efficacy. In the RCT, we will assess program acceptability, feasibility, usability,
satisfaction, and engagement, as well as the three primary behavioral and clinical health outcomes. Secondary
outcomes are the theoretically based mechanisms the program targets for behavior change. Seventh and 8th
grade students (N = 2,000) from 40 lower-income schools across multiple states will be randomized to receive
the program intervention or to be on the waitlist (control condition). Participating students will complete
assessments at three time points (baseline, six weeks post-baseline, and six months post-baseline) to evaluate
both short- and long-term program outcomes. If effective, this comprehensive digital behavioral dental health
program would greatly impact public health by decreasing persistent oral health disparities. Delivering the
program via schools will address disparities in access to such programs, as students will access the program
via school internet and school-owned digital devices. A web-based intervention is also easily scalable and can
be widely disseminated at little cost, reaching adolescent populations most at risk for dental caries. The long-
term goal is to facilitate healthy dental habits and related oral health behaviors for adolescents to attain a lifetime
free from preventable oral disease."

Functionally mature beta cells are essential to glucose homeostasis and their loss or dysfunction underlies all
types of diabetes mellitus. In recent years, it has become clear that not all beta cells are permanently lost in
either type of diabetes. Instead, chronically stressed beta cells lose their functionally mature phenotype and
shift to a dysfunctional state in a process called de-differentiation. Preventing or reversing beta cell de-
differentiation represents a promising approach to restoring functionally mature beta cell mass in diabetics. We
have recently identified five novel genetic regulatory networks that we hypothesize to be important for regulat-
ing mature beta cell function and identity. The overarching goal of this proposal is to establish the above five
regulatory networks as novel genetic and pharmacological switches for controlling beta cell function and identi-
ty. In Aim 1, we will map in detail each of the networks by determining direct and indirect regulated nodes for
each regulator. We will further identify the networks' cellular function and find upstream signaling pathways
predicted to affect the networks' behavior in both human and mouse beta cells, and their points of perturbation
during beta cell de-differentiation. In Aim 2, we will test the causality of the five predicted regulators on beta cell
function and identity in vitro in primary mouse and human islets, and in vivo, using genetic mouse models
where available. We will further test the effect of genetic intervention points in the networks to lock in place ma-
ture beta cell identity under the different diabetogenic stresses."

Small animal models of human disease have provided important insights into renal pathophysiological processes
and are an important preclinical resource to test therapeutic and preventive approaches in acute kidney injury
(AKI). The specific aims of the Pre-Clinical Core (Core B) are to:
Aim 1. Provide the facilities and skills (Animal Models Resource) to study murine models of AKI.
Aim 2. Provide unique facilities and requisite skills (Renal Physiology Resource) to determine renal
 physiological changes in AKI.
This Core will specifically share specialized knowledge, tools, technologies and expertise to (i) utilize rodent
models of AKI specifically in the setting of ischemia/reperfusion injury, sepsis and kidney transplantation, and (ii)
provide expertise and training for studying renal function on the whole kidney and at the single nephron level,
including micropuncture techniques and determination of GFR, microanalysis of tubular fluid and tubular
reabsorption, renal hemodynamics with assessment of tubuloglomerular feedback, and metabolic assessment
of kidney oxygen consumption in rodents. Core B will also provide technical expertise for the isolation of primary
tubular and vascular cells from rodents. The mission of Core B is to provide these unique and relevant resources
within the O'Brien Kidney Consortium to help investigators overcome barriers to utilization of relevant rodent
models for in vivo and in vitro studies (kidney cells and cell lines) to advance understanding of the
pathophysiology of AKI. The Core will capitalize on the excellent, established track record of supporting the
national kidney research community through provision of state-of-the-art tools to investigate AKI in animal
models. Since the inception of the O'Brien Center, Core B has performed more than 20,000 procedures for the
community. The hands-on, technically challenging experimental resources, along with the unique expertise of
Core B personnel, will integrate into the Consortium to catalyze collaborative activities and advance AKI research
for the kidney research community. These resources have been designed to enhance skills and diversity of the
workforce by enticing and supporting early-stage investigators as well as established investigators in other fields
of study into AKI-related research."

investigators and provide them with resources that facilitate discovery, translation and implementation science
to impact bedside care, improve policy and dismantle health inequalities. The overarching objective of the
Resource Development Core is to incubate novel and strategic approaches to continuously support AKI
research across a diverse universe of investigators in the O'Brien Kidney Consortium. This Core will provide a
dynamic resource and platform to develop, test and refine innovations that could accelerate pre-clinical and
clinical research and then can be offered as part of the Biomedical Resource Cores. The initial focus of this
Core will be centered in advanced and quantitative AKI biological characterization and big data analyses. In the
pre-clinical area, novel analytical approaches in metabolomics and molecular and functional in vivo imaging will
be incubated to probe unique biological characteristics of disease development. In the clinical area, tools for
multi-institutional Electronic Health Record (EHR) data management and harmonization and a novel federated
learning platform to evaluate Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based tools will be developed. These development areas
will be frequently evaluated to assure that the selected tools to be refined or developed are relevant to patients
and investigators, and use the most advanced technologies to maintain high standards of validation,
reproducibility and transferability tailoring the growing investigator's needs with a pathway to be offered in the
Biomedical Cores in the future. To continue to drive innovations in AKI research, the following Specific Aims
are proposed. In Aim 1, we will develop an incubator for novel technologies to support pre-clinical research in
AKI. Specifically, in Aim 1A, we will develop tools for the examination of the disturbed distribution of small
molecules and peptides in AKI. We will develop novel microfluidic methods aimed at high resolution molecular
cartography in kidney tissue. In Aim 1B, we will develop molecular and functional kidney-specific imaging and
image-analysis approaches in pre-clinical animal models of AKI. Probing for longitudinal evaluations of tissue-
scale biological changes with translational positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) will elucidate key molecular, functional, and anatomical alterations during AKI development and
in response to novel therapeutics. In Aim 2, we will develop an incubator for digital workspace technologies to
support EHR data analyses in AKI. This will include enhancements in existing collaborative digital workspaces
to support EHR data management and harmonization (Aim 2A) and the development of a novel federated multi-
task learning platform to evaluate AI-based tools (Aim 2B). These aims are forward-thinking to enable novel
methodologies to better understand the pathobiology and heterogeneity of AKI."

Psychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD) are complex diseases where negative
stressors increase the likelihood of its onset through epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation (DNAm).
Presently, disease-associated DNAm patterns of MDD have not been fully elucidated. This is in part due to the
reliance of peripheral tissues such as blood, buccal cells, and saliva where it is unknown how DNAm changes
from these tissues might be an accurate reflection of those changes in the brain. As such, there is an urgent
need to provide a comprehensive database that would cross-compare DNAm patterns between the brain and
other peripheral tissues to highlight candidate regions where disease-associated DNAm can be observed. To
this end, our overall goal is to establish a comprehensive epigenomic database where DNAm patterns can be
cross-compared between key brain regions (e.g., the hippocampus, amygdala, and dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex), their neurons and glia components, and peripheral tissues. Our central hypothesis is that disease-
associated DNAm will more likely reside in regions that vary in DNAm between different tissues. Our specific
aims will address the following questions: In Aim 1, DNAm will be evaluated at a genome-wide level and cross-
compared between brain and peripheral tissues to identify regions which have varying DNAm between tissues.
In Aim 2, we will expand DNAm assessment in neuron and glia to the aforementioned key brain regions
involved in MDD and compare that with peripheral tissues. In Aim 3, disease-associated DNAm regions will be
evaluated using pathology-archived brain tissues from 206 MDD cases and 206 matched controls. This is the
largest post-mortem study of MDD that specifically evaluates DNAm. Disease-associated DNAm will be
overlaid with tissue-specific DNAm to determine regions where MDD-associated DNAm patterns will likely to
occur. This proposed study is significant as it will provide a comprehensive epigenetic database that will guide
researchers to candidate regions and suitable peripheral tissues to investigate DNAm changes in MDD. Its use
may also be extended to other psychiatric disorders. This proposed study is innovative as it uses fresh brain,
neuron, glia and peripheral tissues from the same individual to establish an epigenome database. It also uses
disease-associated DNAm identified from a large cohort of post-mortem MDD brains to identify regions that are
“hot-spots” for disease-associated methylation changes."

 Liver cancer is the 6th most common cancer and the 4th most common cause of cancer death in the
world. According to CDC, the incidence rate of liver cancer has doubled over last 20 years, making it the
fastest growing cancer in US. It is estimated that there will be 42,220 new cases and 30,200 death of liver
cancer in 2018. Thus, we are addressing an increasing health problem in US. Although liver resection is
curative, the lack of adjuvant therapy becomes a critical barrier to the success of surgery, resulting in ~70%
5yr recurrence rate. Thus, novel therapies are urgently needed and immunotherapy has a great potential.
Majority (80-90%) of liver cancer is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which re-express alpha fetoprotein (AFP).
Engineering patient’s autologous T cells with AFP epitope-specific T cell receptor (TCR) genes offers a specific
immunotherapy for HCC. Currently, one AFP158-specific high-affinity TCR just got approved for clinical trial in
May of 2017. But, high-affinity TCRs may cause severe on- and off-target toxicity. We reason that it will require
a panel of TCRs with different affinity to find the optimal TCRs that enable human T cells to kill HCC tumor
cells without toxicity. Thus, we propose to identify multiple AFP-specific TCRs and test their antitumor efficacy
and toxicity. We hypothesize that an effective in vivo immunization strategy will induce potent human AFP
(hAFP)-specific CD8 response with diverse TCR repertoire in HLA-A2 mice. This large number of CD8 cells
enables us to directly study their antitumor function and identify a panel of TCRs with different affinity,
increasing the chance of finding the optimal TCRs to create TCR-Ts of potent antitumor effect without toxicity.
To test this hypothesis, we have developed a concrete research strategy with three specific aims. A1: Identify
hAFP158-specific TCRs to create TCR-Ts of different functional avidity; A2: Identify the hAFP158-specific TCRs
without or with minimal cross-reactivity; and A3: Create expandable and removable TCR-Ts with stemness to
achieve potent in vivo antitumor effect. The goals are to obtain the optimal TCR genes that can engineer
primary human T cells to become effective TCR-Ts capable of killing human HCC cells without harming normal
cells and to establish protocol for generating safe and effective TCR-Ts that are ready for clinical trials. In the
end, applications for an investigative new drug and clinical trial will be filed. This will eventually lead to new
therapeutic approach for HCC. In addition, the methodical approach of creating AFP-specific TCR library and
identifying optimal TCRs with potent antitumor effect and no toxicity will serve as a platform for other antigens
and HLA haplotypes, which will greatly impact the field of tumor immunotherapy."

 Solitary Fibrous Tumors (SFTs) are a mesenchymal tumor type that affects an estimated 10,000
Americans each year. 10-20% of these tumors become malignant and unresponsive to treatments. The
pathogenesis of SFTs is currently unknown, as there are no recurring mutations in known tumor suppressors
genes or oncogenes. The only recurring mutation identified in SFTs is a gene fusion between NAB2-STAT6 that
results in a fusion protein. NAB2 and STAT6 are both transcription regulators. NAB2 is repressor of early growth
response transcription factors (EGR1/2) and STAT6 is an activator of transcriptional programs in response to
cytokines. Both proteins also contribute to enhancer activation. Despite both proteins' known functions, how
NAB2-STAT6 affects gene expression in SFTs is unknown.
 Using the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of a large microarray data set of SFTs we have found
that the expression of both NAB2 and EGR1 targets were significantly upregulated in SFTs. However, the
expression of STAT6 targets was unchanged. We expressed NAB2-STAT6 and performed ChIP-seq analysis
and found that NAB2-STAT6 localizes to distal active transcriptional enhancers. Lastly, we analyzed RNA-seq
and saw that almost 2000 genes were differentially expressed in Malignant tumors vs Benign tumors including
several genes, which are regulated by well characterized transcriptional enhancers. We hypothesize that NAB2-
STAT6 aberrantly activates EGR1 targets to increase proliferation and highjacks the activity of transcriptional
enhancers to promote malignancy.
 We have generated the intra-chromosomal inversion responsible for NAB2-STAT6 expression in the
benign lung fibroblast IMR90 cell line, which replicates the mesenchymal origin of SFTs using CRISPR-Cas9. In
Aim 1 we will establish NAB2-STAT6’s role in directing aberrant gene expression. We will characterize the
genomic binding profile of NAB2-STAT6 as well as its effect on gene expression and proliferation. In Aim 2 we
will investigate the ability of NAB2-STAT6 to reprogram transcriptional enhancers to promote malignancy. First,
we will develop an inducible NAB2-STAT6 system to measure the ability of NAB2-STAT6 to reprogram
transcriptional enhancers. Then, we will validate our results in primary SFTs and examine differences in
malignant vs benign tumors. Finally, we will examine the ability of transcriptional enhancer changes to affect
gene expression through analysis of RNA-seq of primary SFTs. Overall, these aims will establish the function of
NAB2-STAT6 in promoting tumorigenesis in SFTs"
10746440,"Nanoparticles (NPs) have mostly been used as delivery vehicles for various biomedical applications. When
exposed to biological fluids NPs interact with proteins forming a biological coating on their surface, termed protein
corona. Protein corona around NPs have been investigated to address the biological responses including
biodistribution, clearance and potential toxicity of NP. Previously, we along with others have demonstrated self-
therapeutic property of gold nanoparticles (GNPs). In the current application, exploiting self-therapeutic GNP
(ST-GNP) as a probe, we are proposing a unique concept of capturing, identifying and validating therapeutic
targets responsible for tumor growth and therapy resistance in cancer.
 We demonstrated that ST-GNP inhibited functions of a number of tumor-promoting heparin-binding
growth factors (HB-GFs) via binding through the HB-domain that altered protein conformations, whereas
conformations and functions of non-HB-GFs remained unaltered. In addition, among various sizes, GNP of 20
nm size demonstrated highest therapeutic efficacy whereas GNP of 100 nm size was non self-therapeutic (NST-
GNP). Importantly, ST-GNP inhibited tumor growth, metastasis and sensitized ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin
by reversing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and abrogating MAPK-signaling (Fig 1) In orthotopic
model of pancreatic cancer, we reported that ST-GNP disrupted cross-talk between cancer cells and cancer
associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and reprogrammed tumor microenvironment that inhibited tumor growth.
Investigating protein enrichment on ST-GNP from ovarian cancer or normal cellular lysates, we identified
SMNDC1 and PPA1, as potential new targets for tumor growth. Furthermore, we recently reported that non-toxic
Auroliposome enhanced silencing efficacy of siRNA and more effectively inhibited ovarian tumor growth
compared to traditional DOTAP-DOPE based liposomal delivery of siRNA. Based on these results, we
hypothesize that functions of the proteins enriched on ST-GNP will be inhibited resulting in tumor growth
inhibition and therapy resistance. Therefore, these ST-GNP-enriched proteins may serve as potential therapeutic
targets. We will use specific aims below to test our hypothesis;
Specific aim 1: Investigating protein enrichment on ST-GNP.
Specific aim 2: Validating therapeutic targets in animal models.
Impact: Protein corona around NPs is evolving as a unique signature for personalized medicine. Our findings
support that the ST-GNP could be utilized to identify therapeutic targets not only for ovarian and pancreatic
cancer but in diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration and rheumatoid arthritis as well where others have
reported ST property of GNP to inhibit angiogenesis in these models."

Debaryomyces hansenii is a fungal member of the gut microbiome and is present within inflamed regions of the
intestine in Crohn Disease patients. Patient-derived strains of D. hansenii prolong wound healing in mouse
chemical and mechanical intestinal injury models. Mechanisms of pathogenicity of D. hansenii are not well
understood, though macrophages are a key effector cell type in the delayed wound healing phenotype. The
objective of the proposed work is to define mechanisms of innate host response to D. hansenii using in
vitro macrophage models and define microbial mechanisms of impaired wound repair using in vivo
models of intestinal injury. Our preliminary data visualizing phagocytosed D. hansenii with transmission
electron microscopy and cytological staining demonstrate certain macrophages phagocytose and are unable to
clear D. hansenii. Macrophages that do not clear D. hansenii also do not produce TNF-α in response to D.
hansenii. In aim 1, I test the hypothesis that TNF-α supports macrophages clearance of phagocytosed D.
hansenii and identify the pattern recognition receptors responsible for TNF-α production. In aim 2, I examine
microbial morphologic-transitions as an immune evasion mechanism in vitro and in vivo. My preliminary data
suggest that vegetative D. hansenii yeast induce more potent pro-inflammatory cytokine production than spores
of D. hansenii, and spores persist within macrophage cell lines in vitro. This project will define microbial
mechanisms that permit D. hansenii persistence within the intestine and antagonism of injury repair. Successful
completion of these aims will define mechanisms of host-response to D. hansenii and microbial-evasion of
macrophage clearance that will lead the identification of novel therapeutic targets for treating the subset of Crohn
Disease patients with tissue associated D. hansenii."

The purpose of this grant submission is to request funds to partially support the 2023 Annual Colorado
Immunology and Microbiology Conference (CIMC). This will be the 22nd meeting of this conference, which has
been highly successful since it was first held in 2000. The meeting will be held the Steamboat Grand Hotel in
Steamboat Springs, CO on August 30th – September 1st, 2023. The Chairs for the 2023 meeting will be Drs. Kelly
Doran and Roberta Pelanda who will organize the meeting along with additional members of the organizing
committee:
Drs.
David Beckham, Jena Guthmiller, and James Scott-Brown. CIMC program encompasses a wide
range of exciting topics in Immunology and Microbiology. Topics will include cancer immunology, diabetes,
autoimmunity, respiratory immunology, microbial pathogenesis, host-pathogen interactions, inflammation, and
therapeutics. The overall goal of the CIMC is to bring the world's leading scientists and the most promising young
investigators and trainees together in a collegial and supportive environment. The specific goals are to: 1) provide
a forum for the presentation of unpublished, cutting-edge research on Immunology and Microbiology and foster
formal and informal discussions on how these results advance the field, 2) include investigators and clinicians
focusing on diverse topics and define the impact on human disease and health 3) expand the boundaries of the
work of the scientists within this field, and 4) ensure development and integration of young investigators, including
women and those in under-represented groups into the broader research community in a meaningful and
interactive way. The collegial atmosphere will include organized discussion sessions during talks and poster
sessions, and opportunities for informal gatherings in the afternoons and evenings, providing an ideal setting for
scientists from different disciplines to exchange ideas and foster cross-disciplinary collaborations both among
themselves and the next generation of investigators. Thus, the CIMC will provide a unique and fundamentally
important opportunity to bring together leading investigators in a format designed for the free exchange of
research results and ideas covering diverse aspects of Immunology and Microbiology and relationship to disease.
The CIMC will promote diversity, equity and inclusion and the development of promising young investigators in
the field and their integration into the larger research community. In the short term, this will significantly enhance
the ability of investigators to address critical problems in infectious and immune related diseases, while in the
long term it will ensure the continued success of their efforts and those of the next generation of investigators."
11005695,"Project Summary: Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Currently, the only
effective treatment for glaucoma is intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction. Physiologically, IOP is regulated by the
aqueous outflow from the anterior chamber of the eye, with the vast majority leaving through the conventional
outflow pathway. Despite the importance of the conventional outflow pathway, essential questions such as the
relative contribution of the distal pathway to outflow resistance and the factors predisposing regions of the outflow
pathway to be high and low flow remain unknown. Emerging imaging modalities such as optical coherence
tomography, mainly used for retinal imaging, can provide anatomical and functional information that will elucidate
the physiological behavior of the outflow pathway in vivo. Recent evidence using aqueous angiography shows
that flow patterns in the outflow pathway can be used to increase the effectiveness of minimally invasive
glaucoma surgery (MIGS). The PI is an MD/PhD trainee who proposes to utilize the ultrahigh (~1.3 microns in
tissue) axial resolution of visible-light optical coherence tomography (vis-OCT) to noninvasively assess the
physiology of the conventional outflow pathway in vivo. Using the information acquired for OCT, the goal is to
develop noninvasive methods to assess regional flow patterns and improve MIGS. Vis-OCT is capable of
generating three-dimensional volumetric information consisting of both anatomical and functional data.
Additionally, the shorter wavelengths of light used by vis-OCT increase its axial resolution and provides
increased sensitivity to slower blood flow and motion. Since increased resistance in any portion of the outflow
pathway influences outflow, the high resolution of vis-OCT will be used to generate quantitative anatomical and
functional measurements for all parts of the outflow pathway (trabecular meshwork, Schlemm’s canal, and distal
vasculature). Thus, it is hypothesized that anatomical and functional information generated from imaging the
outflow pathway in rodents can serve as biomarkers for understanding the flow patterns within the outflow
pattern. To investigate this hypothesis, the PI proposes two aims: Aim 1 utilizes vis-OCT for anatomical imaging,
measuring Schlemm canal volume and distal vasculature structure to make predictions to discover structural-
function correlates related to regional outflow. Aim 2 focuses on the development of functional metrics, including
the response of the pathway to pharmacological interventions and motion of the trabecular meshwork in
response to intraocular pressure changes, to predict regional outflow. The training environment is well suited for
this investigation, with the mentors' labs being experts in designing OCT systems and the co-mentors lab being
experts in imaging aqueous outflow. This research leverages a diverse group of mentors with expertise in
biophotonics, physiology, biomedical engineering, and clinical medicine. In addition to training the PI to become
an independent researcher, the training plan shall also prepare the PI to become one of the physicians most
knowledgeable in imaging and translating innovative technologies into clinical settings."
10930906,"Abstract
The remodeling of the cervix to prepare for birth begins early in pregnancy and is orchestrated by a precisely
timed change in the structure and mechanical function of the cervical extracellular matrix (ECM). Understanding
the molecular pathways that alter the ECM in pregnancy while maintaining a synthesis and degradation
equilibrium is necessary to discern cervical function and how it mechanically protects the fetus. More importantly,
it is critical to determine when and how these cervical ECM synthesis and degradation processes are perturbed,
which compromise cervical mechanical function and creates a risk for preterm birth. Our groups prior work
provides evidence 1) of rapid collagen turnover rates in both nonpregnant and pregnant cervix 2) dysfunctional
cervical extracellular matrix leads to disrupted cervical biomechanical function in novel mouse models 3) cervical
mechanical properties evolve in distinct stages in concert with shifts in ECM structure and 4) mouse models of
cervical dysfunction are a useful tool to evaluate cervical mechanics. Building on these findings, we aim to better
define molecular pathways of collagen degradation and elastic fiber elastogenesis that ensure ECM homeostasis
in physiologic remodeling. Secondly, we aim to understand the complexity of mechanical parameters derived
from collagen and elastic fibers at multiple length scales. Collectively, the proposed studies, based on compelling
preliminary data, can expand our understanding of basic mechanisms in cervical biology and mechanobiology
and expand the possibilities for clinical intervention in PTB."
10930832,"Project Summary and Abstract
 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia diagnosed through the presence of tau
tangles and amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques within the brain. Aβ is generated from amyloid precursor protein (APP),
an integral membrane protein. APP and Aβ localize to mitochondria and mitochondrial associated membranes
(MAMs). MAMs are endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria contact sites and are associated with altered
function of both the ER and mitochondria. Previous studies have shown that MAM activity directly influences
APP processing into Aβ. We hypothesize that localization of APP at mitochondria and MAMs dictates Aβ
production.
 Prior studies indicate APP localization at the mitochondria, ER, and MAMs affects their function, but an
overall mechanism is not understood. Mitochondrial and ER dysfunction are observed in AD. Impaired
mitochondrial bioenergetics, increased oxidative stress, and altered mitochondrial calcium, cholesterol, and
phospholipid metabolism are evident in models of AD. MAMs are known to modulate these functional
modalities between mitochondria and ER, and upregulation of MAMs is observed in AD. This upregulation of
MAM function is hypothesized to drive APP processing into Aβ and disrupt mitochondrial and ER function.
 We will test our hypothesis in two aims. We will elucidate the effects of APP localization on Aβ
production and evaluate if MAM function influences localization of APP. We will address how APP and Aβ
production interact with MAM function. We will also evaluate AD and cell-type specific changes between these
relationships. Addressing the relationship between MAMs, APP, and Aβ production will provide novel insights
into their roles in AD pathology.
 This F31 award is designed to further Taylor Strope’s career path by complimenting her current training
and developing expertise in new areas. These new areas include genome editing and differentiation of induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), mitochondrial/ER biology, and APP biology. At the University of Kansas Medical
Center (KUMC), Taylor Strope will work with her mentors, Drs. Wilkins and Swerdlow of the Alzheimer’s
Disease Research Center. The expert mentoring team, strong training environment, and research experience
are imperative for advancing Taylor Strope’s academic career goals."
10884207,"Project Summary/Abstract: The development of catalytic reactions to selectively transform ubiquitous
functional groups to value-added products can enable the efficient synthesis of medicinally relevant molecules.
The facile generation of classical reactive intermediates such as radicals, cations, and anions via photoredox
catalysis and proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) have shifted the way chemists construct complex
molecules and enabled novel bond-forming logic. However, the application of these mild photocatalytic manifolds
towards the generation of alkene-derived radical cation intermediates still relies on strongly oxidative conditions
to facilitate alkene oxidation. The ambiphilic nature of alkene radical cation intermediates renders these species
valuable synthetic linchpins capable of rapidly building molecular complexity and streamlining the development
of pharmaceutically relevant molecules. The goal of the proposed research is the development of a novel
synthetic platform for the photocatalytic formation of alkene radical cation intermediates from non-canonical
alcohol starting materials. This proposal seeks to leverage the mechanistic insights gleaned from the intracellular
formation of alkene radical cation intermediates in concert with the capabilities of excited state redox chemistry,
to generate radical cations under synthetically advantageous conditions. The development of this methodology
will address three fundamental limitations of radical cation chemistry: 1) the use of harsh oxidative conditions for
alkene oxidation 2) the constraint of alkenes as radical cation progenitors and 3) the use of oxidatively labile
reaction partners. The research strategy outlines a rigorous approach for establishing a mechanistically distinct
method to access classical alkene-radical cations from non-canonical precursors, and the development of new
synthetic methods outside the scope of conventional radical cation chemistries. In aim 1, we will leverage
established principles of photoredox catalysis for the development of a reductive platform for the catalytic
generation and subsequent functionalization of classical alkene radical cations intermediates from non-canonical
halohydrin precursors. The reductive generation of alkene radical cations will initially be applied to the
development of annulative carbofunctionalizations reactions. This reductive platform will then be expanded to
enable formal access to non-classical vicinal di-cation reactivity which is inaccessible via conventional alkene
radical cation chemistries. In aim 2, C–H PCET will be applied for the selective homolytic activation of strong C–
H bonds of simple alcohols for the direct generation of alkene radical cation intermediates. PCET generated
alkene radical cations will then be applied to the direct generation and functionalization of nucleotide-derived
radical cations for the expedient synthesis of nucleotide analog libraries. This work will provide a novel and
synthetically advantageous approach to the generation of both classical and non-classical reactive intermediates
and result in new synthetic methods that can streamline the synthesis of biologically relevant molecules and
facilitate efforts to improve human health, in line with the NIH’s core values."

Human norovirus (hNoV) and Clostridium difficile (CD) represent two leading causes of acute gastroenteritis
worldwide with significant morbidity and mortality. The two infections (one viral and one bacterial) share many of
the same characteristics of transmission; and concurrent infections are particularly prevalent in the US in high-
risk populations, such as aged patients undergoing antibiotic treatments, hospitalized patients, or patients
staying in long-term care facilities. Despite great efforts in the development of vaccines against both infections,
to date there is still no single vaccine available on the market. We have developed a novel platform technology
against enteric bacterial pathogens by engineering a probiotic yeast, Saccharomyces boulardii, to secrete multi-
specific single-domain (VHH) antibodies, directly targeting bacterial virulence factors at the intestinal site of
infection. We have successfully applied this technology to target Clostridium difficile. The overall objective of this
project is to generate Sb strains secreting mSdAbs against both CD toxins and hNoV, generate proof-of-principle
efficacy data in relevant animal disease models, and develop clinic-compatible formulations for drying and
encapsulating the Sb-mSdAb strains. We hypothesize that oral administration of Sb-mSdAb strains secreting
mSdAb against hNoV and CD toxins will prevent their individual or concurrent infections. To test this hypothesis,
we propose to accomplish the following 3 specific aims: 1) Engineer Sb-mSdAb strains (Sb-aNoVCd) secreting
VHH fusions against both CD toxins and hNoVs. 2) Determine preventive efficacy of Sb-aNoVCd strains against
infections with hNoV and CD in gnotobiotic pigs. 3) Develop a formulation supporting yeast spray drying and
encapsulation. With the completion of proposed translational activities, we will have generated lead Sb-aNoVCd
strains and evaluated in vivo characteristics in mice and in gnotobiotic pigs which is the most appropriate animal
model of hNoV infection and disease. Should the key proof-of-principle efficacy data generated, future scale-up
efforts will be justified to include additional VHHs for generating broadly efficacious lead immunoprophylactic
strains and eventual commercialization of the yeast products against CD and hNoV gastroenteritis for which we
currently have no prophylaxis or vaccines."

The overarching objective of this trial is to test the impact of a full-service mobile food market (“a grocery store
on wheels”) on diet quality, food insecurity (i.e., uncertain or not enough access to food for a healthy life) and
food purchases in underserved communities. We will also explore personal, social, behavioral, and
environmental factors that may influence adoption of mobile market shopping. The long-term goal of our work
is to increase equity in diet/weight-related health outcomes by improving access to and intake of healthy foods.
Currently, individuals from racial/ethnic minority backgrounds and those who experience low incomes are
disproportionately impacted by poor nutrition and diet/weight-related health outcomes such as type 2 diabetes
and high blood pressure. Lack of affordable, healthy food access and food insecurity are believed to be
important contributing factors to these disparities. Mobile food markets have been proposed as a strategy for
mitigating these health disparities because they bring low-cost, healthy food directly to underserved
populations. Mobile food markets are increasingly available nationally and have been supported by state
legislation, but little is known about their effectiveness. Full-service mobile markets may improve multiple
aspects of the diet by providing foods to meet all dietary needs through a convenient one-stop shop. The full-
service mobile market to be tested in this proposal (Twin Cities Mobile Market) sells staple foods from a bus
that regularly visits low-income neighborhoods. Foods are sold at prices 10% below those of grocery stores.
SNAP/EBT is accepted, and a state-funded fruit/vegetable incentive program (Market Bucks) is available to
shoppers. Working in partnership with our community team members, we will enroll 6 community sites
(clusters) in two waves (12 total sites/clusters) and recruit 20 participants per site (N=240). We will collect
baseline data and randomize sites to either receive the full-service mobile market intervention or serve as the
waitlist control. We will then implement the full-service mobile market at intervention sites, follow participants
for one year, and collect follow-up data. After follow-up data collection, waitlist control sites will receive the full-
service mobile market intervention. For Aim 1, changes in diet quality (our primary outcome measured with the
Health Eating Index-2015) and food insecurity (measured with the 18-item U.S. Adult Food Security Survey
Module) will be assessed. For Aim 2, changes in food purchases will be objectively measured by collecting one
month of food purchase receipts at baseline and follow-up data collection. We will also assess mobile market
food purchases during the implementation period with customer loyalty cards. For Aim 3, we will explore the
factors that influence adoption of mobile market shopping. Findings will provide evidence on the effectiveness
of a full-service mobile market to address disparities around diet, food security, and food purchasing outcomes.
This innovative research will provide timely evidence to inform mobile market sustainability, policy, and
legislative decisions."
10749057,"Lower urinary tract symptoms are highly prevalent in adult men and women, with an estimated prevalence of
up to 50%, and can have a significant impact on quality of life. Urodynamic studies (UDS) are routinely
performed in the assessment of lower urinary tract symptoms. Presently, UDS is used in the clinic to detect
detrusor overactivity. Detrusor overactivity is caused by unintentional transient contraction of the bladder
detrusor muscle, increasing the internal pressure in the bladder. Detrusor overactivity is a common problem. It
is estimated that 20% of the total population suffer from overactive bladder, and of those with overactive
bladder who are tested by UDS, 65% have detrusor overactivity. Another application of UDS is to assess
bladder function in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). BPH is a common clinical entity. Millions of
men develop lower urinary tract symptoms and seek treatment for this entity. Surgery to de-obstruct the
urinary tract may be pursued to treat these patients. Clinically, a UDS test includes the use of multiple pressure
catheters (placed in the bladder and rectum/vagina), retrograde bladder filling for an assessment of urinary
storage function, and a pressure-flow study to assess for abnormalities of the voiding phase. UDS is limited by
its invasiveness, patient discomfort, testing artifacts, and the risk of complications. Adverse outcomes,
including urinary retention, catheter trauma, or hematuria, are reported in up to 19% of men and 1.8% of
women. Considering UDS limitations, there is a need for a noninvasive alternative to UDS. To overcome the
limitations of UDS, we propose a noninvasive ultrasound technique, Quantitative Ultrasound Bladder
Vibrometry (QUBV). This technique measures changes in the detrusor’s pressure due to detrusor overactivity.
Since this method does not require catheterization, it does not expose the patients to the risks and discomfort
associated with UDS. Other advantages of QUBV include a direct measure of the detrusor pressure without
the influence of bowl contractions, low cost, and portability. Also, since QUBV is noninvasive and low cost, it is
suitable for repeated longitudinal tests for monitoring and evaluating response to treatment. The goal of this
project is to evaluate the efficacy of QUBV applications in detrusor overactivity and BPH. To achieve our goal,
we propose the following Specific Aims: (1) Evaluate the performance of quantitative ultrasound bladder
vibrometry (QUBV) in diagnosing detrusor overactivity; (2) Prognostically determine and monitor
patients with BPH that may benefit from surgery to de-obstruct the urinary tract. Each Aims will be
tested in a population of patients. Our team has over a decade of experience in developing new technology for
application in urology, thus has the expertise and resources to achieve the goals of this project. Also, the
project benefits from the world-class clinical research and facilities at the Mayo Clinic. Successful completion of
this project may have a significant impact on the diagnosis and management of bladder dysfunction."

In vertebrate animals, the vestibular system (primarily known as the “balance system” of the brain) interprets
head-movement and orientation signals to provide organisms with a sense of self-motion. The vital contribution
of vestibular system to reflexive control of posture, gaze, and gait is well characterized; however, far less is
known about the neural substrates underlying higher-order vestibular functions, such as the perception of self-
motion and the awareness of one's orientation in space. These functions rely on the cortical integration of
vestibular input with somatosensory and visual input. In non-human primates, the parieto-insular vestibular
cortex (PIVC) is uniquely suited to perform this multisensory integration. Unlike other vestibular-sensitive cortical
areas, PIVC has direct access to vestibular, somatosensory, and visual input from the thalamus; indeed, it is
hypothesized that other vestibular cortical areas receive their vestibular input from PIVC, thus making it a nexus
for higher-order vestibular function. Despite its hypothesized importance, extremely little is known about the
neural mechanisms by which PIVC integrates vestibular and extra-vestibular input, and whether this integration
is context dependent. For example, it is unclear whether PIVC neurons differentiate between vestibular input
generated during passive vs. active movements; such differentiation is seen in the vestibular nuclei and thalamus
and is thought to be essential for producing a sense of motor agency. To investigate these issues, I propose to
conduct high-density neurophysiological recordings in behaving primates during both passive stimulation and
actively generated head and whole-body movement. In Aim 1, I will investigate how PIVC integrates passively
applied vestibular and somatosensory input (Aim 1.1) and then vestibular and visual input (Aim 1.2). In Aim 2, I
will investigate whether PIVC differentially processes vestibular input during passive and active movement.
Specifically, I will examine how PIVC processes vestibular input generated during natural self-motion (i.e., self-
motion relying on sensorimotor input in the form of a head-turning task, Aim 2.1). I will then examine how PIVC
processes vestibular input generated during a learned, cognitively demanding motor task (Aim 2.2). In both aims,
I will determine how individual neurons in PIVC encode vestibular and extra-vestibular input, as well as how this
information is represented at the population level. The proposed experiments will resolve two questions which
are fundamental to understanding PIVC function: 1) How does PIVC integrate multisensory input to construct a
percept of self-motion? and 2) Is the processing of self-motion by PIVC neurons consistent with that required to
provide a sense of motor agency? Furthermore, the proposed experiments will determine how sensorimotor and
cognitive percepts of self-motion are represented in PIVC. This research will provide new insights into cortical
vestibular function and how it supports the higher-order processes that allow primates (both human and non-
human) to successfully perceive and navigate their environments."

The tumor suppressor LKB1 is one of the most frequently mutated genes in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). This
tumor subgroup is resistant to immune checkpoint blockade therapy and is not amenable to molecularly targeted
therapies. LUAD with LKB1 mutations is usually smoking-related. Even though females are more susceptible to
smoking-related DNA-adduct formation in the lung, the frequency of LKB1-mutant LUAD is significantly lower in
females than males in multiple large-scale studies. The underlying mechanism is not known primarily because
of the lack of an appropriate model to study this phenomenon. We previously established a genetically
engineered mouse model (GEMM) in FVB/N background, which can form KrasG12D/LKB1null (LUAD) in the lung
with similar features to human LUAD in tumor characteristics and tumor microenvironment. A meta-analysis of
our GEMM model revealed the LUAD formation at 97% in males versus 58% in females. We also established
lung cancer cell lines from our GEMM, and the establishment of lung metastases through tail-vein injection in
syngeneic animals also encountered a strong sex bias in female hosts. Interestingly, this sex bias can also be
observed in immune-compromised mice, such as SCID mice deficient in adaptive immunity. Therefore, we
hypothesize that innate immunity in some female hosts can eliminate LKB1-mutant LUAD. Here, we will (i)
determine why LKB1-mutant LUAD is susceptible to this innate immunity and (ii) which subpopulation of innate
immune cells is responsible for eliminating LKB1-LUAD in some female hosts. The elucidation of this mechanism
should provide novel insights into developing new therapeutic strategies for LKB1-mutant LUAD."

Marijuana smoking and vaping is on the rise in the United States with the increased legalization of recreational
and medical marijuana. The main psychoactive component present in marijuana, and added to vaping
preparations, is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Even though the effect of marijuana smoking on obstructive
lung disease can vary between studies, it is recognized that marijuana smoking is associated with increased
cough, sputum production, and chronic bronchitis often associated with infections, but the mechanism remains
to be determined. Our preliminary data show that chronic exposure of THC alone to primary human bronchial
epithelial cells grown at air-liquid interface alters several components of the mucociliary function (i.e. ion
channels, cilia beating), resulting in increased susceptibility to infections. Environmental pollutants, such as
cigarette smoking, can alter gene expression. Unfortunately, some of the changes can persist despite cessation.
The goal of this study is to determine the effects of THC-containing preparations (marijuana and vaping) on
bronchial epithelium host defenses. This proposal is submitted in response to NOT-DA-20-031 “Transcriptomic,
epigenomic, regulatory RNA or functional genomic research in substance use disorders”. Here, we propose to
(1) determine whether chronic exposures to THC through marijuana smoke or vaping differentially alter the
bronchial epithelium functions involved in host defense against microbial pathogens; and (2) identify the nature
of transcriptomic changes which persist in bronchial epithelium after cessation from exposures to marijuana
smoke or vaping. This comprehensive study will reveal the effects of THC in marijuana smoke and vaping
preparations on airway homeostasis and identify new molecular targets to prevent infections and development
of lung diseases."
10904799,"Germinal centers (GCs) are the microstructural sites in secondary lymphoid organs that control B cell clonal
expansion to produce high-affinity antibodies for achieving humoral immunity. GC structures are impaired in
obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients, leading the deficiencies in immune responses in infected individuals.
The role of B cell development through GC reactions has been well established. B-cell immunometabolism is
crucial to meet the energy needs of rapid proliferation. OSA patients exhibited associations with metabolic
syndrome and vulnerability to flu. However, the coordination of metabolic trajectories in B cells of OSA+ and
OSA- patients is still not clearly understood. There is a critical need to decipher the B cell immunometabolism
at the single cell level in GCs for identifying the metabolic defects in the immune system of OSA patients
making them prone to life-threatening infections. Thus, this project will leverage the recently developed
spatially resolved metabolic profiling framework (3D-SMF) to map B cell subsets and their metabolism in the
tonsil tissues and organoids. Our long-term goal is to generate single cell metabolic insights of B cell
development in GCs of OSA+ and OSA- patients in response to influenza. The goal of this project is to define
spatially resolved B cell immunometabolism pixel-by-pixel in fixed human tissues and living tissues. We
hypothesize that metabolic trajectories and spatial distributions of B-cell subsets will be defective in OSA+
compared to OSA- tissues and influenza response in OSA- tonsil-derived organoids will be more competent
than OSA+ tonsil-derived organoids. The rationale for this hypothesis is based on the 3D-SMF data showing
the depletion and enrichment of fatty acids in GCs located in native tonsil tissues and the recent evidence on
OSA patients’ vulnerability to flu infections associated with metabolic syndrome. The central hypothesis will be
tested by pursuing two specific Aims. Aim 1 will provide an integral understanding of the lipid-associated
immunometabolism in B-cell subsets in human OSA+ and OSA- tonsil tissues (n=10 each) and engineered
tonsil organoids. Aim 2 will define how the metabolic trajectory modeling of B cell subtypes differs in tonsil
organoids exposed to influenza antigens in OSA+ and OSA- donors. To accomplish these Aims, 3D-SMF and
multiplexed cytokine gene expression profiling will be used to analyze B cell immunometabolism through a
pseudotime B cell development modeling and longitudinal metabolic trajectory comparisons of B cell subsets in
biomaterial-based tonsil organoids. This project builds an interdisciplinary team integrating experts from
spatial omics, biomaterials, pediatric OSA, and bioinformatics. The proposed application is innovative
because it uses cutting-edge technology to define spatial metabolomics and proteomics of tonsil organoids and
shifts from the traditional focus on T cell and B cell co-cultures, toward differences of B cell metabolism in
physiologically relevant and dynamic OSA+ and OSA- tonsil organoids ex vivo. This research is significant
because it defines B cell immunometabolism to understand why OSA patients are prone to flu infections."

Pain is a debilitating condition that severely impacts quality of life. Despite a growing need for new treatments,
an incomplete understanding of the neural circuitry underlying pain has limited the development of novel pain
therapeutics. Spinal projection neurons in the superficial dorsal horn channel pain signals from the spinal cord
into the brain. These neurons may represent a viable target for future pain management strategies. While virtually
all the spinal output neurons mediating nociception target the contralateral parabrachial nucleus, subsets of
these neurons also project to other supraspinal structures, such as the ipsilateral parabrachial nucleus (spino-
PBN neurons) or the contralateral periaqueductal gray (spino-PAG neurons). Given the distinct collateralization
patterns of these neurons, I hypothesize that the spino-PBN and spino-PAG neurons have distinct
nociceptive functions. I will test this hypothesis using anatomical (Aim 1), functional (Aim 2), and behavioral
(Aim 3) approaches. Aim 1 will characterize the projection patterns of the spino-PAG and spino-PBN neurons
through retrograde viral tracing, optical clearing, and ribbon scanning confocal microscopy. Aim 2 will determine
the functional response properties of the spino-PAG and spino-PBN neurons using two-photon calcium imaging
and natural stimuli applied to an ex vivo preparation. Aim 3 will uncover the role of the spino-PAG and spino-
PBN neurons in mediating nocifensive behavior using chemogenetics and behavioral assays of nociception. The
experiments described in this proposal have the potential to advance our basic understanding of the spinal output
circuitry mediating nociception and help determine the efficacy of spinal projection neurons as new targets for
clinical intervention. To complete this proposal, I will receive rigorous intellectual and technical training from a
team of expert scientist and clinician mentors. This training will enable me to become an independent
investigator, allowing me to accomplish my long-term goal of becoming a physician-scientist specializing in pain."
10748271,"BACKGROUND: Delivery of evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD)—especially medication
treatment (MOUD)—reduces morbidity and mortality and is the bedrock of OUD care. Yet fewer than half of
Veterans with OUD receive MOUD, and up to half who initiate treatment do not remain in treatment after 12
months. Access to treatment is a barrier that many interventions have addressed in recent years; however,
there is also evidence that many Veterans with access to treatment may not engage in care (i.e., seek care,
pursue treatment, adhere to treatment plan, follow up with a provider). Patient-centered care is a tenet of care
quality that can improve patient engagement but has not been measured for OUD care. Gaps identified in
patient-centered care for OUD could represent targets for quality improvement interventions that increase
patient engagement, improve treatment delivery, and reduce mortality. My study objective is to develop and
implement a quality measurement and quality improvement strategy that will improve patient-centered care for
Veterans with OUD. My long-term goal is to become an independent VA clinician-investigator with a focus on
improving healthcare access and quality for Veterans with OUD and other substance use disorders (SUDs).
SIGNIFICANCE/IMPACT: OUD prevalence, morbidity, and mortality among Veterans are disproportionate to
the general US population. To address this disparity, VA has expanded treatment access, but overall
engagement among affected Veterans remains low. The extent to which patient engagement is affected by the
quality of patient-centered care is not established because there are few quality measures for OUD, and most
are not patient-centric. Instead, current measures may disincentivize patient-centered care by measuring
aspects of care outside the full control of the provider (e.g., treatment initiation, adherence, and retention) and
favor treating patients already committed to recommended care over those who are not. VA has a track record
as a leader in both patient-centered care and SUD care that spans decades, making this study optimal for VA.
INNOVATION: This CDA-2 will measure the quality of patient-centered care through audio-recorded patient
visits (patient-collected audio). It will also incorporate the patient voice in defining a provider feedback
intervention to improve patient-centered care, through direct elicitation of patient preferences and partnership
with a Veteran Advisory Panel.
SPECIFIC AIMS: There are three aims in this study: (1) To assess performance of VA OUD providers on
measures of patient-centered care and the association of patient-centered care performance with patient
engagement; (2) To identify preferences, needs, and values of Veterans with OUD that impact their willingness
to engage in care; and (3) To develop and implement a provider performance audit and feedback intervention
based on patient-centered measures of OUD care quality.
METHODOLOGY: I will use patient-collected audio recordings of 300 OUD-related clinical visits to assess
provider performance on five validated measures of patient-centered care at two VA facilities, followed by chart
review to compare the extent of patient-centered care received to six measures of engagement six months
after initial assessment. Next, I will (a) interview Veterans with OUD regarding their preferences, needs, and
values related to OUD care and (b) survey Veterans with OUD using best-worst scaling to identify preference-
ordered themes that are perceived as likely to increase engagement in care. I will then bring together VA
stakeholders (patients, providers, leaders) using a nominal group technique to (a) review provider performance
and patient preferences related to patient-centered care and patient engagement and (b) develop and
implement a provider feedback intervention to improve patient-centered care for OUD at one VA.
NEXT STEPS/IMPLEMENTATION: I will work with key stakeholders, including Veterans, clinicians, and VA
operational partners, to expand this quality measurement and implementation strategy across VA."

Despite intense research focus, Staphylococcus aureus has remained an important cause of both community
acquired pneumonia and viral-related super-infections. The field has recently determined host mediated
mechanisms induced by S. aureus that drive lung infection and injury. In the context of preceding influenza
infection, our group and many others have delineated aberrant immune pathway regulation as key drivers of S.
aureus susceptibility and pathogenesis. In addition to host mediated interactions, S. aureus expresses a number
of secreted and cell wall virulence factors that have not been fully characterized in pulmonary infection. We
performed a transposon mutant screen of S. aureus cell wall anchored proteins in pulmonary infection and super-
infection in mice. This screen revealed a novel S. aureus virulence factor, SasD, which is required for lung
inflammation, injury, and mortality. SasD was also required for lung epithelial cell attachment and inflammatory
cytokine induction by macrophages. In this application, we hypothesize that S. aureus SasD is a critical virulence
factor in pulmonary infection, which mediates bacterial adherence to the lung stroma and interactions with
primary lung phagocytes. We will test this hypothesis with two independent, but related Aims; 1) investigate the
role of SasD in bacterial adhesion to lung epithelial cells and in vivo growth in the lung, 2) examine the role of
SasD in mediating S. aureus interaction with pulmonary phagocytes and the impact on lung inflammation. We
will determine the context dependent roles of S. aureus SasD in single and influenza super-infection. Further,
we will utilize cutting edge tools to determine these interactions in human and mouse systems. Data generated
in this project will inform upon focusing on S. aureus SasD at a potential therapeutic or vaccine target in
pulmonary infections."

Aspergillus fumigatus is a major human fungal pathogen that infects – often killing – hundreds of thousands each
year. A few closely related species are also pathogenic but cause fewer infections. In contrast, most other closely
related species are not pathogenic. Pathogens have originated repeatedly from non-pathogens, suggesting that
the ability to cause disease or pathogenicity has evolved multiple times independently in this lineage. The
observed spectrum of pathogenicity cannot be explained by differences in species' ecologies or by ascertainment
bias, indicating that the repeated evolution of Aspergillus pathogenicity has, at least partially, a genetic basis.
 Several key traits – and their underlying genes and pathways – are known to be associated with A.
fumigatus pathogenicity, including virulence, growth at the human body temperature, and the production of
secondary metabolites. In contrast, we know surprisingly little about the repeated evolution of pathogenicity in
Aspergillus and the variation in the traits and genetic elements that contributed to its origins. Whether pathogenic
species share traits and genetic elements that are absent in non-pathogens (“conserved pathogenicity” model)
or each pathogen contains a unique suite of traits and genetic elements that distinguish it from its non-pathogenic
relatives (“species-specific pathogenicity” model) remains unknown; a third model, essentially a mix of the other
two, is also possible, under which some traits and genetic elements that contribute to pathogenicity are
conserved and some are species-specific. Elucidating which model explains the repeated evolution of
Aspergillus pathogenicity is key for developing strategies to combat infections, identifying genetic elements that
contribute to virulence, and predicting new pathogen emergence.
 This project will test these models and advance our understanding of the evolution of Aspergillus
pathogenicity by investigating: the variation of species (and strains within species) that span the pathogenicity
spectrum with respect to virulence, growth at the human body temperature, and secondary metabolite production
(Aim 1); the genomic and transcriptomic variation associated with the observed differences in pathogenicity (Aim
2), and; how genetic elements that vary between pathogens and non-pathogens have contributed to the evolution
of fungal pathogenicity (Aim 3).
The project is innovative because: it will address fundamental, largely unanswered, questions in medical
mycology, such as how fungal pathogenicity evolved and why A. fumigatus infects hundreds of thousands yearly
but its very close relatives do not; b) it will generate invaluable resources, such as comprehensive, in-depth
examinations of variation for key disease-relevant traits and genetic elements in a lineage of closely related fungi
that vary extensively in their pathogenicity, and; it will lead to the generation of novel, genetically tractable model
organisms for studying how major fungal pathogens originate from historically innocuous organisms."

Despite recent advances with new therapies, a huge proportion of migraine patients are still unable to use
established therapeutics. For many patients, treatments are not effective, even newly approved CGRP mAbs
have response rates of only ~50%. For others they are unsafe due to contraindications (triptans), or like opioids,
not suited for long term use, even exacerbating existing migraine headache. This illustrates that there are still
major gaps in our understanding of migraine mechanisms. It is therefore imperative that we investigate the
underlying molecular mechanisms involved, geared towards identifying novel therapeutic targets with potential
for rapid translation to the clinic. Recent data have identified the adenosine A3 receptor (A3AR) as a novel target
for pain. Our recent work has also established that production of the highly noxious reactive nitroxidative species,
peroxynitrite (PN), causes downstream modifications to glutamatergic signaling and NLRP3/IL-1β-driven
neuroinflammation, to mediate nociceptive spinal sensitization. We show that A3AR agonists attenuate these
nociceptive mechanisms in diverse rodent models of neuropathic pain, providing persistent pain relief. Despite
this, little is known about A3AR-PN mechanisms in trigeminovascular migraine models. However, our preliminary
data demonstrate that A3AR are expressed in important peripheral and central regions along the migraine pain
pathway, and A3AR agonists inhibit migraine-like responses in several rodent models of migraine that are highly
predictive of therapeutic efficacy. Additional data also implicate both PN and NLRP3 production in mediating
migraine-like nociceptive responses. This is exciting as A3AR agonists are already in clinical trials in non-pain
disorders, have a good safety profile, and appear well suited for chronic pain management. Based on these
observations we hypothesize that PN production and activation of its downstream nociceptive signaling cascade
is involved in neuronal and behavioral outcomes in preclinical models of migraine-like headache, and A3AR
agonists inhibit these outcomes, via modulation of this PN signaling cascade. Our goal in Aim 1 will be to validate
A3AR as a novel therapeutic target for migraine-like headache using validated preclinical models of acute and
chronic migraine-like headache and established behavioral and electrophysiological techniques. We will also
measure the temporal expression and localization of A3AR along the migraine pain pathway. In Aim 2, using
pharmacological and genetic approaches, with biochemical analyses, we will test whether the beneficial effects
of A3AR agonists are exerted through inhibition of PN production, and attenuation of post-translational
modifications to neuronal and glial proteins involved in nociceptive glutamatergic neurotransmission and
NLRP3/IL-1β-driven neuroinflammation. Our results are anticipated to provide novel insights into the molecular
neuropharmacology related to dural-trigeminovascular activation in migraine. Importantly, these studies will
validate A3AR as a novel target for migraine treatment, which should accelerate ‘proof-of-concept’ clinical
studies, leading to a new translational effort in the treatment of migraine-like headache disorders."

Inflammasomes alert the mammalian immune system to the presence of infection and tissue damage. These
cytosolic protein complexes detect danger signals or microbial products released by a wide variety of intracellular
pathogens. In the case of bacterial pathogens, a number of prokaryotic signatures are recognized including the
major cell-wall constituent of most Gram-negative species, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Detection of LPS inside
host cells activates a “non-canonical“ inflammasome pathway where caspase-11 (Caspases 4 and 5 in humans)
act as upstream sensors to stimulate inflammasome complex assembly and processing of the pore-forming
protein, Gasdermin D (Gsdmd), further downstream. Gsdmd pores release protective cytokines and contribute
to a lytic form of cell death termed pyroptosis that may help eliminated infected host cells. How these sequential
events are co-ordinated and the host factors involved remains a major question in the field of innate immunity
and host defense. Here, we focus on members of a new 65-73kDa immune GTPase family termed Guanylate-
Binding Proteins (GBPs) that control distinct steps in the non-canonical pathway. Preliminary results suggest
Gbp2 may target cytosolic bacteria to help liberate LPS for caspase-11 detection whereas Gbp3 acts further
downstream to regulate Gsdmd trafficking to the plasma membrane. GBPs thus offer a unique opportunity to
understand how this sequential hierarchy unfolds. In Aim 1, we will test the respective contributions of Gbp2 and
Gbp3 to immunity against Gram-negative Salmonella typhimurium (Stm) infection via the non-canonical
inflammasome in vitro and in vivo. CRISPR-Cas9 deleted human and mouse cells as well as newly-created
Gbp2-/-, Gbp3-/- and GbpDchr.3H1 mice will be infected with Stm variants designed to interfere with GBP recruitment
or responsiveness to LPS. Thereafter, we will dissect the molecular mechanisms enlisted by these GBPs to
confer their intracellular functions as part of Aim 2. Here gene-deficient macrophages complemented with GBP
mutants with distinct biochemical lesions will reveal how GBPs direct the inflammasome core machinery to LPS-
positive bacteria or control downstream events such as Gsdmd trafficking and assembly on the plasma
membrane. Cell-free studies will also attempt to reconstitute the GBP “coatomer” on the bacterial outer
membrane that serves as a platform for inflammasome assembly. Collectively, our proposal examines a new set
of host factors that act at different stages within the non-canonical signaling cascade as part of a unique
functional hierarchy, helping choreograph these events with major implications for the treatment of sepsis and
Gram-negative bacterial infections."

Accurate modeling of immune receptors and their recognition is a major challenge in computational biology, of
direct relevance to many diseases and therapeutics. While they share common heterodimeric immunoglobulin
folds, the immense sequence diversities of T cell receptors (TCRs) and antibodies lead to an astounding range
of antigen binding modes and specificities. Current docking approaches are largely incapable of producing
near-native models of these complexes in the set of top-ranked predictions, and conformational flexibility of
TCR and antibody loops pose a major barrier to predictive algorithms. My laboratory has had a longstanding
interest in developing and applying algorithms to better model and design TCRs and antibodies. We recently
developed an algorithm and web server to model TCRs from sequence (TCRmodel), a database of TCR
structures and sequences (TCR3d), and we have assembled an updated docking benchmark, which is being
used to develop improvements to our TCR docking algorithm. We have also recently developed an updated
antibody-antigen docking and affinity benchmark, which more than doubles the size of the previous benchmark
release; we have performed docking and affinity prediction assessment on these cases, giving us a rich
dataset of models and scores. During the next five years, we plan to expand and capitalize on these datasets
to develop advanced knowledge-based tools and algorithms, including geometric deep learning methods, to
address major challenges in this area: reliable modeling of CDR3 loop structures, accurate predictive antibody-
antigen and TCR-peptide-MHC docking, and design of TCR and antibody targeting. This will result in the ability
to model TCR and antibody interaction structures from sequence, precise control of TCR and antibody affinity
and specificity, and the design of new interactions to target antigens of interest. We will release our methods
and results to the community as web servers, databases, and code. This work will be enhanced by
collaborations with leading laboratories, through which we will have access to new experimental structural,
dynamic, and affinity data which will be used to develop, apply, and validate our algorithms."
10754851,"Routinely-collected data generated in surveillance and diagnostic laboratories and medical records contain
information valuable for understanding the transmission of antimicrobial resistant pathogens. This information
can be harnessed to inform transmission models and to design and evaluate mitigation strategies. However,
current modeling approaches often focus on addressing one resistance on a pathogen at a time which leads to
key features of resistant pathogen dynamics such as multidrug resistance and pathogen interactions to not be
commonly addressed. In order to capitalize on the data being generated via surveillance and diagnostic
activity, we propose to carry out the following research activities: 1) we will develop graphical models to
integrate multiple data streams (phenotypic, genotypic resistances and metadata) to support analysis and
visualization of complex resistant patterns and joint distribution of resistances, 2) we will apply and evaluate
the analytical pipeline to data collected in national-level surveillance systems, 3) we will develop and evaluate
agent-based models for pathogen transmission in health-care settings that incorporate multidrug resistance
features and pathogen interactions and apply graphical modeling approaches to analyze and validate the
models, and 4) we will disseminate the tools by creating open source packages and through website
implementation. With the developed tools we will provide a path to quantify changes on complex resistance
patterns over time or across sources, identify drugs that can lead to further selection of first choice drugs,
identify cluster of risk factor for resistance and evaluate vaccination, antibiotic stewardship and heterogeneity
interventions in the presence of pathogen and resistance interactions.
The challenges of dealing with multiple streams of data and complex models are not unique to infectious
disease research. The developed workflows will be applicable to a broad spectrum of biomedical research
questions, particularly those that involve the collection of mixed data and simultaneous genotypic and
phenotypic data. Similarly, agent-based models are increasingly used across all biomedical disciplines, from
molecular biology to epidemiology, and therefore advances in their analyses can have a broader positive
impact in multiple biomedical disciplines."
10754852,"Virtually all eukaryotic organisms appropriately examined have been shown to possess the capacity for
endogenous temporal control and organization known as a circadian rhythm. The cellular machinery
responsible for generating rhythms is collectively known as the biological clock. A healthy circadian clock
underlies both physical and mental health. Because of the ubiquity of its influence on human mental and
physiological processes - from circadian changes in basic human physiology to the clear involvement of
rhythms in work/rest cycles and sleep - understanding the clock is basic to prevention and treatment of many
physical and mental illnesses, from metabolic disorders to sleep/wake dysfunction and cancer.
 Our research uses genetic and molecular studies of the model eukaryote Neurospora, as well as
mammalian cells in culture, to further our understanding of the organization of the circadian oscillator, a one-
step transcription-translation feedback loop whose regulatory architecture is conserved from fungi to mammals.
Planned research lies within three foci. Focus #1 builds upon our understanding of the interplay between
structure and function in core clock components. We will determine how phosphorylations and interactions
among clock components lead to repression within the feedback loop; address a controversy as to whether
negative element turnover has a role in the mammalian oscillator; probe how clock-controlled phosphorylation
guides essential interactions and activities of clock components leading to the canonical circadian property of
temperature compensation, and how modulation of RNA metabolism and gene expression contribute to
nutritional compensation. Focus #2 pioneers new territory and exploits recently developed techniques,
expanding the use of cell biological tools to complement genetics in defining the spatio-temporal dynamics of
clock components within the cell. We will show how, as well as where in the cell the clock operates. Focus #3
will build upon our strong grounding in the genetics and genomics of light-regulation, using computational and
informatic tools to define the hierarchical network of transcription factors that govern the response of
Neurospora to light and time. The aim is to provide the first concrete model for global circadian control of a
eukaryotic genome.
 Our long term goals are to describe, in the language of genetics and biochemistry, the feedback cycle
comprising the circadian clock, how this cycle is synchronized with the environment, and how time information
generated by the feedback cycle is used to regulate the behavior of cells and organisms. These projects are
complementary and mutually enriching in that they rely on genetic and molecular techniques to dissect, and
ultimately to understand, the organization of cells as a function of time."

The hematopoietic system offers an ideal biological system to develop tools to study how dynamic matrix,
metabolic, and cellular selection pressures influence stem cell fate. Hematopoiesis is the process where the
body’s blood and immune cells are generated from a small number of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). HSC
quiescence, self-renewal, and differentiation take place in, and are regulated by, unique regions of the bone
marrow termed niches. HSCs are also the functional unit of therapeutic bone marrow transplants following
myeloablative therapies. A major goal of the hematology community is to selectively expand HSCs without
sacrificing a subpopulation of quiescent, long-term repopulating HSCs required for life-long hematopoiesis. Yet
while the marrow is known to change substantially across the lifespan, studies of the influence of niche
remodeling on HSC behavior are in their infancy. The long-term goal of this Stimulating Hematology Investigation
New Endeavors (SHINE) project is to advance tissue engineering platforms to achieve HSC expansion without
exhaustion. In the previous funding period (R01DK099528) we established a tissue engineering ecosystem to
examine the coordinated impact of niche-inspired biophysical signals on HSC fate. We developed microfluidic
tools for extended culture of primary murine HSC in miniaturized gelatin hydrogels containing marrow-inspired
gradients of stiffness, niche cells, and soluble vs. immobilized biomolecules We showed the kinetics of HSC-
niche cell crosstalk can be manipulated via biomaterial design to enhance retention of quiescent HSCs.
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) within the marrow are increasingly believed to dynamically remodel the niche
and provide powerful signals to influence HSC fate. Hence, the objective of our renewal is to use an innovative
granular biomaterial to investigate the coordinated action of MSC remodeling and hypoxic stress on functional
changes in HSC activity. We hypothesize the mosaic nature of the bone marrow can be replicated as jammed
assemblies of cell-laden hydrogel microdroplets. We will create granular hydrogels from MSC and HSC
microdroplets to trace the consequences of matrix remodeling, metabolic constraint, and MSC-HSC crosstalk on
HSC fate. To accomplish this goal we will first establish an engineered model of MSC-mediated niche remodeling
(Aim 1). We will define shifts in HSC-MSC crosstalk under hypoxia (Aim 2). And we will evaluate a mosaic
granular hydrogel model of the multicellular marrow (Aim 3). Granular hydrogels provide the technical basis for
creating mosaic niche analogs necessary to study remodeling mediated effects on HSC activity. The well-
characterized murine hematopoietic system provides a rigorous framework to evaluate ex vivo regulatory
processes in niches whose rarity and complexity limit direct in vivo study. Consistent with score-driving criteria
of the SHINE program, we will develop essential tools to rigorously assess how dynamic processes of matrix
remodeling and HSC-niche cell crosstalk inform HSC stemness that is directly relevant to the NIDDK mission."
10901912,"Integrins are transmembrane receptors composed of α and β subunits that mediate interactions between cells
and extracellular matrix. There are 18 α and 8 β subunits, which form dimers with different ligand binding
properties. Integrins are classified into collagen, laminin and RGD binding receptors and regulate many cellular
functions including adhesion, migration, proliferation, differentiation, and polarization. We previously showed the
laminin binding integrins α3β1, α6β1 and α6β4 only play a minor role in kidney collecting system development.
By contrast we now demonstrate that deleting the integrin α3 subunit in the developing kidney metanephric
mesenchyme causes fatal renal abnormalities within a week of birth. When we introduced the same point
mutations as those described in infants who died from renal dysgenesis into the extracellular domain of the α3
integrin subunit, the mice died with dysgenic kidneys, however the phenotypes were not as severe as the integrin
α3-null mice. All three mice displayed severe kidney tubule and major glomerular abnormalities. As the
mechanism whereby integrin α3β1-laminin interactions regulate organogenesis is unclear, we developed mice
with a point mutation in the integrin binding site of the highly conserved γ1 laminin chain, which abrogates laminin-
integrin binding to most laminins, without altering the structural integrity of the laminin trimer. When this mutation
was introduced into the metanephric mesenchyme, the mice also developed dysplastic kidneys. Mechanistically
we have preliminary evidence that in addition to the classic integrin functions of cell adhesion and migration,
deleting Integrin α3β1 in polarized kidney epithelial cells causes severe proliferation defects with the cells unable
to progress normally through the cell cycle. We have previously shown that Integrin α3β1 regulates Akt
activation, a key requirement for cell proliferation. Taken together these new data suggest a critical role for
laminin-binding integrins in nephron development and maturation, which contrasts with the mild phenotypes we
found in the developing ureteric bud. Therefore, in this grant we will test the novel hypothesis that integrin α3β1
binding to laminin is critical for metanephric mesenchyme development and mutations that affect this interaction
results in fatal renal dysgenesis in the following aims: 1) Define the role of integrin-laminin interactions in
metanephric mesenchyme development. 2) Define the molecular mechanism whereby integrin α3β1-laminin
interactions promote proliferation in metanephric mesenchyme development."
10892402,"The over-arching goal of the Nominee’s, Richard F. ff. Weir, PhD, research is to improve the quality-of-life
of veterans and individuals with limb loss. Upper-limb prosthetics research is an area of particular interest and
relevance to VA. The Nominee and his team at the laboratory, the VA/CU Biomechatronics Development
Laboratory, seek to improve the prosthetic options available to veterans with limb loss through the application of
novel approaches and innovative technology to the development of clinically relevant prosthetic systems and
solutions. The Nominee has been in the field of Prosthesis design and Rehabilitation Research in one form or
another (Student, Post-doc, Scientist, Mentor) for over 25 years and has maintained extramural funding and
developed a large network of collaborators in that time. The Nominee holds joint appointments at both VA as a
Research Career Scientist and UC Denver|Anschtuz Medical Center in the Bioengineering Department. The
Nominee currently mentors 1 CDA2 Candidate, 4 PhD candidates and 4 MS candidates and has mentored
another 2 CDA Candidates, 8 PhD candidates and 22 MS candidates. The Nominee has aided and supported
trainees in identifying and transitioning into translational careers.
 While it is a personal goal of the Nominee to be able to develop an artificial hand replacement capable of
true dexterous manipulation for use by persons with upper-limb loss the Nominee and his team explore all
aspects of the problem ranging from neural control and sensing; mechatronic design and development; novel
actuator technologies; novel physical suspension/interface techniques; clinical deployment of these systems;
methods to manage phantom limb pain; conducting clinical testing of the systems developed. The Nominee has
had numerous contracts and grants to develop advanced limb systems for several different Federal agencies
including VA, NIH, and DARPA. Over that time, in addition to being a VA Researcher and academic researcher,
the Nominee completed the training required to become a clinical prosthetist, was National Director of Research
for Advanced Arm Dynamics (AAD) for 2 years, (AAD is a national provider of upper-limb prosthetics care) and
most recently founded Point Designs, LLC, as a conduit for translation of his Laboratory’s developments.
 It is these clinical experiences that inform the Nominee’s belief he should explore and provide practical
solutions for immediately pressing clinical problems while also exploring ideas that push the envelope of current
technology. The Nominee’s VA projects aim to address issues of more immediate clinical relevance like our
project to develop artificial fingers suitable for women veterans [2I01RX002830(Weir)] while at the same time-
exploring via a VA SPiRE [IK21RX003471(Weir)] using blood sugar as a fuel for a novel implanted fuel cell.
Much of the Nominee’s non-VA research is centered around using optics to interrogate nerves. True dexterous
manipulation needs sensory feedback (touch, pressure, force). Thus, a bidirectional control interface is needed,
one for motor commands and one for sensation. The Nominee is exploring the use of optogenetic methods to
non-invasively excite action potentials within neurons as a means of creating sensory percepts. Optogenetic
neuromodulation of the vagus nerve has the potential for board reaching impact and indeed we have a VA SPiRE
to explore optical modulation of the vagus as a potential treatment paradigm for PTSD [I21RX003894-
01(Fontaine)]. Another recent collaboration is one with Dr. Paul Cederna to develop a surface myoelectric sensor
for his Regenerative peripheral nerve interface (RPNI) this is exciting because it looks like prophylactic use of
RPNI’s with cut nerves might help mitigate phantom limb pain, a primary driver of prosthesis rejection, while at
the same time creating/providing additional independent control sites. The barrier to using RPNI for control has
been the need for some sort of implanted sensor [CDMRP W81XWH2110771(Kemp)].
 All in all, I believe we are doing exciting and relevant research and to have the protected effort this VA RR&D
RCS award provides has been truly enabling."
10914926,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There are limited opportunities in Africa to work with routine clinical and health data at scale, and to develop the
expertise to process these data in an environment in which both the burden of disease and the approach to
enumeration and coding are very different to other settings where routine data are exploited for epidemiological
analyses. Tuberculosis disease (TB) is the most important HIV-associated comorbidity in South Africa and the
leading cause of death in people living with HIV (PLH). Maternal TB (pregnancy and postpartum period)
deleteriously affects morbidity and mortality in women and infants. Pregnancy outcomes are worse, exacerbated
by HIV co-infection which is present in 60%, and there is increased risk of perinatal TB and HIV transmission.
Rifampicin-resistant (RR)-TB with/without fluoroquinolone resistance is a growing global public health concern
with prevalence rates at 4.2% of TB cases in the Western Cape Province, South Africa. South Africa was prompt
to include novel and repurposed second-line therapeutic agents against RR-TB in routine guidelines, including
pregnant and lactating people. The safety of these agents during pregnancy and lactation is uncertain but the
rising incidence of RR-TB has seen the use of these agents during pregnancy at scale. The concomitant use of
antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV treatment raises concerns about potential drug-drug interactions with safety
and efficacy implications. Maternal TB remains under-prioritized globally despite the burden of HIV and TB in
those of child-bearing age.
In this context of high infectious burden in which novel/repurposed anti-mycobacterial agents for the prevention
and treatment of TB are used at scale during pregnancy, often co-administered with ART, the Western Cape is
uniquely positioned in hosting the Provincial Health Data Centre (PHDC), the first comprehensive linked health
information exchange in Africa. The PHDC leverages the use of a province-wide unique patient identifier issued
to users of the health services to harmonise all electronic health data from routine health information systems in
public sector facilities, including laboratory, pharmacy, administrative and other clinical data. These data are
integrated and curated to enable inference of health conditions using phenotype algorithms, as well as to enable
the consolidation of co-morbidities and construction of patient-level cascades that can be used to monitor and
analyse health service utilisation patterns and healthcare outcomes.
The partnership between the Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology & Research, University of Cape Town
and the Health Intelligence Directorate of the Western Cape Government which houses the PHDC offers a
unique opportunity to develop and evaluate a robust maternal TB data platform, using data science to i) create
actionable clinical tools to optimize person-level interventions and monitor programs; ii) generate large, linked
cohorts to address the epidemiological questions of maternal TB and assess the impact of policy interventions
and clinical tools at the population and individual levels."

There are ~40 million people world-wide infected by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1,
commonly referred to as HIV). As currently there is no cure, antiretroviral treatment is the primary treatment
option. Yet antiretroviral treatment eventually fails over time due to the development of drug resistance. We will
develop new computational tools for forecasting HIV evolutionary trajectories under therapeutic selection
pressure leading to drug resistance, using high resolution all atom molecular dynamics simulations together with
physics-based machine learning models of sequence co-variation. The computational studies will be
complemented by structural, biophysical, and virological studies on two HIV protein multimeric targets: HIV
integrase (IN), and capsid (CA). The modeling and experiments will be employed in an iterative manner, with
the experimental results being used to validate, parameterize and improve the models; and the molecular
dynamics simulations used to guide new experiments and also to develop new tools for high resolution cryo-EM
refinement of multiple binding modes of HIV inhibitors and interfacial solvent. The common theme of our
proposed work is to provide structural interpretations for the observed fitness and resistance effects of mutations,
with the goal of developing holistic structure-function models which can be used to predict viral mutation
trajectories under drug selection pressure and give a mechanistic explanation for them. There are three specific
aims: (1) determine the physical mechanisms underlying mutational epistasis under varied drug environments,
and use MD simulations and virological data to parameterize drug specific landscapes for HIV IN and CA under
a novel theoretical framework; (2) use high resolution, large scale alchemical molecular dynamics free energy
simulations based on advanced sampling methods to analyze the effects of protein mutations on the stability of
protein-protein interfaces that constitute the intasome and the capsid particle assemblies; (3) determine the
molecular basis for multiple binding modes of inhibitors of HIV IN, and the role of solvation in the strong binding
of these inhibitors. These aims seek to achieve a molecular understanding of the cooperative effects (epistasis)
of multi-residue mutation patterns on the binding of inhibitors to their viral protein targets (IN, CA) and their effects
on the stability of the multimers (intasome and capsid particle). We anticipate that this work will lead to the
development of surveillance tools to forecast the response of viral systems to the selection pressure of antiviral
therapeutics."
10917337,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an important cause of human lymphomas in both immunocompetent and
immunosuppressed humans, including Burkitt lymphomas (BLs), Hodgkin lymphomas (HLs) and diffuse large B
cell lymphomas (DLBCLs). There are three different types of EBV latency (types I, II and III) that differ in the
number of latent viral proteins expressed and transforming ability. Only type III viral latency (in which all 9 latent
viral proteins are expressed) can transform primary human B cell in vitro, but because type III latency is highly
immunogenic, EBV+ tumors with type III latency in humans are relatively rare and largely found in
immunosuppressed hosts. EBV+ HLs and DLBCLs in humans commonly have type II latency (characterized by
expression of EBNA1, LMP1 and LMP2A), while EBV+ BLs, which contain MYC translocations, have type I
latency (in which EBNA1 is the only viral protein expressed). However, there is currently no in vivo or in vitro
model available to study how EBV infection causes lymphomas with type I or type II latency, since this form of
viral latency is not transforming in vitro and wild-type EBV-induced lymphomas in humanized mouse models
inevitably support type III latency. EBNA2 transcriptionally activates each of the latent viral promoters used
during type III latency. Using a newly constructed EBNA2-deleted EBV mutant (ΔEBNA2 EBV) made by our lab,
we have developed a novel culture system that allows us to stably infect primary naïve B cells in vitro with this
mutant, and to examine the effect of MYC over-expression. Our exciting preliminary results show that B cells
infected with ΔEBNA2 EBV form DLBCL-like and HL-like tumors with type II viral latency at late time points in
NSG mice, and that over-expressing the MYC gene (using a retroviral vector) in ΔEBNA2 EBV-infected B cells
results in rapid onset of aggressive tumors that resemble human BLs and support type I EBV latency. In contrast,
expression of MYC alone does not cause tumors in this model. As human BLs, DLBCLs and HLs are derived
from germinal center (GC) B cells, in Aim 1, we will use this new model to examine the ability of ΔEBNA2 EBV-
infected primary GC B cells (with or without MYC over-expression) to form lymphomas in NSG mice. In Aim 2,
we will identify the specific EBV genes (and/or viral RNAs) required for the development of ΔEBNA2 EBV-
induced tumors (with or without MYC) in naïve versus GC B cells. In Aim 3, we will define mechanisms by which
MYC turns off LMP1 expression in ΔEBNA2 EBV-induced lymphomas and determine if small molecules that can
restore LMP1 expression enhance the immune response to tumors in humanized mice. The proposed
experiments will provide the first model system to define how types I and II EBV latency cause lymphomas in
human GC B cells and to ask if restoration of LMP1 expression in BLs enhances the host immune response."

This project focus in the biology of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) that are common aggressive
malignancies with a curability rate of 65% despite intensive chemoimmunotherapy. DLBCLs display an array of
genetic alterations, that define molecular subtypes, and strong dependence on the microenvironment for survival.
We hypothesize that reprogramming of the stromal microenvironment is critical for the oncogenicity of hallmark
mutations that mediate lymphoma progression and immune evasion. We propose to elucidate the roles of the
cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) and extracellular matrix (ECM) components of the lymphoma
microenvironment to identify therapeutic vulnerabilities. CAFs are derived from healthy fibroblasts that have been
reprogrammed by cancer cells into a novel biological entity. Our long-term goal is to therapeutically exploit
reprogrammed CAFs with consideration of genetically-defined DLBCLs. For this reason, it is critical to elucidate
the mechanisms involved in CAF reprogramming. Not all CAFs are reprogrammed in the same way. Moreover,
rather than a terminal effect, CAF reprogramming as a transcriptionally dynamic process that allows the
establishment of a variety of adaptive phenotypes. Our preliminary data suggest the activation of “shared” and
“private” pathways in the reprogramming of CAFs. We specifically identify and studied the role of HSF1, one of
the “shared” transcription factors in CAFs. CAFs without HSF1 failed to produce an ECM with the biochemical
composition and mechanical properties required for lymphoma progression. Concomitantly, lack of HSF1 in the
TME allowed the establishment of an effective lymphoma immune response leading to tumor eradication. We
plan to test our central hypothesis and accomplish the objective of this application by pursuing these specific
aims: Aim 1. Elucidate mechanisms of CAFs reprogramming that sustain genetically diverse DLBCLs:
We will identify CAFs sub-populations and ECM composition in genetic DLBCL subtypes; and identify molecular
pathways and reprogramming factors across and within CAFs sub-populations using HSF1 as lead effector. Aim
2. Elucidate the role of CAFs in functionalizing the ECM for immune evasion. We will characterize
biomechanical and biochemical constraints imposed by CAFs to an effective lymphoma immunity. Aim 3.
Determine the therapeutic impact of targeting CAFs in genetic DLBCL subtypes. We will determine the
anti-lymphoma effect of co-targeting CAFs and lymphoma cells in molecularly-defined pre-clinical DLBCL murine
models. The studies that we propose will provide significant insights on the mechanisms of stromal TME
reprogramming for the establishment of genetically defined DLBCLs and will contribute towards development of
novel therapeutic strategies focused on targeting the stromal TME in these entities to increase curability."

The typical course of treatment for uncomplicated Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection comprises
four antibiotics and lasts for at least six months. The impermeability of the multi-layered M.
tuberculosis cell envelope has long been linked to the organism’s intrinsically-poor drug susceptibility.
While the outer ‘myco’ membrane is hypothesized to be the primary barrier to accessing antibiotic
targets in the peptidoglycan or cytoplasm, other facets of the envelope likely contribute. Moreover,
compared to the model organism Escherichia coli and to mammalian cells, the field has only a
rudimentary understanding of the kinds of compounds that can permeate M. tuberculosis. Based on
published and preliminary data, the PIs hypothesize that M. tuberculosis impermeability is a
consequence of envelope composition as well as the target location and chemical structure of the
compound. A major hurdle to testing this hypothesis is the lack of high-throughput tools for identifying
bacterial and molecular factors that control compound permeation across envelope layers. In this
proposal, The PIs develop and deploy two complementary methods for defining the bacterial and
molecular determinants of M. tuberculosis impermeability. They will first test the relative importance of
various M. tuberculosis factors in molecule gate-keeping. Next, they will globally determine the M.
tuberculosis genes that contribute to mycomembrane impermeability. Finally, they will
comprehensively determine the structural motifs associated with M. tuberculosis mycomembrane
permeation or lack thereof. Successful completion of these aims will lay the foundation for medicinal
chemistry efforts to improve M. tuberculosis uptake of both existing drugs and newly-discovered
compounds. The methods that the PIs use to achieve these aims are easily ported to species for
which envelope permeability is also treatment-limiting, e.g., non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTMs)
and Gram-negatives."
11051761,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Cardiac hypertrophy is a leading risk factor for heart failure. This remodeling, which occurs with various
pathological insults including chronic hypertension, was long thought to be irreversible. However, clinical
evidence suggests that partial reverse remodeling (regression) is possible in a small subset of patients with
existing therapies and is associated with improved outcomes. The molecular mechanisms underlying
regression remain poorly understood. Cardiac hypertrophy can also occur in healthy settings (e.g., pregnancy
and exercise), although here it is rapidly reversible with removal of the stimulus. In my preliminary studies
using animal models of physiological hypertrophy (post-prandial Burmese python, exercised and pregnant
mice), I identified the transcription factor Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) is inhibited during hypertrophy
development and then upregulated with regression, leading to increased expression of autophagy genes. This
finding led to the hypothesis that FOXO1-dependent autophagy might underly regression. The potential role of
FOXO1 as a putative regulator of regression was corroborated using a small molecular inhibitor in an in vitro
hypertrophy model. These findings suggest that modulating FOXO1 or its downstream gene targets may
represent a new therapeutic avenue for heart failure. The goal of this research plan is to investigate the
involvement of FOXO1 and autophagy in the regression of cardiac hypertrophy and to characterize the
potential of targeting these factors for treating heart failure and reversing pathological remodeling. Specifically,
I will use adenovirus-mediated gene therapy to deliver FOXO1 or downstream autophagy genes to
cardiomyocytes cultured with factors that promote physiological or pathological. I will further explore the
therapeutic potential of targeting this pathway in vivo, using adeno-associated virus gene therapy in a mouse
heart failure model. My long-term goals are to identify how protein quality control mechanisms regulate
cardiomyocyte size, function, and longevity, and how they are impacted in disease settings. This fellowship will
help me develop expertise with designing and amplifying adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses for the
modulation of lead therapeutic targets/pathways in cell and animal models of hypertrophy. Moreover, the
exposure to multiple in vitro and in vivo cardiac models will help prepare me for a career as an independent
investigator of the biology underlying cardiac remodeling."

 In the United States alone, over 600,00 babies are born each year that will go on to suffer
from a neurodevelopmental disorder including autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit
disorder, and other intellectual disabilities. A major obstacle to preventing and treating
neurodevelopmental disorders is that the first steps of brain development occur often before the
pregnancy is discovered. The first step of brain development, in which the bilateral halves of the
neuroepithelium converge to form the neural tube, is a period of rapid morphogenesis that creates
heightened metabolic demand. The neural tube is sensitive to changes in maternal metabolism
and disease states such as maternal hyperglycemia and folate deficiency have been linked to
neurological disability. Neural tube closure occurs before the placenta is established and nutrients
are instead absorbed and processed by the yolk sac. How maternal-fetal nutrient exchange is
regulated during neural tube closure is not well understood. The yolk sac also generates cells that
migrate into the early brain to control neuronal differentiation during neural tube closure. It is
poorly understood how yolk sac-derived cells regulate development of the neuroepithelium.
MicroRNA function in the yolk sac is critical for embryonic growth, suggesting a role in maternal-
fetal nutrient exchange. Whether microRNAs regulate maternal-fetal nutrient exchange across
the yolk sac remains unknown. We find that miR-290 is robustly expressed in the yolk sac
endoderm and loss of miR-290 in hyperglycemic pregnancies results in a failure of neural tube
closure. Further, we find miR-290 expressing yolk sac-derived blood cells at the basal
neuroepithelium. Upon miR-290 deletion we find a reduction in yolk sac-derived blood cells in the
embryonic cranial region and a significant reduction of neurogenesis. We hypothesize that miR-
290 regulates maternal-fetal nutrient exchange across the yolk sac and that yolk sac-derived
blood cells are required for proper neuroepithelial development. The proposed work will uncover
how the interaction between the yolk sac and developing embryo facilitates brain development
and will be critical for preventing intellectual disability. The major goals of this study are to identify
how miR-290 regulates development and function of the yolk sac during neural tube closure and
determine how yolk sac-derived cells regulate neuroepithelial development. Understanding how
the yolk sac controls neural tube closure and early brain development will present a new
therapeutic approach to prevent neurodevelopmental disorders."

Postnatal sensory experience has a profound effect on the maturation, composition, and connectivity of cortical
cell types, but systematic analyses of these changes have not yet been feasible. This lack of methods for
systematic analysis had made it difficult to define principles in how neural activity re-wires brain circuits and
whether connectivity changes precede or follow molecular changes in brain cell types. Systematically
characterizing how neural activity from the sensory periphery shapes the molecular and synaptic properties of
neural circuits in the brain would benefit from new technologies in which synaptic connectivity relationships and
genome-wide RNAs could be measured in vivo from the same individual cells. High-throughput, single-cell
resolved methods to profile gene expression and synaptic connectivity – including the barcoded rabies virus-
based method called Slide-SBARRO method developed in the Saunders Lab - are well suited to study how
sensory input influences cortical circuit formation. In Aim 1, I will use an inducible mouse model paired with single
nucleus RNA sequencing of primary auditory cortex (A1) cells to determine how auditory input shapes cortical
cell-type proportions and gene expression. In Aim 2, I will determine how auditory input shapes local synaptic
relationships within A1 by reconstructing hundreds of spatially resolved and cell-type-specific monosynaptic
networks using Slide-SBARRO. By comprehensively characterizing how auditory sensory input alters brain cell
and circuit properties in A1, this proposal will enhance our understanding of the mechanisms through which
cortex responds to damage in the sensory periphery. Finally, this proposal will allow me to develop new technical
skills and intellectual approaches that I will use to study auditory circuit plasticity as an independent researcher."
10753483,"Project Summary/Abstract: CD8+ T cells (CTLs) mediate protective tumor immunity. The goal of tumor
immune therapy is to engender long-term protective effector T cell immunity and cause tumor eradiation in
patients with cancer. To this end, tumor cells must be receptive and susceptible to CTL-mediated tumor killing.
However, in addition to the quality and quantity of CTLs, what determines tumor cell receptivity to CTL-
mediated tumor killing is poorly understood. It is essential to conduct comprehensive molecular and functional
research on the nature of tumor cell receptivity to CTLs in the human tumor microenvironment.
Tumor biologists have been working on how tumor metabolism enables tumor cell proliferation, survival, and
invasiveness without a comprehensive consideration of the immune involvement. Recent immunological
studies have started to examine how tumor metabolism affects the phenotype and function of different immune
cell subsets in the tumor microenvironment. Yet, how tumor metabolism affects tumor cell receptivity to CTL-
killing is basically unknown. Having established an Optical Tweezers Microscope (OTM) technique and Atomic
Force Microscope (AFM) for cell elasticity and stiffness measurements and applied an airflow-assisted
desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (AFADESI-MSI), we are able to preliminarily
demonstrate that human and mouse breast tumor cells empowered with particular amino acid uptake resulted
in reduced myosin II-mediated contractile activation and tumor cell stiffness. Loss of tumor stiffness led to
tumor cell membrane resistance to perforin drilling force and pore formation by CTLs, resulting in impaired T
cell-mediated tumor killing. Mechanistically, tumor cells were addicted to certain amino acids, including
glutamine, via high expression of SLC6A14, a glutamine transporter. Interestingly, tumor SLC6A14 expression
was controlled by hypoxia. These data reveal previously unknown mechanisms of connection between specific
amino acid metabolism, hypoxia, and T cell immunity in the tumor microenvironment, thereby identifying
cancer glutamine transporter(s) as a potential novel immune metabolic checkpoint target.
Based on these surprising and novel findings, we hypothesize that cancer cell stiffness determines tumor cell
receptivity to CTL-killing, and the interplay between hypoxia and particular amino acid uptake is a novel
immune evasion mechanism in the tumor microenvironment. We propose two specific aims and 8 subaims to
test our central hypothesis that hypoxia targets tumor amino acid transporters, exemplified by SLC6A14, to
alter tumor cell receptivity to CTL-killing and tumor immunity and therapy. Our specific aims are:
Aim 1 is to test our hypothesis that hypoxia metabolically weakens tumor receptivity to CTL-killing.
Aim 2 is to test our hypothesis that hypoxia mechanically weakens tumor receptivity to CTL-killing."

Oxidation reactions are among the most important reactions in organic chemistry and play a crucial role in the
synthesis of pharmaceuticals, natural products, and other bioactive compounds. Advances in catalytic oxidation
reactions have potential for major impact in the discovery and production of pharmaceuticals. The majority of
existing catalytic oxidation methods face challenges in their efficiency and selectivity, including chemo-, regio-
and stereoselectivity, limiting their use in small- and large-scale applications. The proposed research will develop
new oxidation and oxidative coupling methods that form carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds, including
C(sp3)–H functionalization reactions. Some of the resulting methods will streamline the discovery of new
bioactive molecules with diverse three-dimensional architectures, addressing key challenges in medicinal
chemistry and drug discovery, while others will provide the basis for streamlined process-scale synthesis of
pharmaceuticals. Three complementary project directions are outlined in this proposal. The first focuses on the
development of ""oxidase""-type aerobic oxidation catalysts that feature a transition metal and a redox active
organic co-catalyst. New bioinspired catalyst systems will be explored that exhibit ""second-order biomimicry"",
whereby simple organic precursors undergo oxidative self-processing to create the essential co-catalysts. This
process resembles the post-translational modification of amino acid side chains to generate reactive cofactors
in Nature. The second project will pursue new electrochemical oxidation methods for the synthesis of organic
molecules that are difficult to access via classical synthetic methods. These efforts target the identification of
versatile mediators and electrocatalysts that permit the reactions to proceed at low electrode potentials, thereby
tolerating diverse functional groups and enabling broad scope and utility. Finally, we will develop ""radical relay""
methods for benzylic C–H oxidation and oxidative coupling to afford new C(sp3) C–O, C–N, C–X, and C–C bonds.
These efforts will be applied to pharmaceutical building-block diversification, core-modification, and late-stage
functionalization. In each of these project areas, empirical reaction discovery efforts will be complemented by
mechanistic studies of the catalytic reactions. Close interactions and collaborations with pharmaceutical
companies in all phases of this project will play an important role in ensuring the broadest possible impact of our
efforts."

Induction of inflammation by canonical microbial ligands by engaging classical patten recognition receptors
(PRR) has many beneficial outcomes including elimination of the pathogen and activation of adaptive
immunity that serves as protection against reinfection. However, unwarranted inflammation can also be
induced by aberrant activation of PRRs by noxious agents (toxins, uric acid etc) or because of naturally
occurring mutations in sensors or adapters of the innate immune system leading to auto-inflammatory
diseases such as Cryopyrin Associated Inflammatory Syndromes, and Interferonopathies. Auto-immune
diseases on the other hand are different than auto-inflammatory diseases as the culprits that trigger
pathology are self-reactive T and B cells. Auto-immune inflammation can lead to debilitating outcomes
because of damage to vital organs such as kidney, pancreas intestines as well as Skin and joints.
Paradoxically, many of the clinical treatments for T cell auto-immune diseases are all directed towards
inflammatory cytokines made by the innate immune system. Our previous work demonstrated that effector
and effector memory CD4 T cells have the capacity to drive IL-1b production, completely independent of
pattern recognition receptor activation. We discovered that Effector CD4 T cells provide both signal 1
(TNFa) and signal 2 (FasL) to instruct the myeloid cells to produce IL-1b in a Caspase-8 dependent
manner. The current proposal is based on very strong preliminary data that demonstrates that effector CD4
T cells in fact have the capacity to mimic microbial ligands to drive a broad pro-inflammatory program in
cells of the innate immune system. We find that effector memory CD4 T cells induce additional genes in
Dendritic cells that sets up important questions related to “T cell instruction” of the innate immune system.
Here we posit that while proximal activation of PRRs is necessary for naïve T cell activation, effector
memory T cells have the ability to directly activate the innate immune system thus bypassing the need for
PRR sensing. Although this might have evolved as a beneficial arm of the innate adaptive cross-talk, we
propose to understand the detrimental outcomes of adaptive instruction of innate immunity in driving
inflammation and tissue pathology. In order to gain mechanistic understanding of innate inflammation driven
by effector CD4 T cells, we propose three aims where 1. We will examine and characterize the nature of
innate inflammation driven by different effector memory T cell lineages and identify the molecular players
involved in this process, 2. We will investigate the molecular mechanisms by which effector memory CD4 T
cells drive innate inflammation with a particular focus on STING and DNA damage and 3. We will examine
the impact of CD4 T cell effector/effector memory CD4 T cell driven innate inflammation on auto-immune
disease and pathology. Successful completion of these aims will provide novel insights into T cell driven
innate inflammation independent and will open up new targets to treat auto-immune diseases."

Our goal is to discover how closely related species adopted unrelated axis determinants for specifying the
anterior embryo. Many aspects of animal development are conserved between species as different as humans
and flies, but some key regulators change very rapidly over the course of evolution for unknown reasons.
Explaining such unexpected plasticity in developmental gene networks will help us understand the basic science
of developmental robustness and congenital disease in all animals, including humans. Comparing multiple
closely related species is a powerful approach for understanding causes of plasticity in gene networks. This
approach is extremely difficult to implement with vertebrate model organisms but can be readily accomplished
in insects. Flies (Diptera) are particularly suitable because they include Drosophila melanogaster, one of the
leading model organisms in developmental biology, and because other dipteran species that can be cultured in
a laboratory setting are amenable to functional studies. Our research in a variety of dipteran model organisms
during the previous funding period established that these closely related species use a broad range of anterior
determinants (ADs) for establishing embryo polarity and anterior-specific gene expression, most likely through
the formation of long-range transcription factor gradients with morphogen-like activity. This discovery enables us
to examine why key developmental regulators can be highly unstable in evolution.
 While Drosophila’s AD (Bicoid) is a classic morphogen model, it is not known whether its mechanism of
action can be generalized nor how the evolutionary transition to Bicoid-dependent pattern formation was
achieved. The first of these two questions will be addressed by identifying and characterizing chromatin and
gene targets of the AD in the moth fly Clogmia albipunctata, Cal-Opamat (Aim 1) and of the AD in the
common midge Chironomus riparius, Panish (Aim 2). This will be done by testing for AD-dependent
chromatin accessibility in stage-matched embryos with or without reduced AD activity, using ATAC-seq and
RNAi. These experiments will be complemented as needed by ChIP-seq, and by characterizing the expression
and function of predicted target genes in vivo. The second question, concerning the transition to Bicoid-
dependent pattern formation, will be addressed by determining the mechanism of anterior specification in
the soldier fly Hermetia illucens (Aim 3). This organism was chosen because it is the closest tractable
outgroup to the clade of species with bicoid. A pilot study revealed several AD candidates, including Hil-Stau,
the ortholog of Staufen. This RNA-binding protein binds bicoid mRNA in early Drosophila embryos. To identify
Hermetia’s AD, anterior-localized and Hil-Stau-binding mRNAs will be determined by expression studies, co-
immunoprecipitation, sequencing, and their function will be examined by RNAi. The determination of the anterior-
specification mechanisms of Clogmia, Chironomus, and Hermetia will result in a new framework for explaining
evolutionary plasticity of a key regulator in a classic model for pattern formation and gene regulation."
10753495,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) in patients with epilepsy is more than 20-fold higher
than that of death in the general population. Clinical and animal studies show that seizure-induced respiratory
arrest is the primary event leading to death. Increased serotonin (5-HT) levels in the brain reduce seizure-
induced respiratory arrest in provoked seizure models. However, it is unclear whether enhancing 5-HT neuro-
transmission exerts protective effects on seizure-induced sudden death in spontaneous seizure (epilepsy)
models and which 5-HT circuitry is involved in this sudden death in both provoked and spontaneous seizure
models. These gaps in knowledge have significantly hindered the therapeutics to prevent SUDEP in patients.
The long-term goal is to foster effective prevention strategies against SUDEP using approaches targeted to
specific SUDEP mechanisms. The overall objectives of this proposal are to (1) determine the efficacy of 5-HT-
enhancing agents in suppressing seizure-induced sudden death and (2) elucidate the involved 5-HT circuitry
mechanisms in animal models, especially in a widely-used mouse model of human Dravet syndrome (a type of
epilepsy) that displays spontaneous seizures with a high rate of seizure-induced sudden death. The central
hypothesis is that enhanced 5-HT signaling prevents seizure-induced sudden death, and that the 5-HT raphe-
amygdala circuitry is involved in this sudden death in DBA/1 and Dravet mice. The rationale for this proposal is
that a determination of preclinical therapeutic efficacy of 5-HT-enhancing agents and 5-HT neuronal circuitry
mechanisms in seizure-induced sudden death is likely to offer a strong scientific framework by which new
strategies against human SUDEP can be developed. The central hypothesis will be tested in the following two
specific aims: 1) Determine the protective effects of enhancing 5-HT neurotransmission on seizure-induced
sudden death in DBA/1 and Dravet mice; and 2) Elucidate how 5-HT circuitry from raphe nuclei to the amygda-
la modifies seizure-induced sudden death in DBA/1 and Dravet mice. We will employ a combination of simul-
taneous video EEG/ECG/plethysmography monitoring, electrophysiology, pharmacology and cell-type specific
technologies (optogenetics and DREADDs) to perform the work in these aims. The proposed research is inno-
vative because it defines a novel 5-HT circuitry mechanism of seizure-induced sudden death using optogenet-
ics and DREADDs in animal models, especially in a human disease model, which could conceptually advance
the knowledge on the pathophysiological mechanisms of SUDEP. The proposed work is significant because
the expected outcomes will potentially foster targeted pharmacologic and neurostimulatory interventions of
SUDEP to save lives of at-risk patients."
10753498,"Genome characterization has enabled the cataloging of genes altered in human tumors and stimulated the
development of therapies that exploit these alterations. Still, functional studies are ultimately needed to interpret
and exploit the genetic variation that exists in human cancers. Furthermore, it is now apparent that cancer
phenotypes and responses to therapy are dramatically influenced by the tissue microenvironment, and hence it
is necessary to have in vivo models that accurately recapitulate both the genetics and physiology of cancers in
patients. Although existing genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) have been instrumental in validating
cancer-promoting mutations and developing therapeutic concepts in a physiological and relevant context, these
models are simply too slow and expensive to be broadly useful and only recapitulate a minor fraction of the
genetic lesions associated with human cancer. Driven by the need for more accurate and facile models, this
project combines CRISPR genome engineering and in vivo organ electroporation with the goal of producing the
first-in-kind collection of genetically-defined mouse models of three major epithelial malignancies. We refer to
these models as electroporation-based genetically engineered mouse models (EPO-GEMMs). EPO-GEMMs
have a range of advantages over traditional GEMMs in that they are fast, affordable, modular, highly portable,
and avoid the substantial waste associated with GEMMs produced by strain intercrossing. These models are
fully somatic, enable focal tumor development and, importantly, enable the study of tumor-host interactions by
allowing tumors to be rapidly engineered in hosts of different genetic backgrounds. Based on substantial
preliminary data to validate the EPO-GEMM concepts, our project will produce and characterize EPO-GEMMs
of stomach, prostate, and pancreatic cancer - three common human cancers for which existing mouse models
do not exist or are tedious. We will then perform a series of demonstration projects to evaluate and illustrate the
unique potential of the EPO-GEMM approach, ranging from testing the efficacy and toxicity of target inhibition,
exploring the effects of specific immune cell types on cancer initiation and progression, and using synchronous
cohorts of genetically defined cancer models to test new targeted therapies and immune oncology approaches.
Therefore, our project is of direct relevance to the overarching goals of the Oncology Models Forum, as EPO-
GEMMs constitute “translational research models that are robust representations of human biology, are
appropriate to test questions of clinical importance, and provide reliable information for patients’ benefit”. Each
of these models will be credentialed with the Oncology Model Fidelity Score and all reagents will be made
available through the NCIP Hub. We believe that the development and detailed characterization of rapid, flexible,
and immunocompetent EPO-GEMMs and the adoption of these models for pre-clinical studies will be critical for
the functional annotation of genetic variation in human cancer and greatly contribute to the implementation of
precision oncology."
10753499,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 Tobacco product labeling is a critical public health policy, and most countries around the world require
health warning labels (HWLs) on cigarette pack exteriors. One labeling option is cigarette package inserts –
small printed leaflets inside of cigarette packs. For over a century, cigarette manufacturers have used inserts to
reach smokers with promotional messages every time they open a new pack. However, inserts remain
underused for public health communication. Canada is the only country in the world that has both HWLs and
inserts, for which our recent research finds very promising results on their effectiveness for helping smokers
quit. The US Food and Drug Administration currently is developing new labels for cigarettes in the US, and
research is urgently needed to support its decision making.
 Our proposed study is based on the importance of “efficacy” messages about the benefits of behavior
change and that build confidence to change behavior, which is the type of message used on Canadian inserts.
Efficacy messages on inserts may be most effective when accompanied by large pictorial HWLs that show
harms from smoking. We aim to evaluate whether inserts with efficacy messages promote smoking cessation:
 AIM 1: We will evaluate the impact of inserts with efficacy messages using an experiment among adult
smokers in the US. In Study 1, 320 smokers will be put into one of four labeling groups: 1. no inserts or
pictorial HWLs; 2. inserts only; 3. pictorial HWLs only; 4. inserts & pictorial HWLs. Smokers will be given a 14-
day supply of their preferred cigarette brand with packs labeled according to their group. Participants will
answer a brief survey at the end of each day and four other times each day. We will study whether smokers in
each group experience different psychological responses or behaviors associated with smoking cessation.
 AIM 2: We will evaluate the impact of an `inserts' labeling policy in Canada by following two groups of adult
smokers who will be surveyed before and after Canada puts new inserts and HWLs on packs in 2020. Study
2a participants will answer surveys for 14 days (as in Study 1) both before and after the new policy is in place.
In Study 2b we will survey 1500 smokers every 4 months over 2 years, covering the period before (3 surveys)
and after (4 surveys) the new policy. The timing and questions for Studies 2a and 2b will allow us to compare
their results, which will help us reach stronger conclusions about whether labels promote smoking cessation.
 The proposed study will provide the strongest research on package inserts to date. The strengths of the
experiment in Study 1 are complemented by the evaluation of insert effects in more natural contexts for
Studies 2a and 2b. Comparison of results across all three studies will help determine how inserts and HWLs
work, including their effects on smoking cessation. The results will be useful for policy making both in the US
and internationally. We will also improve understanding of product labeling, whose low cost and ability to
repeatedly communicate with many people holds great potential for promoting healthy consumer behaviors."

The emerging role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is shifting how the field is
approaching its treatment, with growing interest in the development of immunomodulatory therapeutics. The
appropriate therapeutic window and patient population for such treatment strategies remains to be determined.
Importantly, current understanding of inflammation in AD has largely arose from brain tissues studied in isolation.
However, it has become clear that peripheral inflammatory responses may influence both AD risk and disease
progression. Here, I propose to use whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) of the translocator protein
18kDa (TSPO) and triggering receptor on myeloid cells 1 (TREM1) and complementary immune profiling
techniques to non-invasively assess peripheral and central inflammation in Alzheimer’s disease.
This project aims to use parallel preclinical (Aim 1) and clinical approaches (Aims 2 & 3) to increase the
fundamental understanding of inflammation in disease while actively improving clinical assessment. Our specific
aims are (1) to characterize distinct peripheral and central myeloid cell responses and investigate the effects of
systemic inflammation on neuroinflammation in the 5XFAD mouse model of AD; (2) to develop a clinically
feasible approach to quantify whole-body TSPO-PET uptake in AD patients; and (3) to study whole-body immune
signatures associated with disease severity in AD and mild cognitive impairment patients using whole-body
TSPO-PET and blood-based immune profiling.
The innovation of this work lies in the whole-body approach for the investigation of inflammation in AD, which
has yet to be investigated. TREM1-PET is the first tool to specifically image proinflammatory peripheral myeloid
cells in vivo. Preclinical investigation using TREM1-PET and clinical application of whole-body TSPO-PET
imaging in patients will provide novel insights into the complex neuroimmune interactions involved in AD
pathogenesis. The significance of this work is that enhanced understanding of whole-body innate immune
responses in AD has the potential to not only improve diagnosis and disease monitoring, but also to develop and
screen for effective disease modifying therapeutics. Additionally, these methods can be applied to impact our
understanding of inflammation across a broad range of inflammatory and neurological disorders."

backgrounds and experiences to our program. Trainees will enroll in a two-year program designed to provide
individualized mentoring and training to prepare participants for independent careers as health services
researchers. Training elements will include a strong experiential component of health services and health
systems research content and methods alongside didactic instruction in relevant topics. Improving health equity
and increasing diversity and inclusion will be central themes throughout the program and related curriculum.
Together, trainee-mentorship teams will create individualized development plans focused on the trainee’s areas
of interest and career goals. Trainees will be expected to disseminate their research through publications and
presentations at national conferences, participate in the annual NRSA trainees research conference, and
prepare a competitive research proposal by the end of their program.
The ACCELERATE T32 Program will be led by a team of three experienced principal investigators who are
nationally recognized in health services and health systems research. Three additional co-investigators will
provide supplemental methodological and HSR content expertise. An Advisory Committee comprised of ten
senior HSR leaders from across OSU will provide strategic direction for program development and evaluation.
Unique aspects of ACCELERATE include being anchored in one of the most diverse colleges of medicine in the
country, capitalizing on the unparalleled depth and breadth of academic programs at OSU, focusing on
developing mentorship skills of junior faculty in partnership with experienced senior mentors to build the pipeline
of HSR mentors, and recruiting and training both non-clinician and clinician researchers to study and tackle the
myriad important challenges in HSR. Our goal is to train health services researchers to address the most
pressing issues in healthcare delivery, using data and innovative processes to help people increase their well-
being and access affordable, safe, and effective care throughout their lives."

Maternal mortality in the United States is higher than in peer nations and has not decreased since 1990.
Beyond mortality, severe maternal mortality impacts far too many women. Not only are these high rates
alarming, but notable racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities exist. These inequities are highly regional,
with women living in the rural southeast part of the United States, including the Mississippi Delta, having the
highest rates of maternal mortality and morbidity. Unfortunately, these disparities have proven to be stubbornly
resistant to interventions, necessitating an innovative multifaceted approach focused on community practice,
building trust, and prioritizing patient voices. To meet this need, this proposal aims to establish the JSU-
Mississippi Delta Research Center of Excellence for Maternal Health with the goal of addressing
preventable maternal mortality, decreasing severe maternal morbidity, and promoting maternal health equity in
partnership with the Mississippi Delta community. This research center will conduct two multi-layered research
projects. Research Project 1 will determine the effectiveness of an evidenced-based community health worker
home visiting program grounded in extensive patient and community participation. Research Project 2 will
evaluate the effectiveness of a multilevel and multisectoral communication and health literacy strategy to
increase trust and engagement in postpartum healthcare among women in the Mississippi Delta, with a
specific focus on Black women, their families, and their communities. These research projects both have the
overarching goal of partnering with the community to determine and meet the needs of pregnant and
postpartum women in the Mississippi Delta and address the disparities within maternity care. Supporting the
goals of the research projects, an extensive research training program for early-stage investigators, utilizing
community health partners, will address the interpersonal and structural factors that affect maternal outcomes.
Our Community Partnership Component will ensure a successful, sustained, collaborative working
environment throughout the center with the goal of establishing meaningful and equal community partnerships
throughout the research development process and training. To achieve these objectives, we have brought
together an experienced team with diverse expertise and perspectives, combining knowledge and resources
from Jackson State University, the Mississippi State Department of Health, Six Dimensions (a Mississippi
community-based public health consulting company), the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, and
various community partners. By establishing an equal partnership with the community in all parts of the
process – including integration with clinical practices and hospitals, connection with community resources, and
regular input from patients – we envision that this research center will overcome structural and interpersonal
barriers to high-quality, culturally competent maternal care and ultimately improve maternal morbidity and
mortality for women residing in the Mississippi Delta.

10908734,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Research Project 1 - Community Care Implementation to Reduce Maternal Health
Inequities
As rates of mortality and serious complications during and after childbirth have increased in the United States,
so has the focus on improving the quality of postpartum care to reverse these trends and eliminate
preventable maternal mortality, severe maternal morbidity, and inequities. In recent years, postpartum care
has been recognized as an important aspect of the continuum of women’s healthcare across the life cycle.
Importantly, care during the postpartum period should involve not just a single visit to the gynecologist, but a
series of visits tailored to the needs of the woman. Evidence-based home visiting programs show measurable
improvements in both maternal and newborn outcomes but have yet to show an impact on the persistently
high maternal morbidity and mortality rates and the racial disparities in maternal health care in the Mississippi
Delta. In addition, women in the Mississippi Delta women are more likely to experience postpartum depressive
symptoms and face financial and emotional stressors before and during pregnancy compared with mothers
across the United States. Thus, postpartum care in the Mississippi Delta must encompass clinical health,
mental health, and social support. The proposed postpartum home visiting program – an adapted
multicomponent needs-based postpartum care and follow-up program for high-risk women – will address
these gaps in care. Our program has been tailored to meet the various needs of at-risk mothers in
underserved Mississippi communities. Specifically, evidence-based program elements focus on areas of key
importance: (a) physical well-being and chronic disease management, (b) social work and financial support,
(c) psychological well-being and sleep, and (d) infant care and feeding. Importantly, the proposed program will
expand the postpartum care period beyond a single 6-week postpartum check-up to include a minimum of four
in-person visits (three within 3 weeks of hospital discharge and one visit after 12 weeks to discharge the
mother). Continued care will include further contacts (home visit, phone, text, or telehealth) with the mother,
scheduled by nurse/ community health worker team. Community health workers with understanding of the
community will be essential team members and serve as the primary contact for mothers. This research
project will implement and evaluate the proposed program through the following aims: (1) establish an
adapted multicomponent needs-based postpartum care and follow-up program in Mississippi; (2) evaluate the
effectiveness of the postpartum care and follow-up program in improving uptake, trust, and satisfaction; and
(3) evaluate the effectiveness of the postpartum care and follow-up program in improving clinical and mental
maternal health outcomes and disparities. This research project has the potential to reduce severe maternal
morbidity within populations experiencing the greatest maternal health inequities in Mississippi, supporting the
overall mission of the Mississippi Delta Research Center of Excellence for Maternal Health."
10908735,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Research Project 2 - Empowering Women for Postpartum Care and Reproductive
Health in the Mississippi Delta
Maternal mortality and morbidity remain unacceptably high across the United States, and particularly in the
Mississippi Delta, with Black women experiencing an elevated and unjust risk of loss of life and health.
Evidence supports that engagement in healthcare across the pre- and postpartum continuum can reduce
adverse maternal outcomes. However, barriers to engagement in maternal healthcare persist in the
Mississippi Delta, despite many attempts to intervene. Legacies and current practices of structural and
interpersonal racism have led to distrust of health advocates and healthcare providers among Black women
and their families. Poverty, transportation, lack of health insurance, poor health literacy, and limited availability
of healthcare also contribute to health inequities. To improve access to care and quality of healthcare
services, these structural and interpersonal barriers must be acknowledged and addressed in a
comprehensive manner. In this research project, we propose a multisectoral patient-clinical linkage
intervention to increase comprehension, trust, and engagement in postpartum healthcare among parents in
the Mississippi Delta, with a specific focus on Black women, their families, and their communities. The
intervention will directly address structural and interpersonal barriers to engagement in postpartum healthcare
through (a) improving health literacy and communication skills among community health workers and licensed
clinicians (focusing on skills, written text and oral communication, tasks and activities for services utilization,
and the environment for provision of health services); (b) community health worker care coordination to
facilitate pre- and postpartum visits; and (c) employing strategies to increase insurance utilization postpartum
and defray the costs of attending care. These interconnected research activities aim to reduce structural and
interpersonal barriers to healthcare engagement, thereby empowering postpartum women to seek, advocate
for, and receive the healthcare they deserve. This research project will implement and evaluate the proposed
intervention through the following aims: (1) refine and implement the community-based patient-clinical linkage
intervention and evaluate its effectiveness in increasing maternal health engagement in medical care; (2)
evaluate the effectiveness of the community-based patient-clinical linkage intervention in improving health
literacy and increasing trust; and (3) evaluate the effectiveness of the community-based patient-clinical linkage
intervention in improving reproductive autonomy among postpartum parents in the Mississippi Delta. By
providing concrete support to access information and care, we will connect parents at high risk for adverse
maternal outcomes to quality preventive services. Ultimately, this research project will support the overall
mission of the JSU- Mississippi Delta Research Center of Excellence for Maternal Health to empower
women through increased trust and health literacy while reducing maternal morbidity and mortality in
partnership with the Mississippi Delta community."
10746006,"Project Summary
Little is known about the mechanisms that determine daily rhythms in rest-activity. We recently
found that cells within the motor cortex can be synchronized to daily cycles of glucocorticoids.
We hypothesize that daily suprachiasmatic nucleus activity and corticosterone secretion entrain
circadian rhythms in cortical neurons and astrocytes to regulate daily patterns of behavior. We
will take advantage of new high-throughput, machine learning and the ability to record and
manipulate gene expression and calcium levels in specific cell types in mice. Combining these
methods with two-color, real-time imaging of gene expression simultaneously in neurons and
astrocytes, we will determine the roles of cortical neurons and glial in distinct daily activities."

Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells has shown dramatic
clinical responses in hematologic cancers, with a high proportion of durable complete
remissions elicited in leukemias and lymphomas. This success has led to a strong commercial
investment establishing adoptive cell therapy as a viable clinical therapy and the first licensure
of CAR-T therapy by the FDA in 2017. However, achieving the full promise of CAR-T ACT,
especially in solid tumors, will require further advances in this form of cellular therapy. A key
challenge is maintaining a sufficient pool of functional CAR-T cells in vivo. In addition, even in
hematologic tumors treated effectively with CAR T cells, chemotherapeutic lymphodepletion
regimens with high toxicity are often required to ensure the engraftment and initial expansion of
the donor cells. We recently discovered an efficient strategy for molecularly targeting peptide
vaccines and vaccine adjuvants to lymph nodes, through the use of albumin-binding
phospholipid-polymer linkers conjugated to antigens/molecular adjuvants. Albumin constitutively
traffics from blood to lymph, and serves as an effective chaperone to concentrate these
“amphiphile-vaccine” (amph-vax) components in lymph nodes that would otherwise be rapidly
dispersed in the bloodstream following parenteral injection. However, these lipid-polymer
conjugates also exhibit the property that they insert in cell membranes on arrival in lymph
nodes. We propose here to exploit these dual lymph node targeting and membrane-decorating
properties of amph-vax molecules to create a booster vaccine for CAR T cells, which can be
used to repeatedly expand and rejuvenate CAR-T directly in vivo- in native lymph nodes and/or
tumors. To evaluate this approach in the presence of a complete host immune system, we will
test this concept both with human T cells and with an immunocompetent syngeneic mouse
model of melanoma recently developed by our lab. Our specific aims are to (1) Characterize
the biology of synthetic antigen presentation of amphiphile-ligands from the surface of antigen
presenting cells to CAR T cells in vivo, (2) to demonstrate an amph-vax design generalizable to
any CAR, (3) to evaluate the capacity of a CAR-T vaccine to expand T cells with enhanced
functionality and persistence in vivo, and (4) to test the utility of intratumoral amph-vax delivery
to enhance CAR-T and endogenous T cell priming in tandem. These studies will establish a
robust technology platform to transform multiple aspects of adoptive cell therapy and address
key limitations in existing ACT therapeutic strategies."
10753533,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Recent exome sequencing efforts have implicated alterations that occur within the actin-related proteins (Arps),
ACTL6A and ACTL6B, in both cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders. These highly conserved and tissue-
specific protein paralogues are subunits of multi-component molecular machines that use the energy derived
from ATP hydrolysis to modify chromatin architecture, and hence modulate gene expression. ACTL6A and
ACTL6B are subunits of four major chromatin regulators known to remodel the architecture of chromatin: (1) the
Tip60/NuA4 histone acetyl transferase, and the (2) INO80, (3) SRCAP, and (4) mammalian SWI/SNF
(mSWI/SNF), also called BRG1/BRM Associated Factors (BAF) ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling
complexes. The mSWI/SNF complex has been particularly implicated in a range of neurodevelopmental
disorders and in over 20% of all cancers. However, despite these intriguing genetic studies as well as data
suggesting that Arps are required for proper chromatin regulation, there is very little understanding regarding the
biochemical and genome-wide role of Arps in chromatin remodeling activities. My proposed research plan aims
to further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of disease conferred by mutant ACTL6A and ACTL6B
by identifying functional regions and the biochemical and genome-wide activities of the Arps. Aim 1 investigates
the functional regions and biochemical activities contributed to chromatin remodeling complexes by ACTL6A and
ACTL6B in WT conditions and mutant settings linked with neurodevelopmental disorders. More specifically, Sub-
aim 1A seeks to compare the interactome of the ACTL6 subunits. Sub-aim 1B unbiasedly compares the protein
interactions of WT and mutant ACTL6A/B. Sub-aim 1C focuses on mSWI/SNF complexes to assess their histone
binding and enzymatic activities in WT forms and in those complexes bearing Arps with disease-relevant
mutations. Aim 2 dissects the genome-wide function of the Arps by comparing a WT control to induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) engineered to have disease-relevant mutations. Sub-aim 2A dissects the
chromatin accessibility and gene expression profiles of WT and mutant iPSCs. And, Sub-aim 2B looks at the
genome targeting of the mutant and WT ACTL6 subunits and the four major protein complexes known to bind
them. Successful completion of these aims will provide new insights regarding the interplay of chromatin
remodeling complexes unified by the same family of Arp proteins, define the molecular mechanisms of
ACTL6A/B-binding proteins in normal and disease states, and suggest novel targeted therapeutic approaches
for cancer and intellectual disabilities. The research laboratory of Dr. Cigall Kadoch is the ideal setting to conduct
the disease-oriented research at the interface between biochemistry and functional genomics detailed in this
proposal. Training in state-of-the-art biochemical, enzymatic, and genomic assays, as well as the professional
development Dr. Kadoch provides on scientific communication, networking, leadership, and advocacy will allow
to me to become a capable independent scientist."
10753535,"1 Heart disease is the leading cause of death and a significant health burden to society, in particular myocardial
 2 infarctions are responsible for a large number of premature deaths world-wide. After a cardiac ischemic event,
 3 damaged cells die via necrosis and apoptosis and is replaced by scar tissue. The presence of fibrotic scar tissue
 4 diminishes cardiac function and overtime infarcted hearts undergo failure. Recent studies have shown that a
 5 limited number of spared cardiomyocytes can dedifferentiate and proliferate in response to injury, but this
 6 process fails to sufficiently replace lost cells. However, these studies offer new approaches to stimulate cardiac
 7 repair. One clear obstacle is to understand the how mature mammalian cardiomyocytes are restricted from
 8 proliferation in the adult hearts. Although the mammalian heart shows limited capacity in repair and regeneration,
 9 the adult zebrafish heart is endowed with a robust regenerative response to a variety of injury models. The adult
10 zebrafish heart can efficiently replicate cardiomyocytes, and can stimulate endocardium and coronary vessel
11 regeneration such that damage or lost tissue is completely replaced within weeks. The major goal of this proposal
12 is to understand how the zebrafish heart, specifically cardiomyocytes are activated in response to ventricular
13 injury to dedifferentiate and proliferate. Findings from these studies will provide important factors that are critical
14 for driving completion of cardiomyocyte cell cycle after injury. In preliminary studies, we performed transcriptome
15 profiling (RNA-seq) on ventricular resected hearts and identified a number of genes that are highly expressed
16 following injury. Our studies reveal that one of these genes, the forkhead transcription factor, foxm1 is
17 upregulated in cardiomyocytes that are within the injury border zone. Studies with foxm1 mutant zebrafish
18 showed cardiomyocyte cell cycling was diminished and failure to resolve scar tissue upon ventricular resection.
19 Transcriptome profiling foxm1 mutant hearts show a marked decrease in expression of cell cycle genes involved
20 in G2/M transition suggesting that Foxm1 may be a critical driver of cardiomyocyte cytokinesis. In addition, we
21 have identified candidate foxm1 target genes implicated to be involved in cardiomyocyte differentiation and
22 mitosis. We therefore propose to characterize the molecular control of cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation and
23 proliferation through extensive study of foxm1 and downstream target genes. The findings from these studies
24 will identify new molecular pathways and factors to that have the potential to stimulate repair and regeneration
25 after myocardial infarction to address a societal health burden."
10753541,"SUMMARY:
Identification of host genes and pathways that can block cancer cell engraftment and growth could lead to
revolutionary new cancer treatment strategies. In metastatic cancer, there are many steps in which cancer cells
interact with the host microenvironment: the release of cells from their original location, travel through the
circulation, engraftment into a distant location, and growth in the new environment. So-called liquid tumors
like acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are not often considered to be metastatic, but leukemic cells disseminate
throughout the body and can lead to solid metastasis-like tumors called myeloid sarcomas, interacting with
the host microenvironment in similar ways. In the soft-shell clam (Mya arenaria), and other bivalves, fatal
AML-like cancer lineages have evolved that metastasize repeatedly—not just from a primary to a secondary
site, but from one whole animal to another, over and over again throughout the population for decades or
longer. These fatal contagious cancers exert a strong selective pressure in nature to select for clams which can
block engraftment and growth of this lineage of cancer cells. We will use this unique bivalve transmissible
neoplasia (BTN) system as a model of AML to determine (1) which microenvironments expression patterns
correlate with metastatic growth, (2) what genes correlate with resistance to progression, and (3) how
different populations have evolved resistance to cancer. This study has the potential to provide an
unprecedented understanding of cancer microenvironment and reveal new and important interactions
between cancers and their hosts."

The overall goal of the proposed K43 Emerging Global Leader Award is to support Dr. Stephen Okoboi’s
research training to develop as an independent global health HIV researcher. Dr. Okoboi is currently a
postdoctoral fellow and Deputy Head of Research at Makerere University Infectious Disease Institute in
Uganda. Conducting the proposed studies in this application will facilitate his training goals to: 1) gain
expertise in behavioural science methods to better understand the processes and preventive behaviours
underlying peer delivery of HIV and syphilis self-tests combined with assisted partner notification (APN)
services, 2) gain expertise in the design and conduct of randomized trials in real world settings, and 3) acquire
advanced skills in health economic evaluation. This proposal builds on the unique skills he already has in
epidemiology and nursing while leveraging a multidisciplinary team of mentors to ultimately become a
productive and influential independent investigator in HIV prevention research. The research goal of this
proposal is to conduct a rigorous proof-of-concept evaluation to assess the feasibility, acceptability,
preliminary effectiveness, and cost effectiveness of peer delivered HIV and syphilis self-testing coupled with
assisted partner notification services. Men who engage in sexual relations with other men (MSM) are
disproportionately affected by HIV and syphilis. In Uganda, MSM HIV prevalence is 13.2% versus 4.7% in
similarly aged males, while syphilis prevalence is 8.3% versus 5.8% in males aged 15-64 years. Syphilis and
HIV transmission share common transmission routes and syphilis increases risk of HIV acquisition,
transmission, and disease progression. The World Health Organization recommends dual HIV/syphilis testing
for MSM, but uptake of facility-based testing is low because of stigma and discrimination in healthcare
settings. Differentiated service delivery models, such as peer delivered HIV/syphilis self-tests and linkage to
care for those who test positive, could circumvent health facility stigma and other structural barriers to
accessing care. However, no studies to our knowledge have evaluated the effectiveness of peer delivered
HIV/syphilis self-testing linked to partner services for MSM. To address this research gap, Dr. Okoboi will
conduct formative research to inform the implementation of peer-delivered HIV/syphilis self-tests combined
with APN for Ugandan MSM (Aim 1), conduct a randomized trial to pilot test the preliminary effectiveness of
peer delivered HIV/syphilis self-tests and APN relative to standard of care (Aim 2), and estimate the cost
implications of peer-delivered HIV/syphilis self-testing and APN compared to facility-based testing (Aim 3).
Dr. Okoboi’ s research goals correspond with his training goals, and at the completion of this award, he will
be in an excellent position to submit an R01 application to further advance HIV prevention research for MSM
in sub-Saharan Africa."

For decades, animals in biomedical research have yielded significant scientific and medical breakthroughs by
generating the essential preclinical data that ultimately support the discovery and development of treatments
for human diseases, including cancer. However, while we to rely on animal models to investigate the
complexity of cancer and cancer therapies, these preclinical studies have alarmingly low success in
reproducibility, and even lower preclinical-to-clinical success rates. As per the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals 8th Edition, research institutions have standardized, minimum guidelines for the housing,
husbandry, and overall care for laboratory animals that they must adhere to. A mildly cool ambient
temperature is a critical aspect of animal housing that has been shown to elicit significant physiological
changes to research rodents, driven by the activation of the sympathetic nervous system and increased β-
adrenergic receptor (β-AR) signaling as a result of the systemic release of norepinephrine. This is due to the
compensatory response, known as non-shivering thermogenesis, employed by rodents housed at
temperatures that fall below their thermoneutral zone (which is the range of ambient temperatures at which
heat generated by basal metabolism is sufficient for maintaining homeostatic core temperature. ) Our lab has
previously established that standard (ST), subthermoneutral laboratory housing temperatures result in
significant impairment to the murine CD8+ T cell-dependent anti-tumor immune response compared to mice
house at thermoneutral temperatures (TT). Additionally, we have shown that the immune checkpoint inhibitor
αPD-1, an immunotherapy that has recently seen success as a front-line approach to treating cancers like
melanoma, has improved efficacy in treating tumor-bearing mice housed at TT in a β-AR-dependent manor.
Although published and preliminary data indicate a role for the co-receptor, CD28, in the diminished anti-tumor
function of CD8+ T cells as a result of increased β-AR signaling, a gap exists in our understanding of the
mechanisms underlying the reduced CD8+ T cell activation and effector function in mice housed at ST.
Therefore, we propose using genetically engineered mouse models to precisely interrogate CD28 signaling
and test hypothesis that standard housing temperatures impairs CD8+ T cell anti-tumor immunity and the in
vivo efficacy of αPD-1 via impaired CD28 co-stimulation. We will use in vitro and in vivo approaches to
examine the effects of housing temperature on CD8+ T cell CD28 expression and signaling, as well as tumor-
infiltrating lymphocytes in mice treated with αPD-1 therapy. The studies outline in this proposal have the
potential to identify a previously undefined mechanism by which subthermoneutral laboratory animal housing
temperatures influence experimental outcomes of cancer and immunotherapy models, while also
characterizing a widely underappreciated variable that exists in our animal models."
10904928,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The deterioration of protein homeostasis is a signature of aging cells and underlies the etiology of numerous
aging-related diseases. Proteostasis is normally maintained through a well-coordinated network of factors that
include protein synthesis regulators, molecular chaperones that promote proper folding, quality control and
proteolytic degradation machinery. This proteostasis network serves to prevent the accumulation of misfolded,
non-functional, and aggregated proteins, which is particularly critical during stress and as cells age. Proteins
which function within the proteostasis network are highly-regulated by different mechanisms including their post-
translational modification. The modification lysine methylation has been identified on many factors that contribute
to proteostasis, though the molecular role for methylation within the proteostasis network remains poorly-defined.
The conserved SMYD family of lysine methyltransferases are known to methylate factors important to proteome
integrity, such as chaperones, although their function in maintaining proteostasis is not well-understood. We
have investigated the function of an orphan yeast SMYD lysine methyltransferase, Set6, and determined that it
is a critical regulator of the proteostasis network via its methyltransferase activity. The overarching goal of the
proposed work is to identify the specific regulatory role for Set6 in proteostasis and to define its catalytic activity
on factors important for proteome integrity, including the cytosolic chaperone Hsp70. To address this, we
propose to use a series of molecular and cell biological assays to dissect the molecular contribution of Set6 and
its catalytic activity to the proteostasis network under normal and stress conditions. We will also use quantitative
proteomics, structure-function analysis, and genetic approaches to define regulatory mechanisms directing the
activity of Set6 under normal and stress conditions, with a focus on its protein-protein interactions. Finally, we
will define the molecular consequences of Set6-dependent methylation on Hsp70 using molecular, biochemical,
and genetic approaches, and test the hypothesis that methylation by Set6 alters the Hsp70 interactome during
stress. We will also investigate whether Set6 has additional substrates in the proteostasis network using
biochemical, proteomic, and genetic assays. Altogether, these studies will reveal new regulatory mechanisms
governing the proteostasis network and will advance our understanding of the roles for SMYD enzymes in
proteome integrity. This work will also provide insight into aging-related pathologies characterized by misfolded
or aggregated proteins and may uncover new mechanisms that can be targeted therapeutically to promote
healthy proteostasis as cells age and prevent age-dependent diseases."

Early-life environmental exposures (e.g., social-environmental, parental risk factors, nicotine, diet, infection) are
increasingly implicated in the early pathogenesis of childhood diseases that have life-long consequences.
Mechanisms linking these exposures to longer-term outcomes remain limited. In 2016, the NIH established the
Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Program, a collaborative multi-dimensional
research initiative to characterize the impact of early-life environmental factors on childhood health (>70 cohorts,
>50K participants). While targeted assays within ECHO are likely to lead to disease-specific insight, broad,
comprehensive, unbiased assessment of the molecular space for novel discovery—a key mission of ECHO—
will necessitate centralization of biobanking efforts/laboratory management with capability for high-throughput
“OMICs”/non-“OMICs” assay as well as novel assay development, bioinformatics, and cloud architecture/data
sharing for collaborative science. In response to RFA-OD-22-016, Vanderbilt will address this need by
establishing the ECHO Laboratory Core at Vanderbilt for Integrated Sample Biobanking and Processing
(ELVIS). ELVIS facilitates the collection and processing of biospecimens; manages the biorepository; performs
a wide range of biospecimen assays (including novel development), and coordinates metadata and assay data
transfer to the Coordinating Center. ELVIS is organized in core “resources” to provide leadership/integration to
manage ECHO biobanking, assay performance, and data delivery: (1) administrative/LIMS/biobanking; (2)
metabolomics; (3) proteomics; (4) nucleic acid assessment; (5) metagenomics; (6) bioinformatics/study design.
We are uniquely positioned for this initiative, leveraging Vanderbilt’s unique long-term strategic investment in
functional biobanking and assay: (1) large-scale, reliable biorepository receipt and laboratory management
(“LIMS”) capability (>350K patients currently with biospecimens; many other NIH funded biobanks); (2) nationally
recognized systems for clinical metadata capture (REDCap, REDBrics; used in NIH initiatives, like All of Us); (3)
cutting-edge laboratory cores with capability for novel assay development/validation. We will establish
harmonized protocols and workflow for ECHO cohort biospecimen collection and tracking infrastructure from the
point of sample collection to long-term storage (Aim 1); perform high-quality, well-powered multi-OMICs and
targeted assays to identify molecular correlates of disease trajectories in early life (Aim 2), and provide
comprehensive data management platform to facilitate integrated data analysis (Aim 3). ELVIS is an ideal
mechanism for ECHO given (1) deep, funded experience in handling the requisite sample sizes in banking and
high-throughput assay, including quality assurance measures; (2) prior track record in ECHO to ensure ECHO-
specific metadata collection, curation, and harmonization; (3) secure methods for cloud infrastructure for data
analysis pipelines and data flow to clinical sites and data analysis center. Successful completion will enable the
success of ECHO’s mission to discover molecular underpinnings of early childhood determinants of disease."
10951592,"Abstract. Pain is the clinical hallmark of sickle cell disease (SCD), yet pain management remains inadequate
for many in this population due to lack of evidence-based pain treatment approaches for SCD, and due to
stigma and implicit bias in the healthcare system. Black adolescents and young adults (AYAs, ages 16-30) with
SCD are particularly vulnerable as they endure repeat hospitalizations due to pain crises while coping with
stigma and related stressors, as well as the other challenges of transitioning to adulthood. Opioids are the
primary agent used in chronic SCD pain management, despite evidence that they provide poor long-term relief
and lead to negative physical and psychological consequences. Psychosocial interventions that teach cognitive
and behavioral strategies can simultaneously reduce pain and stigma and enhance mood in patients with SCD.
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the primary behavioral health approach to managing pain in the general
population, and digital CBT has expanded its accessibility. In SCD and other minority populations, we have
demonstrated that a low-cost, scalable, technology-delivered version of CBT is feasible and can be effective
for addressing stress and pain. We have learned that personalized support can improve engagement with
digital CBT. We will now test a personalized approach customized for AYAs with SCD using peer support
delivered through community-based organizations (CBOs). We will conduct a multisite, randomized controlled
trial of digital CBT to understand the level of support needed to achieve benefits for reducing pain and stigma.
Our Peer suppoRt for adolescents and Emerging adults with Sickle cell pain: promoting ENgagement in
Cognitive behavioral thErapy (PRESENCE) study aims to reduce pain, opioid use, and healthcare utilization
among AYAs with SCD. During the UG3 phase, we will leverage an established infrastructure for delivering
virtual peer support interventions, existing digital CBT programs tailored by and for people with SCD, and
partnerships with CBOs to jointly refine the study design, digital CBT content, and peer support component and
work with the HEAL ERN CCC and DCC to prepare for the UH3 trial. After meeting UG3 milestones and
transitioning to the UH3 phase, we will randomize 470 AYAs with frequent pain (³4 days/wk) over the past ³3
months to one of 3 treatment groups: 1) a digital CBT program with weekly one-on-one peer support provided
via text and/or telephone based on participant preference (CBT+peer), 2) the same digital CBT program
without peer support (self-guided CBT), or 3) usual care (UC). We first hypothesize that AYAs receiving either
digital CBT treatment (CBT+ peer or self-guided CBT) will have better pain and mental health outcomes than
AYAs receiving UC at 6 months. Second, we hypothesize that CBT+peer will be associated with improved
program engagement and pain and mental health outcomes at 6 months compared with self-guided CBT. The
PRESENCE trial will determine effectiveness of digital CBT for pain management among AYAs with SCD, a
critical step toward future wide-scale deployment as part of routine SCD care."
10884296,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are biologic drugs that have revolutionized cancer treatment by targeting
specific inhibitory receptors, or their ligands, on T lymphocytes and thereby restoring immune system
surveillance. Despite significant improvements in therapeutic responses, ICIs cause ‘immune-related adverse
events’ (irAEs). ICI-induced immune-mediated damage to the kidneys exhibits two phenotypes including
glomerulonephritis and acute kidney injury with interstitial nephritis. These kidney toxicities were not anticipated
in preclinical testing but now occur in patients receiving ICIs, at a mean of 3 months of therapy. Within 5 years
of receiving ICI therapy, new onset chronic kidney disease and declines in glomerular filtration rate have been
observed in 20% of cancer patients. Several issues mask our understanding of ICI nephrotoxicity: 1) the ability
to predict which patients will exhibit the toxicity, 2) how to sensitively detect subclinical injury prior to significant
elevations in serum creatinine, and 3) poorly elucidated relationships between drug disposition, the immune
system, kidney biology, and antitumor responses to inform nephrotoxicity mechanisms. There is an urgent need
to develop preclinical models and assessments that can inform irAEs as ICIs are becoming the primary
therapeutics for some cancers. This proposal will advance a novel mouse cancer model with a humanized
immune system to identify mechanisms of kidney immunotoxicities associated with ICIs. Pharmacological
interventions will evaluate the contributions of 1) tumor type, 2) drug exposure kinetics, 3) on-target versus off-
target responses, and 4) human CD8+ and CD4+ lymphocyte signaling, in the mouse model of ICI nephrotoxicity.
The animal model will bridge preclinical testing and clinical practice, in that the proposal will also evaluate cancer
patients prescribed ICI biologics for kidney toxicities. For patients, mechanistic evaluations will be performed
using quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) and pharmacokinetic approaches. The central hypothesis of
this proposal is that a novel humanized animal model recapitulates the renal pathology observed
clinically with ICIs, and in combination with human biospecimens from cancer patients prescribed ICIs
and novel QSP modeling can inform relationships between drug disposition, the immune system and
kidney biology, antitumor responses, and nephrotoxicity to understand mechanisms of ICI renal irAEs.
The proposal consists of two independent Specific Aims to systematically evaluate kidney irAEs in an animal
model and clinical patients receiving ICIs. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in clinical
oncology, nephrology, immunology, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling, proteomics, and
toxicology across two NCI-designated cancer centers to complete the proposed studies. The proposed research
has high translational impact due to the current unmet need to predict, detect, and monitor kidney injury caused
by ICIs and other immunomodulatory drugs with the goal of preventing long-term chronic kidney disease."
10746122,"Higher eukaryotes evolved with mechanisms that initiate DNA replication at multiple origins on multiple
chromosomes. Activation of the replicative helicase at a single origin in each of ~50,000 replicons is sufficient
to replicate the human genome in the absence of stress. These ~50,000 origins are selected from a five- to
tenfold excess of licensed origins. Activation of additional replicative helicases at origins that would otherwise
be passively replicated is observed after stress. This plasticity in origin use is a simple mechanism to recover
DNA replication between stalled and collapsed replication forks. The mechanism(s) that limits origin firing to one
per replicon in the absence of stress is not known. We recently reported that the DNA damage signaling kinases
ATR and Chk1 inhibit activation of the replicative helicase in the absence of stress. In preliminary studies, we
show that Chk1 kinase activity is strictly associated with ATR kinase-dependent phosphorylations on Chk1 and
that these have an astonishingly short half-life in cells. We propose that this is a highly innovative mechanism
that localizes Chk1 kinase activity to the immediate vicinity of ATR at active replicative helicases. We also show
that Rif1, which has been implicated in the regulation of replication timing previously, is phosphorylated and that
phosphorylated Rif1 binds protein phosphatase 1α (PP1α). Based upon these findings, we hypothesize that
Chk1 kinase activity generates a ring of Rif1-PP1α around active replicative helicases and that this limits Cdc7
kinase-dependent origin firing across a replicon. In Aim 1 we will investigate a new mechanistic paradigm for
localizing DNA damage signaling to a small volume of the nucleus in the absence of stress. In Aim 2 we will
investigate the molecular mechanism that limits activation of the replicative helicase across a replicon in the
absence of stress. In Aim 3 we will investigate the impact of ATR kinase inhibition and conformal radiation on
immune responses in tumor bearing mice. These studies are highly impactful as they will identify a fundamental
mechanism that determines inter-origin distance, genome stability and the rate of cell division in higher
eukaryotes. Since this mechanism may be attenuated in T cells, these studies will provide fundamental insights
into adaptive immune responses. Our studies may have an immediate impact as the ATR and Chk1 kinase
inhibitors used here are in clinical trials."
10746130,"Excessive sugar and fat consumption can lead to a range of metabolic abnormalities including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hypercholesterolemia, dyslipidemia, obesity, and insulin resistance. Emerging evidence points to a new mechanism linking carbon metabolism and fatty liver disease to the G protein-coupled Protease Activated Receptor-2 (PAR2), a receptor previously known to be involved in inflammation. To provide key support for the potential importance of hepatic PAR2 in humans, in a cross-sectional study of liver specimens and clinical data from 108 NAFLD patients and controls, we found that PAR2 protein expression in hepatocytes was low in control livers and progressively increased in patients with mild NAFLD fibrosis and in NAFLD with higher stages of fibrosis. The high PAR2-expressing NAFLD patient cohort had significantly elevated plasma LDL cholesterol as compared to the low PAR2-expressing cohort. However, a definitive role for PAR2 in metabolism, cholesterol homeostasis, and liver pathology remains unknown. The overarching goal of this grant proposal is to examine the role of PAR2 signaling in the etiology and pathogenesis of fatty liver disease to test our central hypothesis that hepatic PAR2 is a novel contributor of hypertriglyceridemia, obesity, and insulin resistance. PAR2 is expressed by many tissues and cell types and a conventional mouse whole-body knockout (KO) has been used to date. Therefore, it is unclear how much of the KO phenotype or effects of PAR2 inhibition on steatosis, lipid metabolism, and weight loss is mediated only at the level of the hepatocyte and how much is due to loss of PAR2 at other sites of expression. We will use our new hepatocyte-specific PAR2-KO, PAR2∆Hep mice to define and validate the specific involvement of liver PAR2 in these profound metabolic effects in aims 1-3. It is unclear how PAR2 promotes insulin resistance in diet-induced obesity models. Aim 2 will explore a novel mechanism whereby PAR2 activates a Gq-PLC pathway to stimulate calcium flux and CaMKK2 to interfere in insulin activation of AKT-glucose signaling. To explain our preliminary data that global PAR2-deficiency lowers basal plasma glucose, but increases liver glucose and glycogen in both lean and obese mouse models, Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that hepatocyte PAR2 suppresses the major liver glucose transporter GLUT2 through a mechanism potentially involving Gq-MAPK-FoxA3. Aims 1-3 will utilize our pepducin technology developed to allosterically target G-protein coupled receptors on the inside surface of the plasma membrane to help delineate specific PAR2-effector signaling pathways in aberrant liver metabolism and insulin resistance in vitro and in vivo."
10746438,"Project Summary: The mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system is composed of DA neurons in the ventral
tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra compacta (SNc). It is well studied that DA neurons project
to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in mediation of reinforcement learning and reward. But the
physiological role of dopamine in specific control of appetite and the underlying neural circuit remain
elusive. To assess input-specific effects of motivational feeding behaviors, we employ a
multidisciplinary approach combining in vivo optogenetics, in vivo electrophysiology, viral-based
circuit tracing, and various behavioral paradigms. We identify a novel VTA-PBN neural circuit that
plays a pivotal role in control of appetitive and consummatory feeding. Here we suggest a novel
neural mechanism by which a subset of PBN-projecting DA and GABA neurons controls feeding and
body weight. We further identify a group of PBN neurons as the post-synaptic targets of the VTA
neurons that uniquely contribute to feeding and food-conditioned behavior. This project advances a
novel concept that a genetically distinguishable VTA-PBN neural circuit selectively and differentially
mediates appetitive response and consummatory feeding under distinct nutritional and cognitive
states."

Sepsis, or life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection, is a critical
public health issue. Affecting nearly 50 million people annually, sepsis is a leading cause of death worldwide,
and significantly impacts the global economy. A major reason for the substantial burden of sepsis is an
insufficient understanding of the biologic mechanisms that potentiate its pathogenesis. One of the hallmarks of
sepsis is endothelial injury, which manifests as endothelial barrier hyperpermeability and results in organ
dysfunction including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A known contributor to the disruption of
endothelial barrier integrity in sepsis is cell-free hemoglobin (CFH), hemoglobin released into the circulation
from lysed red blood cells. CFH is elevated in the majority of patients with sepsis and is associated with higher
rates of organ dysfunction, such as ARDS, and death. This proposal seeks to define the pathophysiologic role
of CFH in endothelial hyperpermeability in sepsis. A primary regulator of endothelial permeability is the
endothelial glycocalyx, a matrix of glycoproteins and proteoglycans that lines the vascular lumen. In sepsis,
this function is impaired due to increased activity of heparanase, an enzyme that degrades the endothelial
glycocalyx. Importantly, greater glycocalyx breakdown correlates with worse sepsis outcomes. Given that
heparanase expression is, in part, modulated by transcription factors that are stimulated by reactive oxygen
species (ROS), and that CFH undergoes oxidation in the inflammatory environment of sepsis, producing ROS
including superoxide in the process, I hypothesize that CFH-generated superoxide triggers glycocalyx
cleavage via induction of heparanase expression, thereby serving as a critical mediator of endothelial
hyperpermeability and consequent organ injury in sepsis. I will test the effect of CFH on the pulmonary
endothelial glycocalyx using mechanistic approaches in both cultured primary human lung microvascular
endothelial cells and murine polymicrobial sepsis. Both models will be used to accomplish each Aim. In Aim 1,
I will determine the impact of superoxide and CFH on glycocalyx degradation, endothelial barrier function, and
sepsis-associated lung injury, severity, and mortality. Aim 2 will define the role of CFH in the modulation of
heparanase expression and activity. I will also interrogate whether alterations in heparanase expression and
activity affect endothelial barrier permeability and sepsis outcomes. Finally, I will delineate the impact of CFH-
generated superoxide on heparanase expression and activity to complete my investigation of this proposed
pathway. In resolving the role of CFH in glycocalyx degradation and endothelial dysfunction, I will deliver
unprecedented insights into the consequences of elevated circulating CFH during sepsis, with potential to
unveil new approaches to the development of therapeutics for the treatment of sepsis-associated lung injury.
Furthermore, the completion of this project will facilitate the development of my technical, critical thinking, and
communication skills that will be crucial to my success as an independent physician-scientist."
10893977,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Opioid addiction is pervasive and widespread, affecting roughly three million U.S. adults. Currently available
opioid addiction treatments, such as opioid replacement therapy, fail to slow the growing opioid pandemic and
maintain the risk of addiction and overdose. Moreover, available opioid addiction treatments require long-term
commitment to treatment with little evidence of long-lasting abstinence. Lastly, opioid replacement therapy is
unable to alleviate addiction-induced cognitive impairments. A deeper understanding of the neural and
cognitive systems that underlie addiction is necessary for the development of better targeted treatments for
opioid addiction.
The rodent model of opioid addiction exhibits behavioral markers analogous to those induced in human opioid
addiction. Hence, this is a reliable and feasible model for studies of the neural correlates of addiction-related
maladaptive behaviors. An emerging body of research suggests that the evolutionarily conserved lateral
habenula in rodents is highly implicated in addiction. The lateral habenula is unique in that it directly regulates
dopaminergic and serotonergic structures, both of which exhibit dysfunction in addiction. However, with
traditional electrophysiological methods of recording lateral habenula neural activity, it has been difficult to
clearly assess responses of large populations of neurons. More recent advances in imaging technology have
allowed for week-long monitoring of individual neuron calcium dynamics, easing the feasibility of studying the
lateral habenula neural responses. Serotonin agonists, such as psilocybin, have shown promising results in
reducing the rates of relapse in alcohol and nicotine addiction and improving cognitive function in unhealthy
adults. Importantly, lateral habenula hyperactivity is known to drive aversion and is present in withdrawal.
Serotonergic agonists have also been shown to quiet lateral habenula activity, suggesting a potential
unexplored treatment avenue.
Hence, with the use of calcium imaging, I hypothesize that lateral habenula neuron dynamics will shift to a
hyperactive state following morphine withdrawal, and that these neural signatures will correlate with
decreased performance on cognitive tasks. Additionally, I hypothesize that psilocybin treatment will reinstate
baseline lateral habenula activity and improve cognitive performance. The proposed series of experiments will
fill the gap in understanding the neural circuitry that drives maladaptive decisions during opiate withdrawal, as
well as the behavioral and neural effect of a novel treatment for opiate addiction."

Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), which accounts for approximately 85% of all renal cancers, is resistant
to a variety of cancer therapies and is highly lethal. von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) is the most important tumor
suppressor in renal cancer, its loss leads to hypoxia inducible factor α (HIFα, including HIF1α and HIF2α)
accumulation. Although HIF2α inhibitor has been developed as a potential therapeutic target in renal cancer,
only a small propotion of patients will respond to HIF2α inhibitore treatment, suggesting the importance of
identifying additional therapeutic vulnerabilities in VHL-deficient kidney cancer. Our recently published work
demonstrated that VHL loss activates TANK Binding Kinase 1 (TBK1), which plays a critical role in tumor cell
proliferation, tumor growth and spontaneous metastasis. Targeting TBK1 inhibits VHL-deficient cancer cell
growth while leaving VHL restored cells unaffected. While TBK1 is involved in innate immune signaling and
phosphorylates the transcription factor IRF3, we did not observe p-IRF3 (or type I interferon production) in VHL-
deficient cancers suggesting alternate functions for TBK1 in ccRCC. Thus, TBK1 is a promising therapeutic
target. However, currently available inhibitors lack specificity and may impair innate immunity. Identification of
TBK1 regulators in ccRCC may lead to development of more specific inhibitors that preserve TBK1 function in
other compartments (i.e. immune cells). Through a kinome-wide siRNA screen, we identified Doublecortin Like
Kinase 2 (DCLK2) as a potential TBK1 activator. DCLK2 depletion by multiple siRNAs decreased TBK1
phosphorylation and protein levels. Conversely, overexpression of DCLK2 induced TBK1 phosphorylation both
in vitro and in vivo. While DCLK2 was reported to promote growth cone reformation after optic nerve injury, a
role for DCLK2 in cancer is unexplored. Our preliminary data show that DCLK2 depletion reduced ccRCC cell
proliferation, colony formation and xenograft tumor growth. We hypothesize that the DCLK2-TBK1 regulatory
node serves as a novel signaling axis in ccRCCs with VHL loss that could be exploited therapeutically.
This is the first study to characterize the role of DCLK2 in cancer. In addition, TBK1 is the first known DCLK2
kinase substrate in cancer. In Specific Aim 1, we will characterize the functional significance of DCLK2 in kidney
cancer. In Specific Aim 2, we will delineate the molecular mechanism by which DCLK2 contributes to kidney
tumorigenesis. In Specific Aim 3, we will investigate the therapeutic potential of targeting DCLK2-TBK1 in kidney
cancer ortothopic xenografts and patient derived xenografts (PDXs) available through UT Southwestern Kidney
Cancer Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE). Successful completion of these aims will provide
mechanistic insight into a novel signaling pathway and set the foundation for therapeutic interventions targeting
the DCLK2-TBK1 axis in ccRCC."

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related deaths worldwide, demonstrating the pressing need for
effective and lasting treatments. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, which block negative regulators of T cell function,
have the potential to generate lasting responses in lung cancer patients. However, only a minority of patients
respond to these therapies and ~50% of patients whose tumors initially respond to therapy eventually
develop acquired resistance. Clinical studies have identified correlations between tumor non-synonymous
mutation burden and response to immune checkpoint inhibitors across multiple cancer types. However, most
existing pre-clinical mouse models of lung cancer do not recapitulate the complexity of mutational landscapes in
human cancers, and importantly, the tumors in these models do not respond to immune checkpoint inhibition.
Due in part to the lack of available models, mechanisms of primary and acquired resistance to immune
checkpoint inhibition in lung cancer are not fully understood and strategies to overcome resistance are
lacking. To address this challenge, we developed novel orthotopic mouse models of Kras mutant lung
adenocarcinoma that recapitulate features of human disease essential for studying tumor-immune interactions,
including the tumor mutational landscape as well as responsiveness and acquired resistance to immune
checkpoint inhibition. Using these novel models of murine lung cancer, my goal is to investigate mechanisms of
resistance to these new widely-used lung cancer therapies (F99 phase). I will test the overarching hypothesis
that diverse genetic alterations and transcriptional programs resulting in antigen presentation defects and
neoantigen loss are major mechanisms of acquired resistance to ICIs and that these drive the emergence of
tumor-cell extrinsic features of resistance in the tumor microenvironment. I will investigate the spectrum of
genetic and transcriptional drivers of acquired resistance, focusing on defects in antigen processing and
presentation (Aim 1.2.A). I will also investigate whether neoantigen loss can mediate acquired resistance in lung
cancer (Aim 1.2.B). As a post-doc (K00 phase), I plan to work on approaches to improve immunotherapies for
lung cancer to expand their benefits to a broader patient population than those who currently benefit, specifically
by investigating the efficacy of personalized neoantigen vaccines that induce tissue resident memory T cells
(Aim 2). The aims described here will identify drivers of resistance to checkpoint therapy and explore methods
to use neoantigen vaccines in patients that currently do not benefit from approved immunotherapies, yielding
strategies to expand immunotherapy benefits to a broader patient pool."
10750948,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This project will test the hypothesis that DNA damage in cardiomyocytes activates p53 leading to mitochondrial
alterations and secretion of paracrine factors that drive heart failure. The premise for this has been established
from our preliminary data and from the work of others. First, DNA damage and activated DNA damage response
(DDR) have been observed in cardiovascular disease (CVD) in humans. Second, studies also show evidence
that multiple cell types in the cardiac unit, including cardiomyocytes (CM) and cardiac fibroblasts (CF) display
markers of DNA damage and cellular senescence in several disease pathologies. Third, we have recently
identified that nuclear DNA damage drives dilated cardiomyopathy. Specifically, cardiomyocyte-depletion of the
DNA repair endonuclease, ERCC1-XPF in mice, upregulates the DNA damage response gene, p53, and leads
to irregular mitochondrial cristae, accumulation of lipids and increased oxidative stress. Additionally, there is an
increase in several cardiac failure and senescence associated markers. However, the exact molecular
underpinnings and cell-specificity of these DNA damage-induced changes is poorly understood. One barrier to
addressing this question in vivo has been lack of appropriate tools, where DNA damage can be introduced in
only one cell type (e.g., CM) and its effect on CF and cardiac function can be investigated. Additionally, 2D cell
culture and co-culture systems fall short, as they cannot reproduce tissue dynamics present in a cardiac unit.
Herein, we have developed several tools enable the study of cell-cell communication of 3D multicellular system.
Specific Aim 1 will map the molecular, functional, and architectural changes upon loss of ERCC1 in CM. In this
aim, we will test the mechanistic role of p53 and reactive oxygen species on a number of cellular and
mitochondrial parameters, as well as cardiomyocyte electrophysiology. Specific Aim 2 will test whether
stochastic, spontaneous DNA damage in the CM or CF drives cardiac electromechanical dysfunction in a cell-
autonomous or cell non-autonomous manner through a paracrine effect on neighboring cells. Here, we will
analyze the pathological secretome upon genotoxic stress, as well as test the role of eliminating senescent cells
on cardiac health. This work is technically innovative as it uses a number of unique tools including concomitant
optical and bioelectrical measurements in 3D cardiac organoids. These contributions will be significant because
DNA damage is unavoidable and intimately linked to cardiac health and disease. Our team is uniquely qualified
to perform this work, with expertise in DNA damage/ repair, cellular senescence, nanofabrication, human iPSC-
derived cardiac tissue engineering, and data science. This analysis, we believe, will increase our fundamental
understanding of the connection between DNA damage and heart disease and potentially pave the way for new
treatment strategies."

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major cause of patient morbidity and mortality and appears to be a substantial risk
factor for future progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD). According to NIDDK statistics, roughly 14% of
Americans exhibit indications of CKD and 20% of all Medicare spending goes towards it management. Slowing
AKI-to-CKD progression, or identifying those patients most at risk for future CKD following AKI, is currently not
possible largely due to a fundamental gap in understanding of the pathogenesis of AKI-to-CKD transition.
Inflammation-associated lymphangiogenesis (LAG) is critical in regulating inflammation through fluid,
macromolecule (cytokines and antigens), and immune cell transport. While LAG has been identified in a host of
kidney diseases, reports have been mostly correlative. The long-term goal is to identify the mechanisms by
which lymphatics regulate tissue biology in chronic inflammatory disease. The overall objective in this
application is to identify the roles of the renal lymphatic vasculature during kidney injury and exploit the induction
of enhanced LAG as a potential therapy. The central hypothesis is that increasing renal lymphatics provides a
route of immune cell clearance while also potentially regulating solute transport. Guided by strong preliminary
data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine how renal LAG affects
inflammation and renal function in AKI; and 2) Determine the mechanisms by which renal LAG reduces AKI-to-
CKD progression; and 3) Determine the impact of enhancing renal lymphatic density on CKD. Under the first
aim, 3 models of AKI with diverse pathophysiologies will be used to identify how lymphatic density changes with
AKI and whether expanding lymphatics using KidVD mice, a genetic model of kidney-specific LAG, can limit the
AKI inflammatory response. Preliminary data suggest increased LAG protects against AKI. In the second aim,
how LAG alters the progression of AKI-to-CKD will be determined. Additionally, how changes in interstitial
pressures and mineral metabolism in the kidney with increased LAG during sodium and phosphate challenge
may provide a novel mechanism for AKI protection. For the third aim, therapeutic strategies to induce LAG once
CKD is established will be tested in each of the 3 renal pathologies. The proposed research is innovative, in the
applicant’s opinion, because it addresses and specifically targets the lymphatic vasculature of the kidney to
improve kidney function and inflammation upon AKI. New potential therapies and biomarkers are expected to
result from this work. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to identify previously unknown
mechanisms of kidney inflammatory regulation and transport functions. Ultimately, understanding the
mechanisms by which lymphatic vessels regulate kidney function and health has the potential to be
transformative to AKI response and treatment and in remediating the current epidemic of incurable chronic
kidney disease."
10904677,"Antibiotic resistance is a growing world problem and thus there is an urgent need to develop alternative means
to disable such pathogens. One target is the biosynthetic pathway of bacterial glycoconjugates, a diverse class
of macromolecules that play pivotal roles in cell-wall stability in challenging environments and in mediating
bacterial pathogen-host interactions. Structural information about the enzymes involved in the en bloc
construction of the glycoconjugates is lacking, which limits mechanism-based inhibitor design. This proposal
focuses on determining the structure-function relationships of the N-linked glycosylation pathway, because of
the high conservation of the pathway amongst the different pathogenic Campylobacter bacterium. The
glycosyltransferase PglI catalyzes the final step in glycan synthesis through attachment of a branching glycan to
the undecaprenyl phosphate-linked glycopolymer substrate. The branching position of the sugar varies widely
amongst the different species of Campylobacter and the mode of action of PglI is not known. PglI has an
annotated N-terminal GT-A fold domain and a C-terminal domain of unknown function. The additional domain
may play a role in controlling the location of the branching glycan by shaping the active site for acceptor sugar
binding and divalent cation binding and by mediating protein-protein or membrane-associate interactions. Aim 1
will identify the structural basis of selective glycan transfer in PglI enzymes through structural characterization of
PglI from several different Campylobacter species. Aim 2 will focus on determining the catalytic mechanism of
selective glycan transfer of PglI enzymes by kinetic characterization and mutagenesis studies. Aim 3 will focus
on the discovery of novel multidomain glycan biosynthetic enzymes through structural and functional profiling of
the GT-A fold superfamily. This aim will explore the structural space of GT-A fold enzymes by combining
bioinformatics with substrate screening and structural characterization. The structural characterization of PglI
will lead to an understanding of the mechanistic basis for branching glycan attachment in different Campylobacter
species, enabling structure-based design of inhibitors and ultimately new antibiotics. The results of this work will
advance the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that organize the multiprotein complexes of bacterial
glycoconjugate biosynthesis and allow for novel approaches for identifying chemical agents that disrupt these
pathogens."

The United States spends more on maternity care than any other high-income country yet has rising rates of
severe maternal morbidity and mortality. Among other high-income countries, the U.S. ranks as the worst in
maternal morbidity and mortality rates. Moreover, there are significant disparities in severe maternal morbidity
and mortality, with Black pregnant people in the U.S. being more likely than white people to experience severe
maternal morbidity and mortality. Pregnant Black people are also disproportionately impacted by cumulative life
trauma, which is a life course social determinant of health (SDoH) strongly associated with poor perinatal
outcomes. One largely unexplored link between trauma and poor pregnancy outcomes in Black birthing people
is epigenetic changes in physiologic systems that are integral to both labor initiation and parturition and human
response to trauma. Among these are the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis), oxytocinergic
system, and inflammatory response system function which have all been noted to have changes associated
with trauma exposure and play a role in parturition. The purpose of this NRSA fellowship is to utilize an
adapted allostatic load model to evaluate the effects of trauma on labor outcomes, through an epigenome wide
association study of DNA methylation, and its subsequent association with labor outcomes. We will leverage
biologic samples and survey data already being collected from two prospective cohorts (R011NR019254: PI
Dr. Nicole Carlson and R01MH115174: PI Dr. Vasiliki Michopoulos) of Black pregnant people living in the same
geographic area. We plan to evaluate if cumulative life trauma, as reported in early pregnancy, is associated
with labor dysfunction, including long labor duration and unplanned cesarean section. We theorize that trauma-
associated epigenetic changes may provide a missing link connecting Black pregnant people’s trauma
exposure with labor outcomes, thus providing insight into ways to optimize perinatal care for this population to
reduce racial inequities in labor outcomes. This project also includes a comprehensive training plan designed
to prepare a nurse-midwife clinician to be an independent research scientist with expertise in epigenetics,
trauma, and perinatal disparities research."

The microtubule cytoskeleton serves many critical functions in the cell, and its dysfunction is linked to a plethora
of diseases from cancer to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. Post-translational modifications (PTM)
of the tubulin subunits of microtubules are key regulators of both structure and function of microtubules. Similar
to the “Histone Code”, the “Tubulin Code” hypothesis posits microtubule function is tuned through the
incorporation of specific tubulin isoforms and PTMs. Methylation is well known as a common PTM on histones,
however, the function of tubulin methylation and the enzymatic machinery that “reads, writes and erases” this
PTM on microtubules has been largely unexplored. We have identified a new role for the histone-
methyltransferase NSD3 as a tubulin methyltransferase that di-methylates -tubulin at lysines 96 and 112 (the
K96me2 and K112me2 marks). I am exploring the in vivo role of these new methyl marks on -tubulin utilizing
the model organism C. elegans. I have now discovered the NSD3 orthologue in the worm, mes-4, has a somatic
role in neurons, leading me to hypothesize loss of mes-4 abrogates α-tubulin methylation at K96 and K112,
resulting in defects in organization and function of the neuronal cytoskeleton. To test this hypothesis in Aim1 I
will explore the function of K96me2 and K112me2 in the worm utilizing methyl-deficient knockin tubulin mutations
to understand how lack of methylation at these sites impacts microtubule structure (Aim1.1) and dynamics
(Aim1.2). In Aim 2, I will further determine if loss of mes-4 causes loss of K96me2 and/or K112me2 using imaging
and biochemical techniques (Aim2.1-2.2). Studies exploring the role of these methyl marks using loss of function
approaches will be complemented by mes-4 gain of function studies (Aim 2.3). Many human cancers are driven
by mutations that over/constitutively activate NSD3. I will generate a mes-4 mutant worm carrying the same
mutation at the corresponding (conserved) site in C. elegans seen in human cancers, to ask if mes-4 hyperactivity
induces cytoskeletal and functional deficits. My doctoral dissertation will thoroughly investigate a new
perspective on how epigenetic machinery regulates the cytoskeleton, with far reaching implications for
understanding the many diseases linked to cytoskeletal defects."

This proposal aims to improve the patient-specific Computed Tomography (CT)-derived modeling of
transcranial focused ultrasound by comparing acoustic and thermal simulations to hydrophone scans of
excised skull flaps and clinical magnetic resonance thermometry (MRTI) from Essential Tremor (ET)
thalamotomy treatments. Magnetic resonance-guided transcranial focused ultrasound (tMRgFUS) is a non-
invasive therapeutic modality used to treat a wide variety of neurological disorders. tMRgFUS relies on tightly
focusing the ultrasound beam through the inhomogeneous human skull. A fundamental challenge is accurately
determining the acoustic properties of the skull to phase-compensate for the inhomogeneities. Furthermore,
acoustic parameters such as speed of sound c and attenuation α may change with increased temperature,
causing further defocusing. Inaccurate acoustic parameters can result in off-target heating, longer treatment
times, and failed treatments.
This project will improve the focusing of ultrasound through the human skull by accurately determining
individual skull acoustic parameters. The Hybrid Angular Spectrum (HAS) beam simulation method and the
Pennes bioheat equation can simulate pressure fields and thermal rises by mapping acoustic and thermal
parameters to CT Hounsfield Units. The results of these simulations may be compared to experimental data to
determine the accuracy of tFUS acoustic and thermal modeling. Applying this method in reverse, a surrogate
optimization algorithm, which excels at black-box expensive optimization problems, will be used to iteratively
adjust simulation parameters to fit experimental data using a cost function. Aim I will determine the relationship
of the acoustic properties of bone to CT Hounsfield Units. An optimization algorithm will iteratively adjust the
acoustic parameter mapping such that a cost function comparing simulated and measured transmitted acoustic
pressures is minimized. The resulting optimal acoustic parameters accurately model transcranial acoustic
transmission. Aim II will determine the cause of reduced treatment efficiency with high acoustic powers during
tMRgFUS. An optimization algorithm will iteratively adjust the acoustic and thermal parameters to minimize a
cost function comparing simulation to MRTI data from clinical ET Thalamotomy patients.
This work will improve acoustic modeling through the human skull, which is the first step in improving
transcranial focused ultrasound therapy. According to the Focused Ultrasound Foundation, tMRgFUS could be
applied to at least 34 neurological disorders. Thus, this work could have a magnified effect, significantly
reducing morbidity and mortality across the field of neurology."

Despite the high prevalence of chronic pain and disability due to osteoarthritis (OA), there currently is no
effective treatment available to stop progression or manage pain long term. Patients often report ceasing
activities they found previously enjoyable or avoiding activities required for daily living due to the highly
mechanosensitive nature of OA pain. Our understanding of OA has evolved from a wear and tear mindset to a
complex disease state involving the immune and neurological systems, indeed there is an increase in immune
cells and inflammatory mediators within the synovial fluid of humans and mice. Further in mice we see an
increase in macrophages in knee innervating dorsal root ganglia (DRG); prevention of macrophage
recruitment, by macrophage depletion or nociceptor silencing, has shown promise in reducing OA pain like
behaviors. Interestingly, mice with Piezo2, a mechanically activated ion channel, knocked out from nociceptors
demonstrate a reduction in pain behavior in two models of joint pain and are protected from joint swelling.
Within animal modeling of OA there is evidence of altered neuroplasticity and sensitization that is attenuated
by anti-nerve growth factor (NGF) therapy and through inhibition of Piezo2 suggesting an interplay between
mechanical stimuli and inflammation in neuroplasticity. Unloading has been shown to silence mechanical
signal transduction, decrease the expression of harmful proteases in the knee and is more effective in reducing
synovitis than combination treatment with NSAIDs. However, no study has assessed the effect of unloading on
pain associated neuroplasticity. We believe that mechanical signaling is a key player in macrophage
recruitment and sensitization in OA, specifically through Piezo2. Therefore, our central hypothesis is:
mechanical stimuli are necessary for joint neuroplasticity and inflammatory mechanical sensitization and by
inhibiting mechanotransduction we will effectively reduce immune cell recruitment, abhorrent neuroplasticity
and thus pain. Aim 1 will assess the effectiveness of inhibition of mechanical stimuli through Piezo2CKO in
reducing immune cell recruitment to the knee and DRG. Aim 2 will tease apart the interplay of mechanical
loading and inflammation in pain associated neuroplasticity by mechanically unloading mice to determine if
altered neuroplasticity occurs under experimental pain conditions. This project will provide me the opportunity
to learn new skills (flow cytometry, in vivo calcium imaging, sequencing) and develop novel techniques. I will
also be given the opportunity to enhance skillsets required to achieve my career goals i.e. experimental design,
scientific communication, critical thinking etc. Completion of the proposed project will increase our
understanding of the interplay of mechanical information and immune cell dynamics in pain development and
open the doors to routes of selective therapeutic intervention."

Tumor Initiating Cells (TICs) are a subpopulation of tumor cells defined by their ability to self-renew and
regenerate the heterogeneous tumor. TICs have altered metabolic and drug efflux properties, allowing them to
persist as a sanctuary population of resistant cells during treatment. As such, TICs mediate tumor recurrence
and metastasis, which are key contributors to mortality. To date, however, there are no therapies targeting the
TIC population in solid tumors. My data show that the formation and maintenance of TICs in Ras-driven
colorectal and lung tumor cell lines are critically dependent on the molecular scaffold Kinase Suppressor of
Ras 1 (KSR1). KSR1 coordinates signaling through the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade downstream of oncogenic Ras.
KSR1 is necessary for Ras-driven tumor formation, but dispensable for normal cell growth. Moreover, ksr1-/-
mice are phenotypically normal but resistant to cancer formation. These characteristics highlight the value of
KSR1 as a potential therapeutic target. Our data further show that KSR1 KO can prevent MEK inhibitor
trametinib-mediated expansion of the TIC population and restore sensitivity to trametinib in both NSCLC and in
CRC where resistance currently limits clinical utility of this drug. Further characterization using KSR1
transgenes with defined mutations in downstream effector-binding regions has identified KSR1 interaction with
both ERK and AMPK to be implicated in maintenance of the TIC population, in vitro clonogenicity, and
resistance to trametinib. These data suggest the hypothesis that KSR1-dependent ERK and AMPK activation
in Ras-driven cancers plays a selective role in the formation of tumor-initiating cells and the drug resistance
conveyed by this subpopulation. I will test this hypothesis by 1) defining the proximal KSR1-dependent
signaling pathways that control TICs and trametinib resistance; and 2) assessing the ability of targeted KSR1
degradation to impair tumor-initiating capacity in a preclinical tumor organoid model. Completion of these aims
will expand mechanistic understanding of Ras-driven TIC formation and maintenance and may reveal a novel
therapeutic approach to treat TIC-mediated resistance, recurrence, and metastasis."

The effective management of substance use disorders (SUDs) requires interventions that minimize relapse risk.
Stress is a troublesome contributor to relapse, as it is pervasive and unavoidable in the lives of those with SUDs.
However, the contribution of stress to relapse is complex. While in extreme cases stressors serve as direct
triggers for relapse, more commonly they interact with other stimuli to set the stage for drug seeking. This
proposal examines the mechanisms and pathways that mediate the stage-setting effects of stress in SUDs and
investigates the use-dependent neuroadaptations that emerge with cocaine use that establish stressful stimuli
as “triggers”, rather than a “stage setters”, for relapse – a key transition point in the progression to addiction. We
have established a rat model for investigating the stage-setting effects of stress on cocaine seeking. Following
self-administration under conditions of limited daily access (14 x 2 hrs/day), stress does not reinstate
extinguished cocaine seeking but rather potentiates reinstatement to an otherwise subthreshold cocaine priming
dose, an effect that is observed in males and females and requires elevated corticosterone and endocannabinoid
signaling via the CB1 receptor in the prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PL-PFC). We hypothesize that stressor-induced
increases in brain corticosterone levels promote Gq G-protein signaling in PL-PFC pyramidal neurons via a rapid,
glucocorticoid receptor-independent, membrane-associated mechanism, thus mobilizing the endocannabinoid,
2-arachodonoylgycerol, and producing CB1R-dependent attenuation of GABA release from PL-PFC
interneurons. Further, we hypothesize that the loss of inhibitory control of PL-PFC projection pathways that
contribute to drug seeking primes them for activation by excitatory inputs, thus potentiating cocaine seeking.
This proposal further characterizes this mechanism (Aim 1) and seeks to identify the PL-PFC output pathways
that mediate stress-potentiated drug seeking (Aim 2). The contribution of stress to cocaine seeking changes with
the pattern of cocaine use. In contrast to what is observed following limited drug access, more prolonged daily
cocaine self-administration (14 x 6 hrs/day) establishes stressors as direct triggers for reinstatement. This
transition involves the recruitment of CRF regulation of ventral tegmental area neurons that project to the PL-
PFC, in part through increased VTA CRF-R1 expression. We hypothesize that adaptations in stress-related
signaling pathways in PL-projecting VTA neurons establish stressor control over drug seeking, representing a
key step in the progression of SUDs. This hypothesis is tested in Aim 3. The proposed work has great potential
to guide novel pharmacotherapeutic approaches and understanding how the influence of stress on cocaine use
varies among subpopulations of users and with addiction severity has important clinical implications. Finally, we
identify a novel mechanism through which stress can alter PFC function – a finding that has significance for
understanding the influence of stress on a range of healthy/adaptive and pathological/maladaptive behaviors."
10899499,"Project Summary/ Abstract:
Primordial Germ Cells (PGCs) are embryonic precursors to the adult germline, the proper development of which
is tantamount to organismal fitness. During embryonic development PGCs undergo two fate-restriction steps: 1)
specification, in which PGCs express pluripotent genes, a state called latent pluripotency, while undergoing
myriad epigenetic remodeling and 2) determination, in which the pluripotency program is extinguished and PGCs
differentiate according to the sex of the embryo. While molecular studies have carefully dissected PGC
specification, PGC determination remains poorly understood. Although the current state-of-the-art allows in vitro
induction of PGC-Like-Cells (PGCLCs) from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), these PGCLCs represent specified
PGCs and, thus far, cannot be reliably induced to undergo determination in vitro. This constitutes a significant
roadblock for in vitro gametogenesis, which offers a possibility for clinical relief of infertility in couples where
either partner is unable to produce their own gametes. We hypothesize that specific epigenetic changes drive
PGC determination and license gametogenic capacity. Of particular interest during this process is the regulation
of Transposable Elements (TEs), some of which remain capable of transposition and therefore threaten the
integrity of the germline genome. Conversely, some TEs of the Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) subclass harbor
transcription- and pluripotency- factor binding sites and could function during the time of determination to regulate
expression of the pluripotency network. To understand how regulation of LTR elements contributes to PGC
determination we employ an in vitro mouse model. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that PGC
determination is an epigenetic transition that is reliant on TRIM28, a highly conserved epigenetic scaffolding
protein, for two independent processes: regulation of LTR-class transposable elements and proper nucleolar
function. To test this, we will employ a PGC-specific conditional knockout model of TRIM28, allowing us to
interrogate determination in vivo. In Aim 1, I will use ATAC-seq and CutnTag sequencing to understand how loss
of TRIM28 alters genome accessibility and enhancer dynamics, hypothesizing that misregulation of LTR
elements in the absence of TRIM28 drives a failure to correctly regulate the switch in gene expression networks
as PGCs enter determination. In Aim 2, I use OligoPaint, a DNA-FISH approach, to assess how TRIM28 loss
effects nucleolar heterochromatin and morphology, and use chemical perturbation ex vivo to observe possible
phenocopy with loss of TRIM28. Completion of this work will have broad implications in our understanding of
how the PGC epigenome is rewired during determination to license gametogenesis. Insights from this work can
be leveraged to advance in vitro PGC models towards functional gametogenesis."

Transport of bile acids from blood through the liver into the bile is a fundamental part of the enterohepatic
cycle. Efficient transhepatic transport prevents cytotoxic effects of bile acids, and is critical for human health.
We have unexpectedly found that insulin, a hormone long known as a chief orchestrator of postprandial
metabolism, promotes hepatic bile acid transport. We have now shown that this occurs in humans, mice, and
sandwich cultured murine hepatocytes, a polarized in vitro model of hepatic transport. Moreover, we find that
obese, insulin resistant humans and mice have impaired hepatic bile acid transport, and this can be reversed
by weight loss. In this grant, we propose to determine the underlying biology of this pathway: Through which
upstream signaling mechanisms does insulin regulate bile acid transport? Which distal mediators of bile acid
transport are ultimately employed to carry out insulin’s effects? Which aspects of this pathway are disrupted in
obesity/insulin resistance? Does this pathway affect all bile acids? Is the effect specific to bile acids, or does it
broadly affect canalicular secretion? We will use gold-standard bile acid kinetics studies, hyperinsulinemic-
euglycemic clamps, state-of-the-art mass spectrometry, unique sandwich cultured hepatocyte models, and
tissue-specific knockout mice. Success of this work is expected to elucidate a fundamental effect of insulin on
hepatic function and postprandial nutrient handling."

Very long-chain acyl-coA dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCADD) continues to cause unyielding cardiomyopathy
with consequent heart failure and childhood death. A significant unmet need exists to elucidate cardiac-specific
insults that drive disease progression in order to develop novel therapeutic strategies capable of preventing
premature death. Although energy deficiency resulting from the diminished production of ATP from lipid fuels
has been implicated as a driver of VLCADD-associated pathologies, it is unlikely to explain the full spectrum of
tissue defects. Preliminary data presented herein suggest that lipotoxicity—mediated in large part by the
accumulation of ceramides—is a major contributor to VLCADD-induced heart failure and elucidates potential
therapeutic targets to treat this disease. The work proposed in this fellowship application will critically evaluate
the role of a class of lipotoxic lipid species, termed ceramides, as drivers of VLCADD-induced heart failure.
Mounting evidence reveals that elevated ceramides contribute to cardiomyopathy and heart failure in humans
and rodents and that cardiac function improves with ceramide depletion. Indeed, previous studies demonstrate
that ceramides are elevated in cardiac tissue from VLCADD mouse models. Still, it remains unknown whether
ceramide accumulation plays a causal role in developing heart failure in patients with VLCADD. Our preliminary
data confirm that ceramides are elevated in both in vitro and in vivo models of VLCADD, that in vitro inhibition of
ceramide synthesis improves many lipotoxic and metabolic deficits of VLCADD, and that in vivo inhibition of
ceramide synthesis improves cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac function in VLCADD mouse models. The
proposed project will determine if ceramides are mediators of VLCADD-induced heart failure and effective
biomarkers for cardiac disease risk in VLCADD patients. In Aim One, we will use in vivo methods of ceramide
reduction or induction to evaluate features of heart failure in VLCADD models. Studies proposed in Aim Two will
determine whether plasma ceramides are an effective biomarker for cardiac disease risk in VLCADD patients
using plasma from de-identified VLCADD patients (IRB_00007551) collected with informed consent by Dr. Nicola
Longo’s clinical team at the University of Utah and by our collaborator, Dr. Jerry Vockley, at the University of
Pittsburgh. This will be the first project investigating ceramides in VLCADD and the role they play in heart failure
observed in this patient population. Our findings will lay the groundwork for the application of novel
pharmaceutical strategies targeting ceramides as key drivers of heart failure in VLCADD. Furthermore,
completion of the proposed studies will greatly enrich the applicant’s pre-doctoral training, mastery of technical
skills, and development as a young scientist pursuing an independent research career."

 Alcohol-involved sexual violence (SV) is a major public health issue among young women. Research
consistently shows that SV in which the victim had been drinking at the time of the assault can have an
especially detrimental impact on survivors’ mental and physical health. Moreover, survivors who were drinking
are more likely than those were not drinking to receive negative reactions—such as blame, disbelief, or
minimization—in response to disclosure of their SV experiences to informal support providers (e.g., friends,
family, significant others). These negative reactions are consistently linked to more negative psychosocial
outcomes for survivors. Despite the clear importance of reactions to disclosure, one glaring gap in the literature
linking negative disclosure responses to adverse psychosocial outcomes among survivors is a lack of
knowledge about the content of disclosures made by survivors. That is, studies to date have simply asked
survivors about the social reactions they received to disclosures, without assessing the language they use
when disclosing their victimization. The present study seeks to fill this gap. The content of survivors’
disclosures—particularly their disclosure of alcohol use and the extent to which they express self-blame and
label their experience as assaultive—may be important mechanisms through which alcohol impairment at the
time of abuse impacts negative social reactions from supports. Three Aims will be pursued to test these
suppositions. First, replicating past work, we expect that women who report greater impairment from alcohol
use will receive greater negative reactions from informal supports. Second, we predict that the relationship
between greater impairment and greater negative reactions will be indirect by way of a) more detail about
impairment, b) greater self-blame, and c) less label use within the disclosure. Finally, to characterize the
content of disclosure and desired outcomes for women survivors of alcohol-involved SV, in-depth qualitative
interviews will be conducted with a purposeful subsample of survivors and their informal disclosure recipients.
Testing hypotheses for Aims 1 and 2 will be accomplished with online survey data collected from a national
sample of 550 women aged 18-25 who report an adult SV in which they consumed alcohol prior to the event
and first disclosed the experience to an informal support provider. Aim 3 will be accomplished though in-depth
qualitative interviews conducted separately with a purposeful subsample of survey participants (n = 30) and
their informal support providers (n = 30). This mixed methods approach has the potential to increase the
breadth and depth of our understanding of the disclosure process while better informing interventions to
educate disclosure recipients to react in a supportive fashion (i.e., by decreasing negative reactions)."

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent arrhythmia. Enhanced activation of ‘NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-
containing protein 3’ (NLRP3) inflammasome plays a causal role in promoting proarrhythmic events associated
with AF development. Activation of NLRP3 inflammasome produces two major effectors: interleukin (IL)-1b and
cleaved (active) N-terminal gasdermin-D (GSDMDNT). The precise functions of IL-1b and GSDMDNT in
cardiomyocytes and atrial arrhythmogenesis are largely unknown. Our preliminary data revealed that
cardiomyocyte-specific knockdown of IL-1b receptor type-1 (IL-1R1) attenuates susceptibility to AF of mice with
cardiomyocyte NLRP3 gain-of-function. Meanwhile, atrial specific overexpression of GSDMDNT in mice
(aGSDMDNT) also creates an arrhythmic substrate for AF development. Because the main function of GSDMDNT
is to form plasma membrane pores allowing the cell release of IL-1b and IL-1b protein is upregulated in
aGSDMDNT mice, we hypothesized that this GSDMDNT/IL-1b nexus creates a substrate for AF by promoting a
feedforward loop of NLRP3-inflammasome activation. Using mouse and human atrial systems we propose to 1)
elucidate the role of IL-1b signaling in cardiomyocytes and atrial arrhythmogenesis, 2) establish the causative
role and the functions of cardiomyocyte GSDMDNT in atrial arrhythmogenesis, and 3) establish and validate
GSDMDNT/IL-1b nexus as the driver of a feedforward loop of NLRP3-inflammasome activation in atrial
arrhythmogenesis. The outcome of these studies will provide a proof-of-concept for atrial specific targeting of IL-
1b signaling in AF patients and uncover novel and unique functions of IL-1b and GSDMDNT in atrial
cardiomyocytes and their specific contributions to AF development."

10749880,"Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most histologically diverse lung cancer subtype and frequently
metastasizes to the central nervous system (CNS). Our goal is to identify the molecular determinants of LUAD
lineage and histological heterogeneity and their biological consequences for metastasis. We previously identified
a novel lineage selective transcriptional program that constrains LUAD cell invasion, and showed that this
pathway is suppressed in high grade LUADs. Here, we provide evidence that invasive LUAD cells can activate
a neuroendocrine-like gene signature, which is further induced once tumor cells disseminate into the brain. This
phenomenon is linked to pervasive chromatin alterations in KRAS mutant cells that are competent for metastasis.
Moreover, activation of neuroendocrine-like genes in human tumors correlates with distinct morphological
subgroups of LUAD at risk for CNS relapse. We hypothesize that: 1) LUAD lineage reprogramming is driven by
chromatin modifying proteins, 2) histological heterogeneity is a measure of the adaptive capacity of high grade
LUADs, and 3) the activation of the neuroendocrine lineage in particular correlates with their predisposition for
CNS relapse. Many neuroendocrine genes encode for secreted proteins with dual glandular and neuroactive
functions. Hence, we also propose that 4) a subset of neuroendocrine-like genes enables disseminated LUAD
cells to establish a neurogenic niche that is required for brain metastatic outgrowth.
 Our mechanistic predictions will be studied by integrating epigenomics, functional genomics, and
experimental biology. These methods are applied to existing models of LUAD, as well as new models, which are
engineered in mice or derived from biopsies of patients consented through our unique Yale Lung Cancer Patient
Biopsy protocol. In Aim 1, we performed a functional genomic screen to nominate the histone methyltransferase
ASH1L as a novel epigenetic driver of lineage plasticity and metastatic competence. We will ascertain the stage
specific requirement for ASH1L during LUAD progression and metastasis, and identify the mechanism by which
it regulates the transcriptome of metastatic cells. In Aim 2, we identified the dual neuroendocrine/neuroactive
factor FGF9 as being epigenetically activated in LUAD cells and required for brain metastasis. We will genetically
test the prediction that tumor cell derived FGF9 stimulates oligodendrocyte progenitor cells to support metastatic
outgrowth via paracrine Sonic Hedgehog signaling. Finally, under both Aims 1 and 2, we will utilize human
biospecimens to study the relationship between epigenomic alterations, neuroendocrine marker expression,
histological heterogeneity, and clinical outcome in LUAD.
 Thoracic malignancies account for most cancer-related deaths. Our complementary Aims provide a cogent
mechanistic framework to understand the biological link between pulmonary specification, neurogenic functions,
and CNS relapse. Finally, our proposal will generate significant insight as to how prospective epigenetic
therapies can be harnessed for adjuvant therapy and/or the treatment of late stage brain metastasis."

As the dome-shaped, transparent outermost part of the eye, the cornea provides the majority of the focusing
power for the visual pathway. When it is damaged due to severe injury or disease, scarring often ensues,
resulting in reduced vision and, in many cases, blindness. In spite of the various types of corneal transplants
that are available, there remains a major clinical need for new modalities to restore transparency to scarred
corneas without donor tissue, which is in short supply worldwide. Corneal mesenchymal stromal cells (c-
MSCs) have known therapeutic effects on corneal scarring and wound healing, but the optimal way to
deliver their benefits to the eye have yet to be determined. We are developing Sutureless, Pro-regenerative,
Anterior Additive Collagen gel KeratopLasty (SPAACKL), a procedure that removes and replaces blinding
corneal scars with a transparent, stroma-like gel matrix containing c-MSCs. After removal of corneal scar
tissue, the material is applied to the defect as a viscous liquid suspension of c-MSCs, forming a crosslinked,
transparent cellularized stromal substitute within minutes that not only recreates the smooth surface
necessary for clear vision but also promotes rapid re-epithelialization. This technology leverages a
crosslinking technology known as copper-free click chemistry that is bio-orthogonal: it does not react with
proteins, cells, or biologic systems of any kind. As such, it can be safely applied to a corneal wound and
around c-MSCs without producing toxic side products, and without the need for light energy, catalysts or
accelerators. Our central hypothesis is that bio-orthogonal crosslinking can improve the regenerative
benefits of c-MSCs by preserving the bioactivity of its encapsulated cargo compared to less specific
crosslinking chemistries that are used currently in corneal surgery. In preliminary work, we have
demonstrated that bio-orthogonally crosslinked gels support the growth of encapsulated stromal cells and
have demonstrated the regenerative capacity of these cell-matrix composites to support rapid, multi-layered
epithelialization both ex vivo and in vivo. Motivated by this data, our first aim is to test the hypothesis that
matrix stiffness, composition, and crosslinking chemistry influence c-MSCs’ viability and secretion of pro-
regenerative factors. Our second aim is to test the hypothesis that encapsulated c-MSCs exert their pro-
regenerative influence on the corneal epithelium primarily through paracrine signaling. Our third aim is to
evaluate the ability of bio-orthogonally crosslinked hydrogels to deliver therapeutic cargo that enhances
epithelial and stromal regeneration through an in vivo keratectomy model. This research will build the
foundational data for eventual clinical translation of a new way to treat corneal blindness without the need
for sutures, light energy, or cadaveric donor tissue, and has the potential to one day help patients avoid the
need for a traditional corneal transplant."

Mutations in the Clarin1 (CLRN1) gene cause Usher syndrome type 3 (USH3), a devastating orphan disease
leading to combined blindness and deafness in humans. Despite its very low levels of expression, the lack of
CLRN1 results in progressive degeneration of rod and cone photoreceptors and cochlear hair cells. There is no
treatment currently available to prevent vision loss. The lack of animal models that display a retinal phenotype
has been a major barrier to understanding the USH3 retinal pathophysiology and developing therapies to prevent
the progressive degeneration of the photoreceptor cells. In recent studies, we and others reported the surprising
discovery that CLRN1 mRNA is enriched in retinal Müller glia across several vertebrate species. Our combined
published results challenge a long-standing photoreceptor-driven degenerative mechanism in USH3 and
suggest that pathology arises from disruption of key Müller glia-photoreceptor interactions. The significance of
CLRN1 expression in Müller glia and the sequence of pathological events culminating in widespread
photoreceptor cell loss are unknown. To address these gaps in our knowledge, and test the hypothesis that
USH3 is a Müller glia-driven disease affecting photoreceptors, this project proposes a cross-phylogenetic
integration approach with newly developed animal models of USH3, zebrafish and pig. In our preliminary data,
we show that our zebrafish model lacking clarin1 displays an age-dependent loss of photoreceptors. We will
selectively restore or delete CLRN1 expression specifically in Müller glia and determine whether CLRN1
presence/absence alters photoreceptor function, structure, and survival (Aim1). To identify the molecular and
cellular basis of USH3 retinal disease in a large animal model, we generated USH3 pigs with heterozygous,
biallelic CLRN1 mutations containing distinct insertions/deletions (indels) in exon 1. Many biallelic heterozygous
combinations of USH3 mutant pigs have profound hearing loss. A smaller subset shows alterations in the outer
retinal laminae detectable by optical coherence tomography and changes in the scotopic electroretinogram.
Therefore, we will compare the development of retinal disease across four independent lines of homozygous
biallelic USH3 mutant pigs (same indel) to identify the phenotype-driving mutation and specific cellular and
molecular changes in Müller glia and photoreceptors (Aim 2). Successful completion of this project will
significantly advance the field by providing new animal models and fundamental knowledge on USH3 disease,
to ultimately accelerate the development and validation of treatments to prevent blindness."

Microbiota imbalance impacts the development and therapeutic outcome of cancer by altering host immune
response and inflammation. Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) is the most common cancer in HIV-infected patients caused
by infection of Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Despite antiretroviral therapy, KS remains
common among HIV-infected patients. It remains unclear what factors might influence the development and
therapeutic outcome of AIDS-KS? In response to RFA-CA-22-056 entitled: “Basic/Translational Research on
Health Disparities in Underrepresented People Living with HIV (PLWH) and Cancer”, this application specifically
addresses the underserved African populations that have high numbers of new HIV infections with the long-
term goal is to delineate the pathogenesis of AIDS-associated KS (AIDS-KS), and identify effective therapeutic
targets and agents as well as prognostic biomarkers. We have recently shown the impoverishment of oral
microbial diversity and enrichment of specific microbiota in oral AIDS-KS, and demonstrated that bacteria and
their products lipopolysaccharide and flagellin promote KSHV-induced tumorigenesis by enhancing inflammation
in a preclinical KSHV-induced KS animal model. Our hypothesis is that specific microbiota regulates
inflammation to impact KS development and therapeutic outcome in AIDS-KS patients. We have
assembled a strong collaborative team with diverse expertise in HIV infection, KSHV biology, microbiome, clinical
sciences, epidemiology, statistics, computational biology and machine learning. We will take advantage of the
long-term clinical studies in Africa with well-defined cross-sectional, case-control and longitudinal cohorts of large
HIV-infected and AIDS-KS populations directed by investigators of this project. We will determine the impact of
specific microbiota on inflammation and AIDS-KS development by performing case-control analyses in naïve
AIDS-KS and HIV/KSHV patients without KS (Aim 1); and examine the impact of specific microbiota on the
therapeutic outcome of KS by case-control longitudinal analyses of AIDS-KS patients undergoing anti-retroviral
therapy followed by validation analyses in an independent cohort (Aim 2). This interdisciplinary project will
analyze the molecular, virological, microbial, immunological, single cell spatial omics, and clinical features of
AIDS-KS patients using advanced machine learning approaches. We expect to identify factors that influence the
development and therapeutic outcome of AIDS-KS patients. The proposed work is highly significant, and will
have prognostic, preventive and therapeutic impacts on AIDS-KS patients. This will be the first time that the role
of microbiota will be systematically examined in AIDS-KS patients from well-characterized cohorts. The proposed
innovative approaches such as spatial single cell sequencing and machine learning will generate unique and
unprecedented results, providing novel insights into the pathogenesis and therapeutic outcome of AIDS-KS."

Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) involves the gain of somatic mutations that confer a
selective advantage to hematopoietic stem cells and lead to the expansion of a clonal population of blood cells.
CHIP is common in older individuals and is associated with increased risk of blood cancers and atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Genes commonly mutated in CHIP include known regulators of DNA
methylation (DNAm) and RNA splicing. In this application, we propose to take advantage of a novel omics data
resource being generated by the TOPMed program to investigate the roles of DNAm, gene expression, and
differential splicing as mechanisms potentially mediating the relationship between CHIP and risk for ASCVD. In
Aim 1 we will use genome-wide DNAm and RNA-seq data collected from blood samples of tens of thousands of
individuals to investigate whether methylomic and transcriptomic patterns differ in individuals with CHIP. We will
consider individual genes and subsets of the genes most commonly mutated in CHIP separately, since each of
these genes is likely to have different functional consequences given their different regulatory roles. In Aim 2,
we will test for the presence of CHIP-associated methylomic and transcriptomic differences that are driven by
specific immune cell types. In Aim 3, we will use Mendelian randomization to identify CpG sites or genes that
may causally mediate the relationship between CHIP mutations and ASCVD risk. In Aim 4, we will integrate the
multiple omics data in a biologically informed deep learning model to investigate how CHIP mutations and
methylomic and transcriptomic changes may collectively contribute to risk for ASCVD and identify key biological
processes through which these changes influence disease risk. By characterizing the epigenomic and
transcriptomic consequences of CHIP mutations in specific genes and within specific cell types and examining
the potential of TOPMed trans-omic data to predict disease risk, this work will advance current understanding of
CHIP and risk for ASCVD."
10870116,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Given the substantial adverse health and economic consequences of diabetes,
preventing progression of prediabetes (prevalence of 38% in U.S. adults) to type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major
public health goal. The environment plays a critical role in determining risk for T2D. Urbanization has been
associated with increased psychosocial stress and adverse health outcomes. Stress responses cause hormonal
changes that lead to insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, inflammation, oxidative stress, and obesity. Increased
exposure to air pollution has been associated with higher risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
‘Greenspace’ is defined as publicly accessible areas with predominant naturalistic elements (e.g., trees, grass,
water features, etc.). Previous studies in adults support the hypothesis that exposure to Greenspace (‘Green’)
may have several health benefits relative to urban built (‘Gray’) environments. These benefits may include better
autonomic functioning as assessed by improved heart rate variability (HRV), reductions in anxiety/stress, and
enhanced psychological restoration, with Greenspace also serving to buffer air pollution. Walking is the most
common form of moderate-intensity physical activity and has a beneficial influence on blood glucose control.
Preliminary studies have suggested walking and exposure to Greenspace may act together to improve health
outcomes. Yet, aside from our preliminary studies, rigorous experimental studies have not been conducted to
examine how regular walking may interact with exposure to urban Greenspace, compared to urban Grayspace,
to improve health. These studies are needed to investigate novel and highly generalizable strategies for “Green
exercise”, capable of being implemented at the population-level to reduce the burden of disease. Therefore, we
will conduct a mechanistic randomized crossover trial to compare differences in physiological, psychological, air
pollution, and cardiometabolic risk measures between walking interventions completed in urban Green and Gray
environments in adults with prediabetes. This multisite trial will include 180 individuals within metropolitan areas
of Minneapolis/St. Paul, MN and Chicago, IL. Walking interventions will be completed in urban Green and urban
Gray environments, with participants engaging in 150 minutes/week of walking for 6 weeks in each environment,
separated by a 5-week washout. Specific Aims: Aim 1: Measure and compare psychosocial stress between
Green and Gray walking. Aim 2: Measure and compare physiological stress over six weeks between Green and
Gray walking. Aim 3: Measure real-time individual exposure to ambient particulate matter using personal air
pollution monitors with GPS tracking while walking in Green and Gray environments. Aim 4: Measure individual
cardiometabolic disease risk scores (index of blood glucose, insulin, lipids, systolic blood pressure, and waist)
and inflammatory factors before and after 6 weeks of Green and Gray walking. Aim 5 (exploratory): Examine
whether physiological, psychological, and air pollution measures mediate the differential impact of Green vs.
Gray walking on cardiometabolic risk and inflammation using regression-based mediation models."

Chronic kidney disease is a leading cause of death in the United States and places an immense burden on the
healthcare system. Many cases of chronic kidney disease eventually result in renal fibrosis, which is
characterized by deposition of excess extracellular matrix (ECM) by myofibroblasts and contributes to eventual
organ failure. Recent studies have identified renal pericytes, a type of perivascular cell that surrounds
endothelial cells of small vessels such as capillaries, as the source of myofibroblasts in fibrosis. Despite this
characterized role in a major disease process, little is known about the developmental origin or role of
pericytes.
We have characterized a novel population of pericytes that surrounds arteries only during development, which
we call periarterial pericytes. We have characterized the origin of these pericytes using murine genetic
reporters. Furthermore, we have identified a potential regulator of pericyte migration, which is present in the
kidney during development. This temporary guidance of periarterial pericytes implies an important role in
arteriogenesis. Our preliminary data suggest that pericytes may be required for collagen production and
vascular smooth muscle differentiation during nephrogenesis, mirroring their pathogenic role in fibrosis. Thus,
the overall goal of this project is to define the role of periarterial pericytes during nephrogenesis in remodeling
the ECM of the periarterial niche to support vascular smooth muscle maturation, as well as to elucidate the
mechanism by their localization is regulated during development. We will utilize murine genetic lineage tracing
tools, in addition to immunofluorescence staining and cutting edge in situ hybridization techniques, to trace the
origin, fate, and gene expression of periarterial pericytes throughout development. We will selectively ablate
pericytes in vivo to assess their requirement in arteriogenesis and smooth muscle coverage. Finally, we will
utilize in vitro models to clarify intracellular interactions that are required for pericyte secretion of ECM and
smooth muscle cell maturation, as well as to elucidate the mechanism by which pericyte migration is regulated.
Collectively, these studies will characterize a novel role of pericytes during development, as well as elucidate
molecular mechanisms that may be dysregulated in disease processes such as renal fibrosis. This information
may inform future therapies for chronic kidney disease or regenerative medicine efforts, both which will be
badly needed as the prevalence of kidney disease grows in the United States and abroad."
10892271,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
During the past 20 years, Congress, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) have made it clear that safe drug therapy for children is a high priority. With the rapidly
changing health care and research environments, it has become essential to focus on the training of the next
generation of leaders in Pediatric Clinical Pharmacology who are involved in the design and conduct of hands-
on drug studies in children to augment the translation of new and effective therapies for children. The proposed
Cincinnati Children’s Pediatric Clinical Pharmacology K12 program aims to provide the resources for a diverse
group of junior faculty to become the next leaders in Pediatric Clinical Pharmacology. This includes training in
the principles of Pediatric Clinical Pharmacology to those who may never had previous clinical pharmacology
experience while also facilitating the transition from fellowship to junior faculty to independent investigator for
those who have had previous fellowship training in Pediatric Clinical Pharmacology. The training program we
propose in this application for K12 Scholars will leverage the outstanding research infrastructure that exists within
Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center and the University of Cincinnati Academic Health Center, the
strong research training activities that we have built within the Cincinnati Children’s Division of Clinical
Pharmacology, and the robust collaborations that our Division has developed with other Clinical Pharmacology
T32 sites and Clinical Pharmacology programs throughout the nation. Through our rigorous training program,
we expect Scholars to achieve the following five core competencies: 1) Foundational Knowledge and Skill in
Pharmacometrics, 2) Foundational Knowledge and Skills in Pharmacogenetics, 3) In-depth Understanding of the
Impact of Developmental Pharmacology Principles on Drug Action and Toxicity, 4) Ability to Conduct Studies in
a Variety of Pediatric Patient Populations, and 5) Collaborative Skills in Interdisciplinary Team Research. The
four pillars of training to achieve these core competencies will be focused on 1) research training, 2) responsible
conduct of research, 3) teaching/research mentorship and 4) leadership and career development through both
experiential learning and didactic courses with knowledge and skills to be attained and expected outcomes in
each of these areas. Intended Scholar outcomes include high impact manuscripts describing research in
Pediatric Clinical Pharmacology, submission of independent K career development awards or R awards, delivery
of lectures and presentations on clinical pharmacology topics in local forums and national conferences,
experience in mentoring trainees locally and nationally, and leadership positions in national committees in
Clinical Pharmacology societies. We intend to have two junior faculty Scholars appointed at any time with the
anticipated appointments being 2 to 3 years, depending on external grant funding. This program will expand the
critically small pool of Pediatric Clinical Pharmacology investigators who will advance personalized therapeutics
in pediatrics to improve the health outcomes of children."
10873105,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Affiliative caregiving behaviors are essential for the survival and well-being of a social species. Specifically,
prosocial comforting behavior can improve the physical and mental health of distressed individuals. Similarly,
parental care is critical for offspring survival and also benefits the welfare of offspring. However, despite the
importance of both empathetic prosocial behaviors and parental caregiving for developing and maintaining
social bonds, their underlying neural circuitry remain incompletely characterized. While prosocial care is
primarily directed towards adult animals, a long-standing proposal for the origin of prosocial care points to
potential evolutionary roots in parental care: the need to support helpless offspring drove the development of
neural, chemical, and psychological sensitivity to detect contextual cues of others’ needs. The proposed
research will explore the shared neural circuits underlying these behaviors, providing insight into the
fundamental principles subserving social affiliation. While much is known about the positive control of
parenting, the neural circuitry of comforting prosocial behavior is not as well defined. The medial preoptic
area (MPOA) is a key region for regulating parenting behaviors. Recent evidence suggests the MPOA may
also be involved in modulating prosocial comforting behavior in rodents. Other lines of evidence implicate the
dopaminergic system in affiliative and parenting behavior through inhibitory inputs to the ventral tegmental
area (VTA). This proposal hypothesizes that the inhibitory MPOA-VTA circuit is functionally significant as
a shared node for prosocial and parental behaviors in mice. My central hypothesis will be tested in two
specific aims: (1) determine if inhibitory MPOA neurons projecting to the VTA control affiliative allogrooming
and parental behavior, and (2) characterize how these encode social sensory cues as well as
offspring-directed and conspecific-directed caregiving behavior. Collectively, these experiments will expand
our understanding of the neural circuits shaping both prosocial and parenting behaviors, which are critical to
the formation of fundamental social bonds. A more robust mechanistic understanding of the MPOA-VTA and
its functions in prosocial and parental circuits will offer insights into the long-postulated role of parental care in
mammals as the origin of social affiliation."
10890855,"The kynurenine pathway catabolizes over 95% of all tryptophan primarily through the actions of
tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase 2 (TDO2) in hepatocytes and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenese 1 (IDO1) in myeloid
leukocytes. Increased kynurenine synthesis in dendritic cells (DC) secondary to IDO1 upregulation is strongly
linked with the generation of a tolerogenic phenotype by promoting anti-inflammatory signaling, regulatory T cell
(Treg) polarization and immune tolerance, an attenuated inflammatory response instigated by immune cells that
are repeatedly exposed to TLR ligands. However, while the pathophysiologic relevance of this pathway is well-
established, the mechanism behind the immunomodulatory effects of kynurenine remain poorly defined. Using
semi-targeted metabolomic approaches, we recently published that systemic increases in kynurenine levels
secondary to either exogenous supplementation or chronic inflammation are associated with the formation of the
novel cysteine-reactive kynurenine-derived electrophile Kyn-CKA. Kyn-CKA promotes Nrf2-depedent signaling,
inhibits TLR4-dependent NF-κB pathways and attenuates inflammatory responses in endotoxin-challenged mice
in a redox-dependent manner. In addition, Kyn-CKA engages AhR signaling with 20-fold higher potency than its
kynurenine precursor, suggesting a potential pro-tolerogenic role in DC and T-cells. Specifically designed state-
of-the-art LC-MS/MS assays will enable the quantification of Kyn-CKA in the context of other kynurenine pathway
metabolites in activated and non-activated myeloid leukocytes, as well as the elucidation of rate-limiting cellular
uptake and export mechanisms. Primary macrophages, dendritic, and T cells derived from pathway-specific
knock-out animals will be harnessed in conjunction with novel bio-orthogonal labeling strategies and isotope-
tracing metabolic flux analyses to define the mechanistic basis of the anti-inflammatory actions of Kyn-CKA both
in terms of the modulation of specific signaling pathways and its effects on inflammation-elicited changes in
energy metabolism. The ability of Kyn-CKA to promote tolerogenic responses will be established by assessing
its effect on the maturation and activation of conventional DC subpopulations, its impact on T cell polarization,
and its ability to modulate endotoxin resistance and tolerance in vivo. Mice expressing or lacking critical
mediators of Kyn-CKA formation and action in cell-specific compartments will be used to obtain mechanistic
insights in vivo. In summary, the Research Plan addresses a hitherto unappreciated redox-dependent
component of the immunomodulatory actions of the kynurenine pathway, mediated by the formation of
electrophilic Kyn-CKA. If successful, our work will enable the potential development of novel Kyn-CKA based
pharmacological interventions for dysregulated immune responses such as chronic inflammation, autoimmune
diseases, cancer, and allograft rejection."
10929394,"Project Abstract
Postural instability and gait deficits are common causes of falls, decreased mobility, and increased
morbidity in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). These axial motor signs are often resistant to current
treatments, including dopamine replacement therapy (levodopa) and deep brain stimulation (DBS).
Currently, the mechanisms contributing to the impaired control of the lower limbs are poorly understood.
Extensor muscles of the lower limbs are critical for maintaining vertical support against gravity and
generating power during gait. In people with PD, impairment in extensor muscle strength is greater than
the flexors. Levodopa and subthalamic DBS (STN DBS) improve strength in both the flexors and extensors
but have less of an effect in the extensors. Similarly, levodopa and STN DBS do not significantly improve
plantar flexor torque generation during gait. Currently, the mechanisms contributing to greater defici ts in
extensor compared to flexor muscle function in PD are unknown, but likely reflect differences in
corticospinal, basal ganglia and brainstem contributions to the control of these muscles. This project aims
to understand how flexors (tibialis anterior) and extensors (gastrocnemius, soleus) of the ankle contribute
to leg rigidity and bradykinesia and gait in people with PD. Aim 1a will use transcranial magnetic
stimulation of the leg region of the motor cortex to examine the excitability of corticomotoneuronal and
intracortical pathways controlling the ankle flexors and extensors in PD, and controls. Aim 1b will examine
the relationships between intracortical and corticomotoneuronal responses and quantitative measures of
ankle bradykinesia and rigidity, and gait. Aim 2 will evaluate the response dynamics (60 minute wash-out,
60 minute wash-in) of globus pallidus DBS (GP DBS) on ankle rigidity, bradykinesia, and gait in PD to test
the hypothesis that the acute and steady-state effects of GP DBS are different between the ankle flexors
and extensors. Response dynamics across these behavioral measures will be examined in relation to the
activation of neural pathways in and around the globus pallidus (estimated via patient-specific
computational modeling of DBS) to determine which pathways are associated with which motor outcomes.
The results of this project will provide an increased understanding of how PD and targeted TMS and GP
DBS interventions impact the function of the ankle dorsi and plantar flexors. This knowledge will be
important for the development and testing of novel interventions to treat postural and gait disorders and
improve quality of life in people with PD."
10752698,"SUMMARY
 At the leading edge of a polarized macrophage, a membrane-based chemotaxis pathway directs cell mi-
gration up attractant gradients to sites of infection, inflammation, or tissue damage. Upon arrival, a phagocyto-
sis pathway controls the formation and internalization of a phagosome in which the pathogens or damaged tis-
sue are engulfed and destroyed. Both the chemotaxis and phagocytosis pathways are regulated by PI3K lipid
kinases that serve as regulatory hubs by integrating Ca2+, receptor, G protein, and other input signals while
phosphorylating substrate lipids to produce output lipid signals. The potent lipid signals, in turn, activate multi-
ple downstream protein kinases. In chemotaxis, the lipid signal controls actin and membrane remodeling to
drive the leading edge up the attractant gradient. In phagocytosis, the lipid signal controls processing of the
phagosome including the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to inactivate pathogens. Closely related
PI3K pathways regulate other cell processes, notably including cell growth. When dysregulated, PI3K path-
ways trigger or exacerbate a wide array of human diseases ranging from cancer and developmental disorders
to defects in innate immunity, inflammation or autoimmunity.
 The two classes of PI3K lipid kinases targeted by this research program are Class 1 PI3-Kinases (PI3K1)
that generate the signaling lipid PIP3 at the leading edge membrane of polarized macrophages, and Class 3
PI3-Kinases (PI3K3, specifically PI3K3 Complex II) that produce PI3P on the surface of the phagosome. The
proposed research seeks to understand the regulation of both pathways by addressing fundamental, broad
questions including: (i) How do PI3K1 and PI3K3 regulatory hubs integrate multiple inputs from Ca2+ channels,
receptors, G proteins and other effectors, and do these inputs combine in additive, synergistic, or opposing
fashions? (ii) How do the resulting PIP3 and PI3P output lipids activate downstream protein kinases, including
some of the most important master kinases in the cell? (iii) How do drugs, potential therapeutics, and disease-
linked mutations inhibit or superactivate key components and reaction steps to generate pathway perturbation
or dysregulation?
 To answer these and other questions, the PI's laboratory has developed a unique, two-pronged approach
combining innovative, in vitro single molecule methods with live cell imaging studies. The in vitro studies utilize
single molecule TIRF to elucidate signaling mechanisms in a subsection of the pathway, or signaling module,
that is reconstituted on a supported lipid bilayer under near physiological conditions. The live cell studies em-
ploy fluorescent sensors and cell imaging to test key predictions of the in vitro mechanistic model for relevance
in the cellular context. The PI has a strong track record and continues to play leadership roles in his research
field, as well as the university and scientific communities. Overall, this research program is well positioned to
continue generating fundamental advances with significant impacts on signaling biology and medicine."

Afro-Latinos make up 12% of the Latino population, rapidly increasing in the US, with approximately 6 million
Afro-Latinos adults in 2020. Notably, over two-thirds are of reproductive age, emphasizing the importance of
including this group when examining health outcomes related to maternal and child health. Most of the existing
literature on maternal and infant health disparities in the US has identified ethnicity and race as mutually
exclusive categories, e.g., non-Latino Black vs Latino.Afro-Latinas may be disadvantaged in health outcomes
due to the intersectionality of multiple minority identities. Little is known about the perinatal outcomes for women
who are both Black and Latina. It is well established in the literature that women of color, particularly non-Latina
Black women, experience detrimental social determinants of health, such as structural barriers, racism,
discrimination, and residential racial segregation. However, the burden of these barriers is not well understood
among Afro-Latinas who may be experiencing distinctive stressors of societal disadvantages based on race and
skin color. Guided by Intersectionality Theory, this proposal aims to determine if Afro-Latinas mothers and
their infants are at increased risk of maternal morbidities and adverse birth outcomes compared to
childbearing women of other racial/ethnic identities through two specific aims: 1) Determine differences in
maternal morbidity (pregnancy-related hypertension, pregnancy-related diabetes) and infant birth outcomes
(birth weight, preterm birth) among Afro-Latinas in Florida compared to White Latina, non-Latina Black, and non-
Latina White mothers and their infants. (2) Examine the effects of residential racial segregation, neighborhood
deprivation, and prenatal care utilization with maternal morbidity and infant birth outcomes among Afro-Latinas
in Florida compared to women of other racial/ethnic identities. This research will use data from the Florida Vital
Statistics (2004-2022) with Afro-Latina mothers and their infants (n=176,040) compared to childbearing women
of other racial/ethnic identities (n=3,805,588). The accompanying career training plan will provide a foundation
for me to (1) Expand my expertise in the social determinants of health and health equity for Afro- Latina mothers
and their children (2) Develop methodological, analytic, and data management skills in multi-level data research
methods (3) Expand career development and interdisciplinary team skills and accomplish professional
development goals. My interdisciplinary mentorship team will guide me throughout this award. The career
development and research plan will support my growth as an independent nurse scientist examining maternal-
child health disparities. This proposal provides an innovative perspective directly aligned with the NINR’s aim to
address social determinants of health barriers that place vulnerable populations, like Afro-Latinas, at avoidable
health disadvantages."

The Dynamic Experiences in Neuroscience to Diversify Research Internship Training Exposures for Students
(DENDRITES) Program aims to encourage and support the research and career development of
underrepresented minorities (URM) students interested in basic, clinical, and translational neuroscience. The
DENDRITES Program will accomplish this by executing three specific aims. The first aim is to expose
undergraduate students to an intensive nine-week mentored summer research experience by pairing students
with an experienced scientific mentor that will introduce students to robust and rigorous research experiences.
The goal is for URM undergraduate students to get hands-on research experience which will expose them to
cutting-edge neuroscience research and solidify the students’ commitment to research careers. The second
aim is to leverage the Leadership Alliance Summer Research – Early Identification Program (SR-EIP) at
UChicago to facilitate the transition to graduate programs. To accomplish this aim, we will collaborate with the
SR-EIP to offer professional development workshops which will improve DENDRITES participants’ skills and
qualifications to make them competitive candidates when applying for graduate school. In addition, we have
created unique activities for DENDRITES participants such as cluster groups meetings and a seminar series
led by graduate students. These activities will provide educational resources and experiences which visiting
URM students would otherwise not receive at their home institutions. Finally, by collaborating with the
University of Chicago SR-EIP program DENDRITES participants will be able to attend the Leadership Alliance
National Symposium which will allow students to present and disseminate their summer research. The third
aim is to recruit students historically underrepresented in academia to diversify the neuroscience workforce. By
familiarizing students with UChicago, its opportunities, and its faculty members, our program will facilitate
students’ later application and potential acceptance into highly-competitive graduate schools. Overall, the long-
term goal of the DENDRITES Program is to diversify the neuroscience workforce by creating a strong pipeline
of young neuroscience researchers who can make significant contributions to neuroscience discoveries."

Cognitive dysfunction in the context of mood disorders has been associated with poorer treatment response
and is a key risk factor for recurrence after remission. Thus, accurate, objective assessment of cognitive
function in patients with mood disorders is of paramount clinical utility. The proposed study will use a novel
smartphone technology (“BiAffect”) that uses typing dynamics and motor kinematics to unobtrusively, securely,
and passively monitor cognitive function in a transdiagnostic sample of participants with mood disorders
(unipolar depression, bipolar disorder type I/II, dysthymia). The core technology of BiAffect is a custom-built
smartphone virtual keyboard that replaces the native default keyboard, allowing the collection of real-time data
of real and potential clinical relevance while individuals interact with their device as usual within their natural
environment. BiAffect will be used in the sample to predict 1) altered brain network properties associated with
cognitive dysfunction in mood disorders and 2) prospective changes in clinical mood symptoms in a
transdiagnostic sample of participants with mood disorders."
10747915,"Brief Summary
 The number of mechanically ventilated children has grown 80-fold since the 1990s and ventilator-
associated infections (VAIs) are a leading complication. In the absence of a gold standard, there is clinical
uncertainty around the diagnosis of VAIs, and endotracheal aspirate cultures (EACs) are commonly obtained
as a tool to assess for VAI. Although EAC results are not specific for infection versus colonization, many
clinicians interpret bacterial growth in EACs as evidence of infection prompting treatment. Indeed, 50% of
antibiotics used in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) are for VAIs. Thus, over-use of EACs contributes to
unnecessary antibiotic treatment, compounding patient morbidity by promoting antibiotic resistance, antibiotic-
associated adverse events, and increased healthcare costs. Diagnostic stewardship programs promoting the
judicious use of EACs have significant potential to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use and improve the quality
of care for thousands of ventilated children. The goal of this study is to (1) define nationwide EAC practices
and identify optimal EAC practices in children with suspected VAIs, (2) assess key clinical outcomes after a
pilot program implementing interventions to improve EAC practices, and (3) identify facilitators and barriers of
EAC diagnostic stewardship programs to inform reproducible implementation strategies.
 Dr. Sick-Samuels is a faculty member in Pediatric Infectious Diseases at the Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine. She is committed to conducting patient-oriented research to develop, implement, measure
the impact of, and disseminate diagnostic stewardship programs to improve the care of complex hospitalized
patients. During this career-development award, she seeks to (1) develop expertise in implementation science
and patient safety and quality research, (2) analyze clinical outcomes used in patient safety and quality
research, (3) apply qualitative research methods to implementation science, and (4) prepare to conduct a
multicenter hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial. Her primary mentor, Dr. Aaron Milstone, has extensive
experience in clinical research and trials dedicated to prevention of antibiotic-resistance and healthcare-
associated infections in children. Her co-mentors, Dr. Sean Berenholtz, is a national and international leader in
patient safety and quality and prevention of ventilator-associated infections, and Dr. Jill Marsteller is a national
expert in implementation science researching determinants of successful implementation and dissemination of
evidence-based practices. Her advisors and collaborators have expertise in critical care medicine, infectious
diseases, patient safety and quality, implementation science, human factors engineering, and biostatistics. This
work will prepare her to develop an R01 proposal to conduct a multicenter effectiveness-implementation trial of
EAC diagnostic stewardship. With this mentored research, the resource rich environment of Johns Hopkins
University and the protected time to complete her training goals, Dr. Sick-Samuels will become an independent

10749001,"The goal of this project is to develop better ways to treat motor symptoms of Parkinson’s
disease. People with Parkinson’s disease typically have higher amounts of synchronization
across sensorimotor brain areas especially in the beta bands. This abnormal synchrony is
thought to impede the production of normal motor patterns. Breaking up that excess synchrony
can potentially improve motor symptoms and may help to renormalize brain network functioning.
To that end, somatosensory stimulation will be used in a rat model of Parkinson’s disease to try
to disrupt the excess brain network synchrony seen in Parkinson’s disease. Motor
improvements and brain network changes will be directly compared when stimulation is used to
activate two types of somatosensory receptors: 1) proprioceptive receptors (via electrically
induced twitches in limb muscles), and 2) cutaneous receptors (via subcutaneous stimulation to
activate the cutaneous receptors directly). Additionally, two types of stimulation patterns will also
be compared: 1) a consistent desynchronizing pattern, and 2) a randomly varying pattern. Motor
activity will be quantified before, during and after each combination of stimulation options. The
stimulation option that improves motor performance the most will then be further assessed to
determine whether it’s best to continuously apply that type of stimulation (open loop) or to only
turn it on when the brain is exhibiting excess synchrony (closed loop). The results of this study
will guide future human testing and could provide a less risky, non- or minimally invasive
treatment option with fewer side effects than current stimulation options like deep brain
stimulation."

Kabuki Syndrome (KS) is a rare disease caused by heterozygous pathogenic mutations in two known
genes: KDM6A (~20% cases) and KMT2D (~80% cases). Both genes are broadly expressed in many
tissues and their activity spans temporally from development to postnatal adult life. KS patients present
with various degrees of clinical abnormalities, including severe muscular hypotonia and reduced muscle
strength. Whether hypotonia develops as a consequence of nerve conduction malfunction or it is due to a
cell-autonomous primary defect in skeletal muscle is currently unknown. Further, skeletal muscle tissue
from patients affected by KS has not been thoroughly studied. Our main hypothesis is that skeletal muscle
tissue is primarily affected by mutations in KMT2D, which results in dysregulated muscle function. We
propose to validate our hypothesis via the following specific Aims: 1) Define primary versus secondary
muscle function defects using constitutive and conditional mouse models of KS; 2) Determine the gene
networks and molecular targets of KMT2D driving muscle hypotonia in constitutive and conditional KS
mouse models; 3) Define muscle satellite cell heterogeneity and `immaturity' in conditional and constitutive
KS models, as well as in human patients. The work proposed will fill major gaps in our lack of knowledge
about etiology of hypotonia in Kabuki syndrome and will pave the way for clinical improvements of patient
care."
10894644,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The visual cortex can process identical stimuli differently depending on context; behavioral states such as
locomotion or arousal can alter the magnitude and the specificity of visual responses. The neuromodulator
acetylcholine (ACh) is implicated in state-dependent processing and acts on diverse inhibitory interneurons in
cortical circuits, but it remains uncertain how interneuron classes contribute to state-dependence. Particular
controversy surrounds the role of the somatostatin-positive (SOM) cells, which shape circuit output by directly
inhibiting pyramidal cells. One model suggests that ACh action on upstream interneurons triggers suppression
of SOM cells via release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA). This disinhibits pyramidal
cells to increase gain in visual circuits during locomotion and potentially other states. However, contradictory
findings reveal that SOM cells, which can be directly facilitated by ACh through muscarinic receptors, are actually
more active during locomotion, indicating the disinhibitory model is not sufficient to explain context dependence.
 This proposal tests the hypothesis that muscarinic and GABAergic action on SOM cells have
complementary effects on modulating visual cortex circuits and shaping in visual discrimination. I hypothesize
that muscarinic action on SOM cells contributes to tuning of the pyramidal population, while GABAergic action
on SOM cells contributes to pyramidal cell gain. I will dissect this utilizing unprecedented intersectional control
of specific receptors on specific cell types via the Drugs Acutely Restricted by Tethering (DART) methodology
coupled with 2-photon calcium imaging of mouse primary visual cortex.
 In Aim 1, I will selectively antagonize muscarinic receptors on SOM cells and record activity of SOM cells
and nearby pyramidal cells as mice passively view visual stimuli. I will assess visual responses and how
responses are altered by locomotion and arousal, to reveal the direct impact of ACh on SOM cells in basal visual
processing and modulation by behavioral state. In Aim 2, I will selectively block GABA receptors on SOM cells,
again recording SOM and pyramidal cell activity during passive viewing. This will allow me to clarify how inhibition
onto SOM cells contributes to basal visual process and circuit modulation during locomotion and arousal. If, as
hypothesized, muscarinic and GABAergic control impact tuning and gain of pyramidal cells, this could
meaningfully impact visual discrimination. To assess how these two pathways act on animals' ability to perceive
and use visual information, in Aim 3 I will selectively antagonize muscarinic or GABAergic receptors on SOM
cells, and record activity of SOM and pyramidal cells, while mice perform an orientation change detection task.
Together these data will resolve longstanding questions around how neuromodulators imbue visual circuits with
context specificity."

Periodontal diseases are highly common infectious diseases. Chronic inflammation in periodontitis results in the
progressive destruction of hard and soft tissues and enhances susceptibility to other systemic disease. The host
factors that regulate the magnitude, nature and persistence of inflammatory responses in the oral are
incompletely understood. We have previously shown that reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by the
activation of leukocyte NADPH oxidase enzyme complex plays a critical role in dampening hyperinflammatory
responses. Oxidase deficiency in mice resulted in profound inflammation characterized by dysregulated
neutrophil and macrophages responses and resolution delays. These data support a somewhat counterintuitive
role for ROS in limiting host inflammation. Whether oxidants modulate inflammatory pathways in the oral cavity
is unclear. Our central hypothesis is that the NADPH oxidase derived-ROS, independent of their antimicrobial
functions, play key roles in redox modulation of neutrophil and macrophage effector functions in vitro and in vivo.
Further, we hypothesize that while excessive amounts of ROS are associated with the pathophysiology of
periodontal diseases, low-level, localized ROS responses are immuno-regulatory. These hypotheses will be
tested in two specific aims. 1) Determine the role of NADPH oxidase in the regulation of PMN effector functions
in acute responses in the gingiva. 2) Determine the role of NADPH oxidase in the modulation of macrophage
function and resolution of gingival inflammation. The use of conditional knockout mice that lack NADPH oxidase
activity selectively in neutrophils or macrophages will enable us to specifically determine the role of oxidants in
a cell intrinsic manner in vivo. The data generated by these studies will shed key mechanistic insights in our
understanding of immune pathways relevant in gingival inflammation and their regulation by oxidants. Further,
our studies are also highly relevant in understanding the immunopathology of chronic granulomatous disease, a
life-threatening immunodeficiency caused by inherited mutations in NADPH oxidase subunit genes."
10746012,"Abstract
 Apical extracellular matrix (aECM) coats the outward-facing surface of every organ, forming a barrier
between the organism and its environment. Although it has been viewed historically as a static layer,
aECM has been recently revealed to be dynamic across development and highly varied between cell
types. It plays important roles in shaping organ morphogenesis and modulating cell activity. Identifying
the regulatory mechanisms that control aECM composition and structure is therefore critical to
understanding its role in development. Further, because aECM is highly accessible, there is enormous
potential to manipulate it for targeted delivery of therapeutics or in tissue engineering. The major
obstacles to studying aECM remodeling are that changes in aECM are difficult to visualize and need to
be studied in vivo during highly dynamic processes that involve complex cell rearrangements. This
project overcomes these obstacles by using an innovative model of developmentally programmed aECM
remodeling. Preliminary data lead to the hypothesis that aECM structure is a discrete modular feature of
cell identity, analogous to neurotransmitter types in neurons, rather than a continuum of stiffness/density.
 The C. elegans cuticle is an aECM that forms barrier between the animal and its environment. In
order to directly access the external environment, the ciliated endings of some sensory neurons protrude
through nanoscale pores in the cuticle, while those of other sensory neurons are embedded in
specialized sheets of cuticle. Both types of cuticle structure are produced by glial cells that wrap the
sensory neuron endings. One of these glial cells offers a remarkable example of developmentally
programmed aECM remodeling: in juveniles of both sexes and in adult hermaphrodites it produces a
cuticle sheet, but in adult males it produces a cuticle pore. This represents a discrete aECM remodeling
event that occurs at a defined developmental stage without any major cell rearrangements. Preliminary
data show that this aECM remodeling event is accompanied by a switch in gene expression in the glial
cell. This includes expression of GRL-18, a novel class of aECM component that forms nanoscale rings
in the cuticle. These observations leads to the hypothesis that a developmentally regulated switch in
gene expression induces remodeling of aECM to form a nanoscale pore.
 To test this hypothesis, this project will (Aim 1) use mutant analysis and transcriptional profiling to
define the gene expression switch that accompanies aECM remodeling; (Aim 2) determine how a novel
developmentally regulated protein (GRL-18) contributes to aECM structure; and (Aim 3) test if changes
in expression of GRL-18 and co-regulated genes are sufficient to remodel aECM into a nanoscale pore."
10745963,"Diabetes affects 13% of US adults and African Americans (AAs) have higher prevalence of diabetes, higher
diabetes related cost, higher risk of complications, and higher risk of early death compared to non-Hispanic
Whites. A key factor that is emerging as a significant contributor to poor health outcomes for AAs is structural
racism. A component of structural racism is historical redlining and restrictive covenants that has forced AAs to
live in less-than-optimal neighborhoods in inner cities of most urban areas. A recent community-based case
study conducted by our team in Milwaukee identified a new paradigm for addressing health disparities in inner-
city environments. The study suggests that mass incarceration, residential segregation, violence, housing
instability, food insecurity, intergenerational poverty, and the limited educational opportunities that characterize
the lived experience of inner-city AAs create a state of chronic stress, which leads to poor health and increased
disability and ultimately leads to decreased human capital (defined as the intangible, yet integral, economically
productive aspects of individuals). A promising intervention that may address the underlying poverty related
chronic stress of structural racism and living in inner city environments for AAs with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is
Cash Transfer, which can be conditional or unconditional. Conditional cash transfers (CCTs) supplements
basic income conditional on performing certain health-related activities such as attending health education
classes or completing preventive care recommendations, whereas unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) are not
conditional on any required activities. However, CCTs and UCTs have not been tested in the United States as
a strategy to alleviate the poverty-related chronic stress that detract from effective self-care for chronic
diseases like T2DM in inner city AAs. This study will test the preliminary efficacy of diabetes-tailored CCT (DM-
CCT), which will be conditional on participating in biweekly (every two weeks), nurse-led, virtual diabetes
education/skills training and stress/coping intervention compared to UCT (with no requirement for participation)
on clinical outcomes, self-care behaviors, and psychological health in 100 inner city AAs with poorly controlled
T2DM using an RCT design. The aims of the proposed study include: AIM 1: Test the preliminary efficacy of
the DM-CCT intervention on glycemic control and quality of life for inner-city AAs with T2DM. AIM 2: Test the
preliminary efficacy of the DM-CCT intervention on self-care behaviors and psychological health for inner-city
AAs with T2DM. AIM 3: Estimate the cost of delivery of the DM-CCT and UCT interventions in preparation for
future cost effectiveness analysis."

The highly complex OUD and overdose epidemic poses a huge public health and economic burden. Current
FDA-approved pharmacotherapies against OUD and overdose use opioid receptor agonists and antagonists.
These therapies show overall limited efficacy, due to their side effects, suboptimal patient access and
compliance, and liability for abuse and diversion. Vaccines offer a new treatment option that is both alternative
and complementary to existing measures. Preclinical testing demonstrated anti-opioids vaccines as a highly
selective long-lasting treatment and prophylactic strategy that protects against opioid-induced antinociception,
motor activity, respiratory depression, bradycardia, and self-administration in pre-clinical models. Previous
clinical trials of addiction vaccines showed proof of efficacy in those subjects who achieved the highest antibody
(Ab) titers, highlighting the need to design more effective vaccines and understanding the basis for variability in
individual efficacy. Hence, this proposal focuses on developing next-generation nanoparticle-based anti-opioid
vaccines and deciphering molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying their efficacy. Our team developed a
novel lipid polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPNP) platform, that enhanced the efficacy of conjugate vaccines
against nicotine and oxycodone. Based on these preliminary data, we propose further dissecting the molecular
basis of this increased efficacy and testing how nanovaccines composition, and adjuvant display determine
innate and adaptive immune activation and whether specific cellular and molecular mechanisms underlie vaccine
efficacy against OUD. AIM1 will test the effect of different polymers and adjuvant display methods on efficacy of
nanovaccine against oxycodone. As well as how nanoformulation of conjugate vaccine affect the delivery and
bioavailability of vaccine components. Studies will investigate vaccine efficacy in mice, IgG antibody titer and Ig
subclass and vaccine kinetics in terms of biodistribution, accumulation and localization within spleen and lymph
nodes. AIM2 will elucidate whether different nanovaccine formulations show distinctions in innate and adaptive
immune responses. Studies will dissect innate immunity in vitro activation and in vivo dynamics in response to
vaccination, addressing key cell subsets contributing to efficacy, as well as assess the magnitude of B cell
responses. Results will provide a model vaccine that can be easily adapted to other abused substances. Such
information will guide future vaccine design and the rational selection of the most appropriate formulation for a
given antigen. The proposed mentored studies and this F31 fellowship are invaluable training and
professional development opportunity as I strive to become an independent scientist. This hypothesis-driven
multidisciplinary project encompasses various state-of-art approaches that are prerequisites to excel in
translational research at the interface of immunology, pharmacology and substance abuse. The mentorship of
NIDA-funded experts will ensure the successful completion of the proposed studies and the effective
communication of research findings to the scientific community."

Bladder cancer is a prevalent and deadly cancer, with over 80,000 new cases and 17,000 deaths annually in the
United States. Advanced bladder cancer has only a 15% 5-year survival rate. One of the most effective
treatments for advanced bladder cancer is immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), but only 20-30% of patients with
advanced bladder cancer respond and most responses are not enduring. A promising new treatment identified
by our group to improve bladder cancer ICB response is the selective class 1 histone deacetylase inhibitor
entinostat. In a mouse model, entinostat plus anti-PD-1 (αPD-1) ICB induced complete, enduring responses in
67% of mice. Entinostat decreased intratumoral M-MDSC and Treg populations, decreased tumor single-
nucleotide variant (SNV) neoantigen burden in vivo, increased expression of some SNV neoantigens in vitro,
and increased T cell specificity for these neoantigens in vivo. However, much of the mechanism behind response
to entinostat plus αPD-1 is unknown, particularly how entinostat decreases immunosuppressive populations and
affects expression of the neoantigen landscape. Understanding this mechanism is important to predict which
patients will respond and to potentially improve responses through antigen-directed therapy. We hypothesize
that entinostat-induced ICB response is driven by increased M-MDSC differentiation, decreased M-MDSC
migration, and increased expression of suppressed immunogenic neoantigens, augmenting response to
neoantigen vaccination. I will investigate two components driving response to entinostat plus αPD-1: M-MDSCs
and neoantigens. The training in computational and wet lab immunology, tumor biology and genetics, orthotopic
murine tumor models, and translational research with a clinical trial, will assist me in becoming an independently
funded physician-scientist leading a cancer immunology research lab and caring for bladder cancer patients.
In our M-MDSC-focused Aim 1, I will perform flow cytometry and transwell migration assays with M-MDSCs from
orthotopic bladder cancer model tumors to assess whether M-MDSC differentiation and migration are affected
by entinostat treatment. I will conduct immunofluorescence staining of human tumors from the LCCC1827
entinostat window trial (NCT03978624) to assess whether adding entinostat to ICB treatment decreases M-
MDSCs in humans. The Vincent Lab has developed LENS, a software platform to identify neoantigens from
multiple genomic sources. In our neoantigen expression-focused Aim 2, I will use LENS to identify all the
neoantigens in 3 murine bladder cancer lines developed by the Kim Lab, test T cell neoantigen specificity by
high-throughput ELISPOT, and use statistical modeling to predict neoantigens immunogenicity. I will also
validate whether entinostat-induced immunoediting occurs in human tumors from LCCC1827. In our neoantigen
vaccination-focused Aim 3, I will test whether neoantigen vaccination improves tumor response to entinostat
plus αPD-1. I will treat orthotopic tumors, measure their growth, and perform flow cytometry and single cell
RNAseq to measure non-exhausted neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cell abundance."

Thanks to life-extending HIV therapy, there are an estimated 7 million people with HIV (PWH) aged over 50
years worldwide; 5 million of them live in sub-Saharan Africa, the epicenter of the HIV epidemic. Of the
~312,000 PWH in Ghana in 2019, almost 1 in 6 is aged over 50 years. Geriatric syndromes (e.g., frailty,
multimorbidity) and discrete diseases of aging (e.g., hypertension) threaten these gains in healthier life
expectancy for aging PWH. These threats are particularly troubling in Ghana and sub-Saharan African
countries where access to geriatric care and chronic disease management is limited. Efforts underway in the
region leverage HIV care systems to diagnose and manage chronic diseases of aging. A gap in these efforts is
a focus on geriatric syndromes – multi-factorial clinical conditions, common in older PWH, that do not fit
discrete disease categories. Filling this gap, particularly in the sub-Saharan Africa region, is the next barrier to
extending quantity of life and preserving quality of life for aging PWH. To help fill this gap, our long-term goal is
to provide comprehensive care for geriatric syndromes and diseases of aging without over-diagnosing or over-
treating older PWH. The objectives of the current proposal are to 1) characterize frailty, multimorbidity, and
discrete diseases of aging in older PWH; and 2) identify barriers and facilitators to providing effective patient-
centered healthcare for older PWH. Frailty is associated with HIV, dependency and mortality. It is
characterized by diminished strength, endurance, and functioning. Multimorbidity – multiple, interacting
physical and mental health conditions – is associated with HIV, polypharmacy, morbidity and mortality. We
hypothesize that 1) frailty and multimorbidity are under-recognized and discrete cardiometabolic diseases are
under-diagnosed in older PWH in Ghana; and 2) Infectious Disease Unit referrals for discrete cardiometabolic
diseases are not effective for their management in Ghana. To test these hypotheses, we propose a longitudinal
observational study at the University Hospital Infectious Disease Unit, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science
and Technology (KNUST) in Kumasi, Ghana. The study will enroll 151 PWH who are 50 years and older to
address three specific aims: 1) Characterize frailty and multimorbidity in older PWH in care at the University
Hospital, KNUST; 2) Assess under-diagnosis and management of discrete cardiometabolic diseases in older
PWH; and 3) Identify barriers and facilitators to providing effective, patient centered healthcare to aging PWH.
KNUST Aging & HIV Outcomes (KAHO) study will help identify priorities and opportunities for building an
effective integrated model of HIV and geriatric healthcare in Ghana. This integrated model will extend the gains
in quality life expectancy for Ghanaians and other Africans in similar settings who are aging with HIV."
10933578,"Project Summary
 Programs to prevent vertical transmission of HIV have been extremely effective. As a result, there is an
increasing population of HIV-exposed and uninfected children (CHEU). Currently, at least one in every five
children (approximately 4.1 million children) in South Africa is HEU. These children face higher risks even
though they are not infected, exhibiting reduced growth, neurodevelopmental delays and increased risk of
severe infections and even death before age two years. In 2017, we started recruiting a cohort of pregnant
women living with HIV who had either commenced triple-regimen ART prior to conception or during pregnancy
immediately upon testing positive for HIV infection, along with uninfected women. We thus established a cohort
of infants in three study arms viz. unexposed, exposed with ART throughout fetal development, and exposed
with ART started later in pregnancy. In R01 HD085813, we imaged the children at 39-45 weeks equivalent
gestational age with MRI to assess brain development, and we performed cognitive and clinical assessments
at regular intervals. We observed structural, functional and metabolic differences in deep gray and white matter
in CHEU, and poorer cognitive performance at 10 and 20 months. In R01 HD093578, we additionally studied
the relationship between neuroimaging in infancy and between one and two years of age, and microbiome
markers of infant development, including infant nutrition and breastmilk, to establish the relationship between
gut microbial diversity, milk oligosaccharide composition and the brain. This study is ongoing.
 There is an urgent need to understand how and why children exposed to HIV are not thriving as well as
their unexposed peers. Early life factors around birth may have consequences throughout life. In this study we
will follow this well-characterized cohort established before birth to examine the effects of pre- and perinatal
HIV/ART exposure on neurodevelopment around ages 6 and 8 years, using multimodality neuroimaging
(morphometry, spectroscopy and connectivity) and clinical and cognitive assessments. This period is important
as the children start school at 7 years. We expect to enroll 150 children from the original infant cohort. Our data
will enable a longitudinal assessment of HIV/ART exposure on neurodevelopmental out-comes, and potential
moderation by environmental factors, infant nutrition and maternal well-being and health.
 We will continue to sustain the capacity for pediatric neuroimaging and cognitive assessment built up
over more than a decade of NIH-supported collaboration between Drs. Meintjes (University of Cape Town),
Laughton (Stellenbosch University) and van der Kouwe (Massachusetts General Hospital). We will build new
capacity for brain imaging in resource-limited settings by imaging our cohort with a low-field mobile MRI
scanner alongside the high-field scanner. With these comparative images we will develop longitudinal
morphometric analysis tools to discriminate between healthy and atypical neurodevelopment, making these
algorithms cloud-ready so that they are accessible to users with limited computing resources."
10916423,"Heart failure affects 2-3% of the US population and remains the single largest cause of mortality.
Despite the large unmet need, heart failure drug development is notoriously difficult, and few first-in-
class drugs have been approved in the past decade. Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-
based models of heart disease are widely considered to hold tremendous potential for the development
of heart failure drugs because they faithfully model disease phenotypes and reflect individual patient
genetics. However, their utility for drug screening is limited because the technology for assessing
disease modifying effects are too cumbersome and low throughput for large-scale screens.
Visualizing disease-modifying activity of genes and drugs for heart failure requires kinetic read outs of
cardiomyocyte function that correlate calcium (Ca2+) cycling with contractile force and resting tension
to reveal systolic and diastolic heart dysfunction. The lack of off-the-shelf solutions for simultaneous
measurement of these parameters is a critical gap that has hindered the pace of basic research into
disease mechanisms and drug development. Although modern high content imaging systems can
acquire the requisite fast kinetic datasets, the major roadblock is that available data analysis tools lack
key capabilities, are too low throughput, and/or require substantial coding expertise to implement in
large-scale genetic studies and drug discovery.
Resolving this roadblock will be transformative by placing powerful tools in the hands of scientists
without coding expertise, enabling them to develop gene and drug screens using iPSC and adult
cardiomyocyte models of heart failure. We will deliver an integrated toolbox of software, reagents, and
standardized protocols for contemporaneous measurement of intracellular and subcellular Ca2+
dynamics with contractile force and resting tension that can be overlaid with subcellular feature
detection – all compatible with 384-well plate format – to model systolic and diastolic heart function.
The software will have a user-friendly graphical user interface to fully automate measurements of Ca2+-
contractility force curves (in absolute µM and nN terms) from beating cardiomyocytes. A key feature
will be individual, cell-by-cell analysis that will increase dynamic range and allow the recognition of
cellular heterogeneity in the preparations making possible realistic culture models with multiple cell
types. We will also develop a toolkit of viral vectors to deliver genetically encoded sensors of absolute
intracellular Ca2+ concentrations in cardiomyocyte populations without generating stable cell lines. The
integrated platform will be validated and benchmarked against current software in pilot drug and gene
screens that demonstrate ability to quantify disease-modifying activities for systolic and diastolic heart
disease. Quantitative performance measures will evaluate assay readiness."

The development of brain-controlled prosthetic arms promises to provide independence to people with paralysis.
To date, however, Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have not conferred on users the ability to use the prosthesis
to carry out activities of daily living (ADLs) with adequate reliability and flexibility. This inability can be traced
back to at least three shortcomings. First, while we naturally closely coordinate arm and hand movements,
current BCI users reach and grasp sequentially, in large part due to the way BCI decoders are built. Second,
existing decoders use the component of the neuronal activity that has a direct and immediate relationship with
motor output to infer motor intent. While this approach has been successful even for control of an
anthropomorphic robotic arm and hand, it does not harness all the behaviorally relevant M1 activity. Indeed,
activity that has a direct and immediate relationship with behavior – the so-called output-potent activity –
constitutes only a small fraction of the total M1 activity. The remaining neuronal activity – so-called output-null
activity – plays a role in generating the output-potent activity but is overlooked by standard decoding approaches.
Third, while robotic hands have become increasingly sophisticated and anthropomorphic, no existing prototype
approaches the functionality of a human hand, either in terms of actuation or sensorization.
 The goal of the proposed project is to address each of the aforementioned limitations by building more
biomimetic decoders – that allow for coordinated arm and hand movements and more effectively harness M1
activity – and by challenging them in a flexible and realistic virtual reality platform. First, we will build decoding
approaches that support coordinated movements of the arm and hand. To this end, we will train decoders while
subjects reach to and grasp objects that differ in shape, size, and orientation, forcing significant hand orienting
and pre-shaping during reaching. Second, we will further elaborate these decoders so that they leverage both
output-potent and output-null activity. To this end, we will leverage recent insights into M1 dynamics and their
relationship to behavior to build decoders that harness all the behaviorally relevant activity in M1. Finally, we will
test novel decoders in VR by having subjects perform standard tests of arm and hand function as well as tasks
that mimic complex activities of daily living and develop performance metrics for these VR scenarios. We are
well positioned to achieve these objectives as part of a multi-site clinical trial on BCI with 3 subjects implanted
across two locations, with existing funding for two more subjects."
10973832,"Summary
Diet-induced obesity affects about 40 percent of US women and increases the incidence, morbidity, and
mortality of postmenopausal breast cancer (BC). Obesity also increases the risk of large, high-grade tumors,
metastasis, and recurrence regardless of menopausal status. Our long-term goal is to contribute to the
development of new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of obesity-associated human BC. Our research
proposal addresses this by interrogating the mechanisms by which dietary lipids accelerate BC tumor growth,
and whether BC in patients with obesity have unique metabolic vulnerabilities that can be leveraged
therapeutically. Supported by published evidence and our own preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that,
in settings of chronic dietary lipid overabundance such as obesity, BC cells are wired to utilize free fatty acids
(FFA) over glucose to support cancer lipid anabolism, resulting in accelerated tumor growth. The insulin
sensitivity and health of the adipose microenvironment dictate whether tumors source these lipids locally or
from systemic metabolism. We will test our central hypothesis by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Test if dietary
lipids, rather than glucose, are preferentially utilized by BC cells in lipid-rich environments, 2) Determine the
metabolic fate of absorbed fatty acids in breast tumors and 3) Assess the translational implications of an
altered metabolic program to the treatment of BC in patients with obesity. In aim 1, we will use different dietary
and genetic mouse models that can accelerate BC growth to quantify the relative uptake of dietary fuels and
their source in lean versus obese BC. In aim 2, we will use stable isotope infusions to trace the fates of dietary-
derived FFAs and establish their biochemical contributions to tumor growth. In aim 3, we will use
pharmacological inhibitors of lipolysis and circulating FFA-lowering agents to test the therapeutic potential of
restricting FFA supply for inhibiting tumor growth. We will also analyze the expression of lipid metabolism
genes in human BC stratified by body mass index as a measure of obesity status. Our approach, which
collectively addresses physiology, adipose biology, and tumor metabolism, is enabled by our combined
expertise in nutrition and metabolic status (Dr. Chaix), adipose tissue biology (Dr. Hilgendorf), and in vivo
stable isotope tracing to study tumor metabolism (Dr. Ducker). Together, we have established a system in
which BC tumor growth can be accelerated solely by the manipulation of circulating levels of lipids,
independent of adiposity and associated metabolic syndrome. This lipid-centric view of tumor metabolism
generates strong testable hypotheses for future therapeutic interventions. Specifically, we propose that
pharmacological and dietary interventions targeting cancer metabolism need to be optimized for the lipid
metabolic program of the tumors which is determined by the metabolic health of the patient."
10973834,"Evidence from human epidemiological studies and animal models reveals that chronic psychological stress influences the evolution, dissemination, and treatment results of neoplasia. Chronic stress is transduced into a physiological signal primarily via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Within the brain, corticotrophin-releasing hormone neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVNCRH neurons) integrate incoming sensory information and trigger glucocorticoid (GC) release from the adrenal gland. These neurons also promote the release of the adrenergic neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) throughout the body via the SNS. This positions PVNCRH neurons as central players in both the sensation and systemic response to stress. Cancer patients undoubtedly experience chronic stress (e.g., prognosis-related), and this stress is strongly linked to an increased risk of metastasis/recurrence. Yet, how stress promotes metastasis is poorly understood. Closing this knowledge gap is challenging given the involvement of multiple organ systems and the need to bridge different scientific disciplines. We assembled an interdisciplinary team to elucidate the mechanisms connecting stress and metastasis. By introducing chronic stress protocols in mouse models of metastatic breast and pancreatic cancer, we uncovered that HPA-axis-driven GC release triggers neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, which is crucial for stress-induced micro-metastasis establishment from disseminated cancer cells. Furthermore, we detected stress-induced SNS activation at the metastatic site. Notably, chronic stress also caused resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), likely via the actions of both GCs and NE. Finally, we found that the presence of metastasizing cancer itself hyperactivates PVNCRH neurons. Thus, our findings establish a maladaptive stress-metastasis feedforward loop involving the HPA axis, SNS, and immune system: stress ► PVNCRH neuron activation ► SNS & HPA-axis activation ► metastasis progression ► PVNCRH neuron hyperactivation. Here, we propose to investigate how stress impacts metastasis and ICB responses, and how metastasis, in turn, drives the activity of this feedforward loop. In Aim 1, we will address how GCs cause NET formation and how NETs promote metastasis. In Aim 2, we will determine how the SNS influences the response to ICB therapy, employing a novel technique to manipulate the sympathetic nerves that innervate metastases. Additionally, we will test if adrenergic receptor blockers improve ICB treatment responses in mice exposed to stress. In Aim 3, we will address how metastases changes the electrophysiological properties of PVNCRH neurons, allowing us to identify putative ion channel families altered by metastatic cancer. Our studies will provide mechanistic insights into the maladaptive stress-metastasis feedforward loop and have implications for preventing metastasis from disseminated cancer cells and for treating stage IV cancer. Moreover, we are breaking new ground by showing that the communication between cancer and the brain is bidirectional."
10745976,"SUMMARY
Chronic lung disease and complications from preterm birth are the leading pediatric contributors to years of life
lost in the USA. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease, is the most common sequela of
prematurity and is the leading respiratory cause of childhood morbidity. In the United States alone BPD
accounts for over $2.4 billion in healthcare costs annually. Ventilator induced lung injury (VILI) is an accepted
and important contributor to BPD. Exposure to oxygen and positive pressure ventilation leads to developmental
arrest and parenchymal injury in the immature preterm lung. Lung protective strategies therefore prioritize non-
invasive respiratory support for preterm infants with respiratory failure, but failure rates of non-invasive
respiratory support (ie: continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP]) are high. In meta-analysis of trials of nasal
non-invasive intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), synchronized NIPPV significantly reduced the
incidence of BPD when compared with CPAP. This benefit was not seen with non-synchronized NIPPV.
However, current standard means of synchronization are unreliable and do not deliver consistent
synchronization. Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA), an FDA approved technology, is a novel method
to synchronize non-invasive support (NIV) with infant respiratory drive. This effective non-invasive
synchronization matches electrical diaphragmatic activity to deliver synchronized and accurate tidal volumes in
proportion to the neural signal. In these clustered UG3/UH3 and U24 applications, we propose a pragmatic,
unblinded, Phase III, randomized controlled trial (RCT) in 358 preterm infants 240/7-276/7 weeks gestation in
respiratory failure to determine if NIV-NAVA, compared with non-synchronized nasal intermittent positive
pressure ventilation (NIPPV), will reduce the incidence of extubation failure within 5 days of extubation from
mechanical ventilation."
10750950,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Survivors of pediatric brain tumors often experience significant problems with social connectedness during
youth that have lasting effects as adults (e.g., reduced rates of marriage). However, the factors contributing to
these difficulties are unclear and little is known about how domains of social connectedness influence health-
related quality of life (HRQL) and psychological well-being over time in survivors of pediatric brain cancer.
Further, intervention efforts to address these issues have been limited by a lack of research on the underlying
risk and mechanistic factors of social connectedness. Candidate risk and mechanistic factors include age at
diagnosis, treatment, and treatment-related morbidities across many domains (e.g., cognitive, neurologic,
endocrine, metabolic). Additionally, brain cancer treatments disrupt neurodevelopmental processes that are
essential to social behavior, such as brain connectivity, face processing, and social attention. Establishing the
importance of social connectedness to overall health and the mechanistic processes contributing to social
connectedness impairments in pediatric brain cancer survivors is important in order to develop appropriate
interventions. The broad objectives of this proposal are to compare domains of social connectedness among
survivors of malignant brain tumors to survivors of non-malignant brain tumors, evaluate the influence of social
connectedness on HQRL and psychological well-being among survivors, and to evaluate risk and mechanistic
factors for the trajectory of social connectedness. We propose an innovative study of youth treated for
medulloblastoma (MB), cerebellar pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) or craniopharyngioma (CP) (N = 180; ages 8-16)
using a 2-year accelerated longitudinal design with annual visits with cohorts stratified by time since diagnosis.
Clinical differences between groups (e.g., malignant/non-malignant, use of craniospinal irradiation) allow for
tests of their unique impacts on social connectedness and for identification of potential intervention targets.
Participants will be recruited from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. At each study visit, participants will
complete measures of social connectedness, HRQL, and psychological well-being, as well as assessments of
body composition, neuroendocrine function, hearing, brain connectivity (e.g., MRI), social information
processing (SIP) and social behavior. Neuroimaging markers of interest include structural connectivity, resting
state functional connectivity, and functional connectivity in the social brain during social processing tasks. We
hypothesize that social connectedness, and thus HRQL and psychological well-being, are uniquely impacted in
MB survivors, and that risk (e.g., CSI) and mechanistic factors (e.g., hearing, social behavior) affect social
connectedness over time. We expect to establish deficits in social connectedness as a notable late effect in
survivors of medulloblastoma with significant impact on HRQL and well-being and to identify mechanisms of
social connectedness. By identifying the mechanisms underlying social connectedness, we can then develop
interventions that target key mechanistic factors and improve social connectedness, health, and well-being."

The global burden of mycobacterial infections remains staggering, with over 10 million new tuberculosis (TB)
cases and 1.2 million deaths in 2019, and a recent rising incidence of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM).
Treatment of both TB and NTM is hindered by the need for prolonged combination antibiotics, drug resistance,
toxicity, drug-drug interactions and sub-optimal efficacy. After decades without many new agents, there are
now concerted efforts to identify and integrate novel drugs, optimize existing drugs, and augment host immune
response. Clinical pharmacology, when integrated throughout drug development, defines critical relationships
between drug exposure and effect (or toxicity), identifies key interactions, and enhances treatment success.
However, to date, there is a dearth of physician scientists with dual training in infectious diseases and clinical
pharmacology who can champion these drug development efforts, especially for NTM.
In this proposal, the candidate will apply clinical pharmacology tools to the problem of mycobacterial
therapeutics and utilize the resources and framework of three funded clinical trials that are being led by
mentors and advisory committee members. Backed by a strong multidisciplinary advisory team with expertise
in clinical pharmacology, mycobacterial drug development, pharmacometrics, and mycobacteriology, the
candidate will 1) define the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (PK-PD) of azithromycin for Mycobacterium
avium complex (MAC) lung disease by applying the early bactericidal activity (EBA) trial design (Aim 1); 2)
identify predictors of toxicity for a novel nitroimidazole antibiotic using PK-toxicodynamic (PK-TD) modeling
(Aim 2); and 3) determine the magnitude of drug-drug interaction (DDI) between first-line TB treatment and
pravastatin as host-directed therapy (Aim 3). Each one of these aims will provide an opportunity to not only
learn but also implement pharmacologic analytical methods for the investigation of both TB and NTM. The
candidate will gain skills including population PK modeling, execution of early bactericidal activity trial design,
PK-toxicodynamic modeling, and development of a clinical toxicity prediction tool.
This K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award will serve not only to advance
research in mycobacterial therapeutics, but also support the candidate to gain the skills necessary to perform
fundamental and advanced clinical pharmacology analyses, lead clinical trials, and form strong multi-
institutional collaborations. Upon completion of this K23, the candidate will be well positioned as an
independent clinical investigator with expertise in infectious diseases, applied antimycobacterial pharmacology,
and NTM therapeutics."
10748490,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Background: Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing only modestly reduces
the number of deaths at the expense of increasing the morbidity associated with overdiagnosed cases and
unnecessary treatment. As a result, clinical guidelines recommend against universal PSA screening for men
but do call for shared decision making (SDM). SDM involves discussing the benefits and harms of interventions
and incorporating patient preferences into decisions. Effective SDM requires healthcare systems-level support,
promotion of SDM skills for practitioners and patients, as well as context-specific knowledge for all involved.
Without proper planning for and support for providers to implement SDM and patients to participate, such
guideline-recommended discussions cannot be expected. Meanwhile, the next frontier in cancer screening is a
new paradigm of precision screening, in which an individual’s genetic make-up may be used to stratify their
level of future cancer risk and inform whether, how early, and how often they should be screened. Polygenic
risk scores (PRS) are composite risk estimates derived from large, population-based genome-wide association
studies. The goal of incorporating PRS into population screening is to reduce the harms of overdiagnosis and
unnecessary treatment for low-risk individuals while preserving screening benefits for those at highest risk.
Significance: Both precision screening and SDM are major pillars of the new White House Cancer Moonshot
v2.0. PRS-informed prostate cancer screening is likely to be the first of these precision screenings within the
Veterans’ Health Administration (VHA). Our project is also clearly aligned with VHA’s patient-centered learning
initiative to turn VHA into a health literate care organization.
Innovation and Impact: This clinical innovation will have direct impact on primary care, where cancer
screening decisions are made. The limited genetic counseling workforce is not sufficient to offload all
conversations about PRS from patient-aligned care teams (PACTs) in which primary care providers (PCPs)
work. The potential effect of PRS-guided screening on equity is also a concern. Current guidelines consider
Black race risk factor that might favor PSA screening, as Black men are twice as likely to die of prostate cancer
than white men. Any new screening paradigm must consider existing disparities and a historical context of
racial discrimination and mistrust for a prostate cancer PRS is to be accepted among racially diverse patients.
Specific Aims: To proactively address VHA’s needs in implementing a prostate cancer PRS using SDM into
primary care, we propose the following aims: 1) Qualitatively describe Veterans’ decision support needs to
discuss PRS and use them in SDM about prostate cancer screening; 2) Qualitatively describe and
quantitatively determine the perceived competency, perceived barriers, and informational and support needs
for implementing SDM around precision prostate cancer screening among VHA PACT members nationally;
and, 3) Engage with our operational partners and stakeholders in Intervention Mapping for the development of
a multifaceted intervention, implementation plan, and evaluation plan to support PACT members and Veterans
to engage in high-quality SDM around precision cancer screening.
Methodology: Aim 1 and 2 will include qualitative interviews with Veterans (Aim 1; n=40) and PACT member
interviews (Aim 2; n=45). Aim 2 also includes a national survey of PACT PCPs and nurses. Aim 3 consists of
Intervention Mapping: a process that engages stakeholders and results in intervention development and
implementation and evaluation plans. This third aim is not human subjects research.
Next Steps/Implementation: By the end of this project period, our operational partners will be prepared to
refine all intervention components and have feasible, stakeholder-informed implementation and evaluation
plans to incorporate SDM and PRS into real-world prostate cancer screening discussions with patients."

Transplantation is the most effective treatment for end-stage organ diseases. Clinically, two important risk factors
for poor transplant outcomes are the pre-transplant presence of donor-reactive T cells in the recipient and the
length of graft cold ischemic storage (CIS) time prior to transplant. In kidney transplant patients, the pre-
transplant presence of circulating donor-reactive memory T cells is associated with an increased risk of acute
rejection episodes, delayed and decreased graft function and worse long-term graft survival. In unsensitized
recipients, donor-reactivity of memory T cells is due to heterologous (cross-reactive) immunity. However, the
mechanisms activating donor-reactive endogenous memory T cells within allografts to mediate acute graft injury
remain poorly understood. Prolonged CIS increases ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), which is characterized by
production of reactive oxygen species and proinflammatory cytokines that direct infiltration of recipient leukocytes
into the graft and cause activation of these cells within the graft. IRI also induces the graft to release damage
associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from injured and dying cells that exacerbate inflammation and contribute
to worse outcomes in higher risk allografts. We previously showed that these two risk factors for poor transplant
outcomes are linked. The sustained high-inflammatory environment seen following transplant of cardiac
allografts subjected to prolonged CIS is necessary for sufficient activation of donor-reactive memory T cells to
mediate costimulatory blockade resistant acute rejection in unsensitized recipients. Multiple clinical transplant
studies have shown that one DAMP, cell-free DNA is elevated in the circulation during allograft injury,
representing a promising non-invasive biomarker for early detection of acute rejection. Additionally, recent work
from our collaborators has found new, pharmacologically targetable signaling partners required for activation of
innate immune sensors of cell free DNA, such as TLR9 which can recognize mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). These
findings and our current preliminary data have led us to hypothesize that prolonged CIS and subsequent
increased IRI enhance the release of mtDNA, leading to greater TLR9 activation and downstream type I IFN
production, triggering a pro-inflammatory cycle that is sustained by endogenous donor-reactive memory T cell
mediated acute graft injury. This hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims using our vascularized mouse
heterotopic heart transplant model: first, we will test modulation of TLR9 signaling in vivo to assess impact on
donor-reactive memory T cell mediated acute graft injury; and second, we will test the mechanism(s) by which
type I interferon contributes to early post-transplant inflammation and activation of donor-reactive T cells to
mediate rejection. We anticipate that these studies will identify new targets for therapeutic strategies to improve
solid organ transplant outcomes by inhibiting innate immune-mediated early activation of endogenous donor-
reactive memory T cells to cause acute graft injury."

Compromised intestinal barrier function and alterations in intestinal microbes are critical factors contributing to
many autoinflammatory diseases such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), celiac disease and Type 1
diabetes, and affect ~24 million Americans (www.niehs.nih.gov). Genetic contributions to these diseases
include the increased association with loss-of-function single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the protein
tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) gene. Moreover, PTPN2 was identified as a major
influence on microbiome composition across multiple patient cohorts.In mice constitutively lacking Ptpn2, we
identified substantial changes in gut microbiota populations highlighted by increased abundance of a novel
mouse adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC). This mouse AIEC was able to colonize mouse intestine, exacerbate
colitis onset, and delay recovery from colitis. Moreover, we now report that PTPN2 loss compromises Paneth
cells which have critical roles in preserving intestinal mucosal-microbial homeostasis. We also identify that
epithelial PTPN2 deletion reduces Paneth cell antimicrobial peptide expression, and increases susceptibility to
pathogen infection. Thus, we hypothesize that PTPN2 serves as a “microbial modulator” by regulating innate
defense mechanisms of epithelial cells to protect the intestine against bacterial ‘dysbiosis’, including expansion
of, and colonization with, the disease-relevant pathobiont, AIEC. The goals of this proposal are to determine
how loss of PTPN2 activity disrupts i) Paneth cell antimicrobial properties; and ii) how does PTPN2 regulate
other (non-Paneth cell) features of epithelial antimicrobial defense and intracellular bacterial handling.
Expected Outcomes & Impact: This proposal will increase our broader understanding of the molecular basis by
which host factors preserve the intestinal barrier and microbial homeostasis, and lead to development of new
approaches and targets to restore host-microbe relationships in diseases such as IBD."

Transposons are mobile pieces of DNA that comprise significant proportions of eukaryotic genomes, including
around 45% of the human genome and 30% of the fly genome. While most transposons have lost the ability to
jump into new locations in the genome, several in each organism maintain the ability to mobilize. New transposon
insertions are particularly consequential if they are generated in germline cells. Germline insertions are
subsequently present in every cell of the organism they develop into and can be passed on to future generations.
Thus, germline cells employ multilayered mechanisms to repress transposons. These repressive mechanisms
are essential to largely suppress transposon for development of germline cells into mature eggs and sperm
because transposon activity can contribute to sterility. Since these repressive mechanisms like the piRNA
pathway render transposition events so rare, they are difficult to detect and our understanding of how
transposons mobilize in the germline remains incomplete. Namely, the host factors that transposons employ to
generate new insertions and the time point when they make new insertions during sperm maturation are
undefined. To find potentially active transposons in the male germline, I have sequenced circular DNA from
Drosophila testes with the piRNA pathway depleted. Disrupting the piRNA pathway allowed for transposon
activation and revealed that the nomad transposon generates the most circular DNA in the testes. Circular DNA
is a transposition intermediate of LTR retrotransposons and its presence can indicate the likelihood of a
transposon being able to still make new insertions. With the knowledge that nomad is the most active transposon
in the male germline, I propose to use this transposon to study how transposons mobilize in the germline. I
hypothesize that transposons utilize host factors from the alt-EJ DNA repair pathway to achieve stage specific
mobilization during spermatogenesis. I will utilize circular nomad DNA as a readout to find host factors required
for its production and transposition reporters for nomad to precisely identify when it generates new insertions."

CD1 proteins are structurally related to MHC class I, but instead of peptides, they present lipid antigens to T
cells. We and others have shown that CD1-restricted T cells recognizing self-lipids are abundant in the human
T cell repertoire, yet it remains unclear how the activation of these T cells is regulated in vivo. Overt reactivity to
self-lipids suggests that antigenic CD1-lipid complexes must be tightly regulated in order to prevent continuous
T cell stimulation. Both fatty acids and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) have been identified as antigens for certain
human CD1-restricted T cells. These lipids are released when the enzyme phospholipase A2 (PLA2) acts on
membrane phospholipids, supporting a role for PLA2 activity in the generation of CD1 self antigens. Since
secreted PLA2 (sPLA2) is increased in response to tissue damage and infections, we hypothesize that sPLA2
activity in humans is a common mechanism through which the activation of CD1-restricted T cells is regulated,
by temporarily increasing the availability of CD1 self-lipid antigens. This is supported by our preliminary
observations that PLA2 activity on antigen presenting cells results in CD1-dependent T cell activation in healthy
individuals. Furthermore, since sPLA2 levels are constitutively elevated in many chronic inflammatory conditions,
including rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, atherosclerosis and psoriasis, this mechanism may underlie persistent T
cell activation in these conditions through continued high levels of self lipid antigens. In this proposal we will
systematically investigate the link between sPLA2 activity and activation of lipid-specific T cell populations, and
characterize the human CD1-restricted T cell populations that respond to PLA2-derived phospholipid breakdown
products. Using T cell cultures and a human skin explant model, we will determine if PLA2 activity induces the
activation/expansion of lysophospholipid-reactive T cell populations. We will investigate the breadth of the human
lysophospholipid-specific T cell repertoire, and its specificity/promiscuity. For this we use a panel of
lysophospholipid-loaded CD1 tetramers, and a CD1 plate assay. Last, we will apply combined single cell TCR
sequencing and functional phenotyping to CD1-LPC tetramer+ T cells isolated from healthy donors and psoriasis
patients, to determine if these populations primarily have pro-inflammatory or immunoregulatory functions, and
whether clonal expansions occur in the context of inflammatory skin disease. This proposal will provide insight
in whether sPLA2 activity is a significant driver of human CD1-restricted T cell activation, and will elucidate the
specificities and functions of the responding T cell populations. Because sPLA2 activity is central to both acute
and chronic inflammation, results from this study will lead to a better understanding of a common physiological
pathway through which T cells can be activated in multiple distinct inflammatory conditions, and provide novel
insights in modes through which lipid-specific T cell activation may be regulated therapeutically."

Brain metastases (BMs) are a life-threatening neurological disease, but current treatment regimens cannot
manage multiple (>4) BMs (mBMs) without causing strong adverse effects. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS),
utilizing potent dose to irradiate BMs and quick dose falloff to spare nearby tissues, has proven to be an effective
treatment regimen for limited-number and small-size BMs. However, SRS could not avoid high toxic dose when
BMs are multiple, clustered, or adjacent to critical organs. To safe and effectively treat mBMs with SRS requires
addressing these urgent needs: 1) to identify the maximum tolerable SRS dose; 2) to study neurocognitive
decline and design strategies to preserve patients’ post-treatment quality of life; and 3) to develop and implement
high-quality streamlined mBMs SRS treatment and follow-up care.
To address mBMs SRS management needs, we aim to develop and implement an artificial intelligence (AI)-
driven treatment planning system (TPS) and conduct a therapeutic intervention clinical trial, both dedicated to
improve mBMs SRS treatment quality and efficiency. The AI-driven TPS, namely AimBMs, will have three AI-
based computational modules, including AI-Segtor for automatic segmentation, AI-Predictor for treatment
outcome prediction and AI-Planner for spatiotemporal distributed SRS plan optimization. AimBMs is initially
developed based on retrospective data and facilitate the mBMs distributed SRS prospective phase I/II clinical
trials, while the clinical trial will provide critical clinical knowledge and evidence as feedback to improve AimBMs
performance. The ultimate goal of the project is to translate the AimBMs to routine clinical practice to improve
mBMs SRS treatment quality, patients’ post-treatment QoL, and clinical facility workflow.
In response to PAR-18-560, we have formed a multidisciplinary collaboration between radiation oncologists and
medical physicists to develop a novel AI-driven distributed SRS technology and conduct a cancer-targeted
therapeutic intervention for managing mBMs. The project’s innovations include: 1) novel SRS treatment planning
technological capability enabled by AI-based auto-segmentation, treatment outcome prediction, and
spatiotemporal plan optimization; 2) novel AI learning capability to improve developed AI tools’ performance
through the coherent clinical trial. The technology development will support the therapeutic intervention clinical
trial, while the clinical trial is designated to improve the developed system performance. This seamlessly
integrated development mode ensures the developed system is clinically practical. Upon completion, our newly
developed AimBMs will lay a solid foundation for mBMs SRS management and benefit a wide population of
patients with BMs. Moreover, the AI-based treatment planning and treatment delivery infrastructure built for
mBMs SRS can be transferred to other tumor sites to generate an even broader clinical impact."
10749027,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Fructose consumption is not only a major risk factor for development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD),
but also promotes hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis in humans and rodents. Identification of the
mechanisms linking NAFLD to cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains poorly understand. This proposal focuses
on identifying the influence dietary fructose has on synthesis and metabolism of cholesterol. Using a mouse
model of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption, the candidate shows that fructose metabolism increases
citrate, acetyl-CoA, and hepatic cholesterol levels. In addition, the candidate demonstrates fructose decreases
the protein expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (Cpt1a), a mitochondrial fatty acid transport protein.
Moreover, conditional CPT1a knockout mice exhibit similar lipid perturbations as mice fed fructose. Therefore,
aim 1 utilizes dual stable isotope techniques coupled with NMR and mass spectrometry to quantify cholesterol
synthesis and fructose-derived carbon enrichment into the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway in male and female
mice. Livers from the mice will be used for acetyl-proteomics to delineate potential mechanisms linking fructose
to cholesterol biosynthesis. Aim 2 determines how transcriptional regulation of Cpt1a alters fructose-induced
suppression of fatty acid oxidation and enhanced cholesterol synthesis using both in-vitro and in-vivo
approaches. The purpose of this aim is to uncover a previous unrecognized role of Cpt1a in coordinating the
regulation of both lipid-signaling pathways (fatty acid oxidation and cholesterol synthesis) in response to fructose.
Completion of these aims will yield mechanistic insight linking dietary sugar metabolism to hypercholesterolemia.
The novelty of the proposed research is the comprehensive dual-stable isotope approach in conjunction with
analytical techniques to measure cholesterol synthesis and fructose-derived carbon enrichment into the sterol
synthesis pathway in the same cohort of animals. In addition, the proposed research reveals several innovative
mechanisms that have yet to be explored, including acetylation of cholesterol synthesis enzymes and regulation
of Cpt1a through transcriptional mechanisms. Strong collaborations among the Metabolomics Core at the
University of Kentucky, Mass Spectrometry Core at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, and scientific
advisory committee members ensure successful completion of the proposed research by the candidate. This
research is complimented by a career development plan in which the candidate will learn new experimental
methodology in stable isotope metabolomics, broaden his scientific network through attending workshops and
conferences, and develop his communication skills so that he is poised to become an independent investigator.
This K01 award will allow him to reach his long-term goals of establishing a well-funded laboratory studying
dietary mechanisms in cardiometabolic disease."

The overall objective of this proposal is to find a new, more effective treatment for Chagas disease (CD). This
neglected tropical disease (NTD) is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, affecting 6-8 million people worldwide, mainly
in Latin America. CD is also an emerging public health concern in the U.S. Currently, there are only two drugs
(benznidazole and nifurtimox) available, which are very efficient to treat acute CD, but only partially effective for
chronic CD (CCD). There is no prophylactic or therapeutic human vaccine. These facts underscore the urgent
need for new therapeutics for CCD, the infection stage with the vast majority of cases. Here, we propose to
develop an immunochemotherapeutic platform by combining an effective vaccine with parasite-specific drug(s)
to treat CCD. This approach has been particularly successful in the treatment of cancer and leishmaniasis, and
it was recently tried in the context of acute CD, but not CCD, with relative success. The PI (Dr. Maldonado) has
discovered both the vaccine (MASPpep-KLH) and the drug candidates (T. cruzi N-myristoyltransferase [TcNMT]
inhibitors) to be studied in this proposal. We hypothesize that MASPpep-KLH plus an adjuvant, in combination
with the novel TcNMT inhibitors (DDD1 and DDD5), will have a synergistic effect, conferring greater efficacy
against chronic T. cruzi infection in comparison to single-mode therapies. Our ultimate goal is to generate sterile
elimination of the parasite in the murine model of CCD. We propose the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1.
To enhance the MASPpep-KLH vaccine platform utilizing an immunostimulatory adjuvant. MASPpep-KLH
will be tested in combination with an adjuvant to enhance the efficacy of MASPpep-KLH as therapeutic vaccine
in a murine model of CCD. Specific Aim 2. To assess the antiparasitic activity of novel NMT inhibitors
DDD1 and DDD5 in the murine model of CCD. We propose to evaluate the antiparasitic effectiveness of the
NMT inhibitors in the murine model of CCD. In the case the drugs do not induce 100% cure, they still will be
useful in Specific Aim 3, since suboptimal dose will be used to seek for synergistic effect in the
immunochemotherapy platform. Specific Aim 3. To determine the therapeutic potential of the
immunochemotherapy platform using DDD1 and/or DDD5 NMT inhibitors combined with MASPpep-KLH
(+/- adjuvant) for the treatment of CCD. As proof-of-concept of the immunochemotherapeutic platform, we
propose to conduct the initial experiments using suboptimal doses of benznidazole, the standard drug for CD, in
combination with MASPpep-KLH (+/- adjuvant). We will then measure and optimize the antiparasitic activity of
the combined therapy: NMT inhibitors plus MASPpep-KLH (+/-adjuvant) in a murine model of CCD, by evaluating
parasitemia, histopathology, and the humoral and cellular immune response profiles. This project is unique in
the use of a novel T. cruzi vaccine candidate and anti-parasitic NMT inhibitors. The successful completion of our
research will advance new therapeutic strategies against CCD, which will be essential for the control and
eradication of this NTD."

Natural sounds contain rapid fluctuations in the amplitude envelope, and detecting these changes is an im-
portant task of the auditory system. Early auditory structures such as the cochlear nucleus primarily encode
amplitude modulations (AMs) in sound by phase locking their firing to the AM waveform, while the auditory cor-
tex primarily uses changes in firing rate to encode AM modulation frequencies. Located in the middle of the
ascending auditory pathway, the inferior colliculus (IC) plays a critical role in transforming the temporal code of
the periphery to the rate code that predominates in the thalamus and cortex. However, little is known about the
cellular mechanisms that underlie the shift from temporal to rate coding of AM stimuli in the IC. The overall ob-
jective of this proposal is to determine how NMDA receptors (NMDARs) contribute to the transition from tem-
poral to rate codes in the IC. NMDARs are glutamate receptors that are prominently expressed in the IC and
that prolong the time window for synaptic integration due to their slow kinetics compared to AMPA receptors.
These properties make NMDARs strong candidates for supporting a temporal to rate code transition. Con-
sistent with this, previous work showed that blocking NMDARs flattened firing rate AM tuning curves in the IC
while leaving temporal coding intact. Furthermore, while most NMDARs in the brain require depolarization to
relieve Mg2+ block, many IC neurons exhibit NMDAR responses at resting potential, which is expected to en-
hance their capacity to prolong the time window for synaptic integration. Our preliminary data provide the first
molecular mechanism for this phenomenon, showing that many IC neurons express NR2C or NR2D subunits,
NMDAR subunits which confer decreased sensitivity to Mg2+ block and enable NMDARs to activate at resting
membrane potential. We also found that NR2D subunits are expressed in VIP neurons, a recently identified
class of IC principal neurons, providing us a tool to reliably access a population of NR2D-expressing neurons.
Our preliminary data show that NR2D-containing NMDARs facilitate synaptic integration in VIP neurons in
vitro. We therefore hypothesize that NR2C/NR2D-containing NMDARs facilitate a shift from temporal to rate
coding in the IC by enhancing the time window for synaptic integration of phase-locked ascending inputs and
transforming those into a rate code. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1 we will record in vitro from VIP neurons in
the IC and use optogenetics, pharmacology, and dynamic clamp experiments to determine how NR2D-contain-
ing NMDARs influence synaptic integration. In Aim 2, we will use pharmacology and in vivo recordings in
awake mice to test how rate coding for AM stimuli in the IC is shaped by NR2C/NR2D-containing NMDARs.
Overall, our results will reveal cellular mechanisms underlying the shift from temporal to rate coding in the IC,
which will help us better understand how AMs in sound are encoded in the brain and facilitate better interven-
tions for those with hearing loss."
10747500,"Background: Through the Choice Act of 2014 and the Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening
Integrated Outside Networks (MISSION) Act of 2018, the Veterans Affairs (VA) health system has substantially
expanded its role as a purchaser of care with greatly increased opportunities for Veterans to receive care
outside VA and in the community. Emergency department (ED) visits and related hospitalizations now
represent the largest provision of community-based care, costing over $4 billion to VA in fiscal year 2021—
more than 5 times greater than the next category of community care—and with nearly 50% more ED use
compared to the previous year, but with uncertain return on that spending.
Significance: Current approaches are inadequate for understanding the overall value of ED care for Veterans.
Episode of care models, however, a central strategy for measuring population level utilization and quality
associated with the full treatment of an illness, are a promising method for characterizing Veteran ED care both
in the community and VA with the goal of identifying sources of variability and opportunities for improvement.
Yet these models are not available for ED care or for emergency conditions and concerns common to
Veterans.
Innovation & Impact: Our proposed research represents a departure from the status quo and previous
attempts to understand differences in ED practice patterns for Veterans receiving care. Our study will unlock
critical insight and substantially move the field forward by evaluating differences in resource use, quality, and
care fragmentation patterns indicating opportunities for improvement in emergency care delivery that ultimately
shorten the standard cycle of meaningful and successful interventions for widespread adoption within VA.
Specific Aims: (1) To define a set of highly promising ED-based episodes of care for common conditions
experienced by Veterans; (2) To assess resource use and quality in ED-based episodes of care beginning in
the VA vs community setting; (3) To evaluate care fragmentation within ED-based episodes of care in the VA
vs community setting.
Methodology: Using the national VA datamart, we will define care episodes beginning with the ED visit for
several important Veteran conditions: congestive heart failure, chest pain, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, pneumonia, and suicidality. Employing a technical expert panel with a modified Delphi method, we will
determine inclusion and exclusion criteria, standardize risk-adjustment methods, and establish the validity of
these episode definitions. Then, using national VA and non-VA Community Care data and the methodologies
developed in Aim 1, we will apply ED-based care episodes and test for differences in patient utilization and
quality. Finally, we will test for associations between Veteran resource use and quality as developed in Aim 2
with indicators of care fragmentation, an important opportunity for intervention, in Aim 3.
Next Steps/Implementation: Discoveries derived from this proposed study will directly address the critical
knowledge gap facing VA operational leaders in understanding the value of ED purchased community care
relative to VA ED care. Once this project has proven the concept of ED-based episodes of care, these findings
can inform VA administrative decisions to systematically reveal opportunities for improvement and spotlight
high value targets of intervention. Ultimately, Veterans will derive the greatest benefit as we accelerate our
understanding of innovative strategies to maximize the quality and safety of ED care practices."

Although there have been improvements in the under age five mortality rate (U5MR) and neonatal mortality
rate (NMR) in Indian children, the burden of death in this population is still one live births to deaths. To achieve
the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for the U5MR and NMR rate, there is still an urgent need
for improvement in pre-pregnancy through childhood care in India and globally. The overarching goal of
Boston University (BU) and Lata Medical Research Foundation's (LMRF) Global Network (GN) for Women's
and Children's Health Research Unit (RU) is to continue to collaborate with other GN RUs on research to
improve health outcomes for women and children in low- and lower middle-income countries (LMIC). We have
had a GN RU in Nagpur, India continuously since 2008. Our RU is in the eastern part of the State of
Maharashtra (center of India) where NMR and infant mortality rates are higher than the overall rates in the
state and many other parts of India. Our RU involves a partnership between multiple Schools and Departments
(particularly Global Health, Obstetrics, Pediatrics, and Infectious Diseases) at Boston University and the
academic medical institutional consortium led by the LMRF in Nagpur, that provides clinical, research expertise
and infrastructure support. Since 2008, our RU has been successfully implementing studies, by patient and
public involvement and engagement strategy, that exemplify Global Network's goals to conduct high-impact
clinical trials and observational studies of sustainable, cost-effective health interventions and their
implementation in women and children in LMICs, and building sustainable professional capacity and
infrastructure for infectious diseases (maternal and pediatric), obstetric, neonatal and pediatric research. In the
current cycle of the GN, we have participated in all common protocols, and have maintained high recruitment
and retention rates. We have led 5 research initiatives, including developing a new socioeconomic status
index, and studying the risk of maternal, fetal and neonatal adverse outcomes associated with exposure to
household air pollution, Caesarian Section delivery and Maternal Depression. We have also had a leadership
role in the Azithromycin trial sub-study on risk of acquiring Azithromycin resistance using novel microbiome,
metagenomics and whole genome sequencing approaches, which required helping develop lab capacity in
several GN sites. We have jointly and successfully mentored 20 junior faculty, fellows and students who have
led site specific and GN wide publications. continue growth and development of the Nagpur RU, advance the
research network in the region, and sustain the research infrastructure for the design and conduct of public
health research in the Nagpur academic institutions; strengthen research focused on the leading causes of
morbidity and mortality in pregnancy and early childhood in the GN and in the Nagpur area by public and
patient engagement; and continue to identify and address gaps in maternal and child research."

Perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) is a short-chain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) used in industrial
and consumer products, such as aqueous film forming foam (AFFF), food wrappers, stain repellants on furniture,
and makeup. PFHxA use is not regulated in the United States. PFHxA is found ubiquitously in the environment
significantly contaminating soil and water resulting in humans being exposed through ingestion. Epidemiology
literature has reported PFHxA in maternal serum and breastmilk, and PFHxA crosses the placenta. Together,
these data demonstrate that fetuses are exposed through the placenta and infants through breast feeding. In
humans, PFHxA accumulates higher in the cerebellum than in most other brain regions. The cerebellum is critical
to both motor and cognitive functions, is the home of 50% of the neurons, has a unique cytoarchitecture, and
develops later than other regions making it an important region to study in the context of developmental toxicant
exposures. While the health effects of PFHxA are still largely unstudied, it is well established that legacy PFAS
alter immune function, including suppressing peripheral immune responses. However, the effects of PFHxA on
the immune cells of the brain, microglia, have not been investigated. Microglia have the same mesodermal
origins as peripheral immune cells, suggesting that developmental exposures may target microglial function.
Interestingly, microglia in the cerebellum may be particularly sensitive to neurotoxicants compared to microglia
in other brain regions as they have a unique transcriptomic profile. In addition to immune function, microglia play
a critical role in brain development by aiding in angiogenesis, providing factors for myelin development, and
pruning synapses thereby remodeling neural circuits. Thus developmental PFHxA exposure could affect their
immune and neuroanatomical functions. Despite the importance of microglia in brain development and evidence
that PFHxA enters the brain, PFHxA has not been investigated in the mammalian nervous system. Based on
evidence from epidemiology studies on PFHxA as well as long-chain PFAS, I hypothesize that gestational and
lactational exposure to PFHxA in a mouse model disrupts cerebellar development, affecting neuronal and glial
phenotypes, as well as motor activity. Microglia may be uniquely affected by this exposure, becoming
immunosuppressed. To test this hypothesis, I will pursue two aims using a mouse model representing human
exposure to PFHxA during gestation and lactation. The first aim will investigate how gestational and lactational
exposure to PFHxA affects neuron and glia phenotypes using RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry
(IHC). This aim will also investigate how this exposure affects animal behaviors, especially those related to the
cerebellum. The second will determine if microglia are altered at the genetic, protein, and dynamic level by using
RNA sequencing, IHC, and two-photon microscopy. These experiments will show, for the first time, whether
PFHxA exposure during brain development is neurotoxic and will also guide regulators from multiple agencies
when considering PFHxA exposure to humans."

The extracellular matrix (ECM) provides a scaffold for cardiac structural integrity and plays an active role in
modulating cellular responses. ECM consists of a network of fibrillar proteins and proteoglycans binding cyto-
kines, growth factors, and ECM-modifying enzymes. The aging heart develops interstitial fibrosis, and prelimi-
nary data demonstrate that different proteins are enriched in ECM in the male and female heart. An altered
ECM can affect cellular phenotypes. The ECM-cell communication occurs via cell surface receptors such as
integrins, through outside-in signaling, where integrin-binding to ECM protein domains translates into prolifera-
tion, differentiation, or gene expression. On the other hand, activation of the intracellular integrin tail increases
their ECM-binding affinity, promoting adhesion, migration, or ECM assembly (by inside-out signaling). There-
fore, ECM dictates a cellular phenotype, but cells can modify ECM in response by changing its composition or
assembly. Because of profound differences in ECM composition in males and females, we hypothesize that the
quality of repair assembled after injury and subsequent adverse remodeling in males and females will also be differ-
ent, and the differences will be accentuated by aging. In SA1, we will map the differences in ECM dependent on
age (young and old animals will be studied), sex hormone level (animals will be subjected to chemical ovary
failure or castration) or level of inflammation (CCL2KO animals will be used; these mice have reduced leuko-
cyte infiltration and therefore reduced fibrosis). The cellular phenotype of fibroblasts, endothelial cells (ECs),
and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) isolated from all these animals will be studied ex vivo and in 3D culture. The
effect of ECM on cell phenotype will be tested in 3D cultures using the matrix swap approach, where i.e. young
cells will be cultured on ECM from the old hearts and vice versa. And the effect of matrix stiffness on the pro-
duction of ECM protein will be examined as well. Similarly, the physiology of human cells will be studied. In
SA2, we will examine ECM-integrin dependent phenotypic changes in mouse and human cells. We will first
examine the effect of sex hormones, age, and inflammation on the levels of integrin expression in fibroblasts,
ECs, and SMCs. Then we will manipulate the integrin expression level (via downregulation or overexpression),
and examine the cellular phenotype. Finally, we will manipulate estrogen and androgen receptors and deter-
mine the effect of these manipulations on integrin levels and ECM protein synthesis. In SA3, we will examine
how sex hormone levels and age affect scar formation and adverse remodeling after ischemia/reperfusion inju-
ry. Changes in ECM will be examined via ELISA, mass spectrometry, and western blot. The approach is inno-
vative because it examines the role of three superimposed variables (age, sex hormone, and inflammation) on
ECM and cellular phenotypes. Successful completion of these studies will provide a mechanistic link for future
therapeutics targeting insufficient reparative and excessive adverse fibrosis."

 Nearly one-fifth of the Unites States population resides in a rural region, and approximately one-fifth of those
residents suffers from a mental illness. While these rates of mental illness are similar to urban areas, individuals
living in rural regions face a disproportionate burden of negative psychiatric outcomes. Modern advances in
psychiatric research have focused on using machine learning and human neuroimaging to predict diagnoses
and treatment outcomes. However, recent evidence suggests that machine learning models themselves may
drive health disparities through performance bias. Specifically, clinical decision-making models created in
majority populations may not perform as well in populations that were underrepresented during the creation of
the model (e.g., poorer likelihood of choosing the correct treatment if patients are rural). Given that virtually all
neuroimaging ‘brain-behavior’ predictive models in psychiatry research are generated from data collected in
highly populated metropolitan areas, this study will evaluate ‘brain-behavior’ models for performance bias in rural
populations. It will also investigate means of eliminating this bias that creates further health disparities in rural
populations. In Aim 1, I will use neuroimaging data from 9,811 individuals in the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive
Development Study to create a ‘brain-behavior’ predictive model of cognition. In Aim 2, I will evaluate this model
for urban-rural performance bias and pursue strategies to reduce model bias. This study will have important
implications for understanding how algorithms in healthcare drive health disparities and how we can reduce
these disparities by designing models that perform equitably within underrepresented populations."
10876927,"Project Abstract:
The size of a meal is carefully regulated to prevent over- or under-feeding. Direct control of meal size is
attributed by brainstem areas, such as the caudal nucleus of the solitary tract (cNTS), that directly receive
short-term sensory feedback from the GI tract during feeding. In contrast, the indirect controls, which include
hypothalamic circuits and leptin, are hypothesized to encode long-term energy balance and regulate meal
termination by modulating the potency of these short-term signals sensed in the brainstem. Interactions
between these long-term and short-term systems are critical for the control of food intake, but how it is
encoded in the dynamics of the underlying brainstem circuits remains unknown. The cNTS contains many cell
types that are involved in controlling food intake. Among these cell types, prolactin releasing hormone (PRLH)
and glucagon (GCG) neurons are particularly important for meal termination. In my recent studies, I performed
the first neural recordings of these two cell types in awake behaving mice. I found unexpectedly that these cells
were rapidly activated at the start of a meal by feedforward signals such as taste. These technical and
conceptual advances create an opportunity for me to investigate the longstanding question of how signals of
long-term energy balance modulate brainstem circuits to control meal termination. I propose here to address
this question by investigating how two regulators of long-term energy balance – Agouti-related peptide (AgRP)
neurons and leptin – modulate PRLH or GCG neuron dynamics or their control of feeding behavior. Together
these results will reveal how long-term systems modulate brainstem circuits to regulate meal size, which is an
important determinant of overall food intake and can be dysregulated in conditions like obesity."
10897245,"Parietal regions, including the posterior cingulate cortex, participate in brain networks critical for recollection,
order memory, autobiographical retrieval, and episodic simulation. The importance of regions such as the
posterior cingulate to episodic processing has been highlighted by data from animal models, non—invasive
imaging studies, brain stimulation experiments, and rare reports that use directly recorded brain activity in
humans. However, significant knowledge gaps remain related to the specific neurophysiological processes
that occur within the posterior cingulate and how this region integrates with hippocampal memory networks.
We propose three highly innovative experiments to address these knowledge gaps. First, we will obtain
microelectrode recordings from the posterior cingulate cortex during episodic encoding and retrieval. We will
identify time cells, a population of neurons that provide direct representation of temporal contextual
information. We will also identify episodic boundary cells, which represent a complementary population of
neurons critical for episodic construction. We will identify neuronal assemblies in the MTL and concomitant
ripple activity in the PCC. Second, we will use the novel experimental manipulation of administering the
anticholinergic agent scopolamine to human intracranial EEG subjects performing an episodic memory task
and record simultaneous hippocampal and parietal activity (from the posterior cingulate cortex). Based on our
preliminary data using this manipulation in this patient population, we predict that we will observe a decrease in
activity in the 2-5 Hz `slow theta’ frequency range, as well as commensurate changes in hippocampal—parietal
connectivity in the 5-9 Hz `fast theta’ frequency band. The use of scopolamine has direct relevance for
understanding cholinergic modulation in hippocampal memory circuits and implications for understanding how
degenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s Disease impact these circuits. Finally, we will use direct brain
stimulation applied to the posterior cingulate cortex and angular gyrus in the same experimental subjects to
understand how these regions may differentially modulate hippocampal theta oscillations, building on our
published work using this experimental approach. These experiments will take advantage of our unique
opportunity to obtain direct brain recordings from hippocampal networks in surgical epilepsy patients. Our
expertise in this area, demonstrated in our published findings from the previous funded period, supports our
ability to collect these proposed data and generative novel, high value datasets that will allow us to address the
knowledge gaps outlined above."

PIK3C2B encodes the class II PI3 kinase Phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 3-kinase C2 domain-containing beta
(PIK3C2B) protein, a regulator of vesicle trafficking through the endosome. Mouse knockout of Pik3c2b has no
overtly deleterious phenotype, but instead promotes a beneficial metabolic profile that includes reduced weight
gain, improved insulin sensitivity, and, most relevant for this proposal, reduced fat deposition in the liver. In
addition, we have previously shown that genetic reduction of Pik3c2b can both prevent and reverse the skeletal
muscle phenotype, as well as extend survival, of the mouse model of X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM).
XLMTM is rare neurogenetic condition with onset in infancy that is associated with profound muscle related
disabilities and early death. In addition to affecting the skeletal muscle, an emerging XLMTM phenotype is
hepatobiliary disease, which progresses to liver failure in a subset of patients. There are no treatments for
XLMTM. Importantly, liver disease has not previously been identified in pre-clinical models of XLMTM, a
significant barrier for disease understanding and treatment. To overcome this barrier, in new data, we have
developed the first mouse model of XLMTM liver disease.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a highly prevalent condition that affects nearly 25% of American
adults. It can lead to non-alcoholic hepatosteatosis (NASH), which in turn can progress to cirrhosis, liver failure,
liver cancer, and death. There are no adequate therapies for these common and severe conditions.
The scientific premise of this proposal is that reduction of PIK3C2B in mice promotes reduction of diet induced
fatty liver and amelioration of disease relevant XLMTM phenotypes. The overall goal of the project is to develop
therapies for XLMTM and NAFLD/NASH using a RNA knockdown based gene therapy.
We hypothesize the following: (1) PIK3C2B knockdown in muscle and liver can be specifically, lastingly, and
safely achieved with a synthetic miRNA delivered in vivo with AAV8 (AAV-miR-PIK3C2B); (2) AAV-miR-
PIK3C2B can ameliorate both muscle and liver and phenotypes of the XLMTM mouse model; and (3) AAV-miR-
PIK3C2B can prevent the development and progression of diet induce mouse NAFLD/NASH.
These hypotheses will be rigorously evaluated in 3 aims. Aim 1 will develop AAV-miR-PIK3C2B, Aim 2 will test
it in XLMTM mice, and Aim 3 will study it in a diet induced model of NASH. If successful, this proposal will be of
high significance and impact because it will identify a single therapy suitable for clinical translation for both a
rare, fatal paediatric condition and for a prevalent disease affecting millions of adults."
10994060,"ABSTRACT
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an extremely pervasive human herpesvirus, infecting approximately 95% of the global
population by adulthood. EBV is transmitted through saliva and establishes infection in the oral cavity where it
then establishes a latent infection for life in memory B cells. In most individuals this infection will remain benign,
but EBV-associated diseases include infectious mononucleosis and cancers, more commonly in immune-
compromised individuals. The balance between latent and lytic infection is under tight control and understanding
the regulation of this process has broad implications for processes ranging from viral persistence in the oral
mucosa to strategies to eliminate latently infected tumor cells. EBV reactivates in response to a diverse range of
stressors including DNA damage, hypoxia, histone deacetylase inhibitors and activation of the B-cell receptor. A
pervasive phenomenon, observed both in vitro and in vivo, is that cells have a heterogenous response to lytic
induction stimuli. In a fraction of cells, the virus fully reactivates, while others remain completely refractory or
only partially progress through the lytic cycle leading to an abortive infection. To better understand these cell
fates after EBV lytic reactivation, my lab recently completed a single-cell RNA seq experiment of resting and
reactivated EBV+ B lymphoma cells. We observed differential host gene expression patterns between refractory,
abortive, and productive lytic cells. This included high expression of the known EBV restriction factors MYC and
STAT3 in the refractory cells, but previously unknown markers of abortive cell populations: one characterized by
elevated IL-6 receptor and the other defined by pro-survival signaling through the NFB pathway. Based on our
single-cell data and prior studies, I hypothesize that an EBV induced DNA damage response leads to IL-6
production, which in turn promotes an abortive, antiviral state through the IL-6 receptor and ultimately pro-
survival NFB signaling. In addition to defining mechanisms of host defense from EBV reactivation, this work
also has important clinical ramifications as lytic induction therapies are currently in trials for EBV-associated
malignancies. Understanding host factors that restrict successful lytic reactivation could lead to more effective
therapeutic strategies in the future. Furthermore, these findings could have broad implications for how other
herpesviruses reactivate and how latently infected cells communicate to regulate this process."
10913355,"Project Summary/Abstract
The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is widely reported to play a role in visual attention, employed through modulation
of neuronal activity in visual processing regions, such as V4 and MT. Sub-regions within the PFC of monkeys,
such as the frontal eye fields (FEF) and the ventral prearcuate region (VPA), are reported to govern spatial and
feature-based attentional modulation of visual responses, respectively. However, the cellular-level circuitry and
neurocomputational mechanisms involved in the modulatory control of visual processing remain unclear.
Previous work suggests that interactions between diverse sub-populations in both FEF and VPA may facilitate
modulation of visual processing signals as well as shifts of attention, but this remains untested. The purpose
of my project is to determine the neuronal dynamics within sub-regions in PFC that govern top-
down modulation of visual processing. It is possible, that FEF may integrate signals representing object
identity which arise in VPA and transforms them to signals representing spatial locations of a target stimulus.
We plan on addressing this hypothesis by: (1) characterizing the spatial- and feature-tuning properties of FEF
in the context of visual search to understand how integration and transformation of attentional signals may be
implemented; (2) establishing the temporal dynamics between FEF and VPA to reveal the nature of neuronal
communication between both regions during visual search; and (3) determine the causal role of VPA towards
feature-based attentional modulation of visual processing via reversible pharmacologic inactivation. Monkeys
are trained on a visual search task designed to conditionally engage attentional processes that are dependent on
feature or spatial information. Using neurophysiology and population analyses, we will determine the neuronal
correlates of PFC which govern the computational processes needed to accomplish these tasks. These findings
will provide a description of the circuit-level mechanisms involved in top-down attention which often times is
affected in neuropsychological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, this project aims to contribute
knowledge concerning the neuronal correlates of visual processing that are involved in related underlying
symptoms. Additionally, learning about how higher-level brain regions modulate visual processing may provide
more information about how perception is conjured in the brain. My environment at UR fosters the opportunity
to broaden my research skillset which ultimately facilitates my endeavor towards my career goal as a scientific
leader pushing to improve our approach of intervening with mental illnesses. The social environment at UR
provides great opportunity for outreach, allowing me to fulfill my aspirations as a community leader looking to
pave a way for underrepresented individuals which get overlooked given their backgrounds."
11004608,"Project Summary
Cachexia is a devastating state of malnutrition brought about by a synergistic combination of decreased appetite
and increased metabolism of fat and lean mass. Furthermore, multiple organs, including the heart, are impaired
by this debilitating condition. While many chronic diseases such as heart failure, kidney failure, and cirrhosis are
associated with cachexia, this condition is particularly prevalent in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).
Our lab and others demonstrated significant structural and functional remodeling of the heart in various models
of cancer cachexia. These maladaptive changes in the heart are also observed in chemotherapy-naïve cancer
cachexia patients, limiting tolerable therapeutic options and quality of life. However, there are currently no
effective treatments for cachexia and the mediators of adverse cardiac remodeling in cancer-associated
cachexia remain elusive.
The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is responsible for the “fight-or-flight” response and primes the body to
fight disease. Chronic SNS overactivity is implicated in cachexia pathophysiology by browning white adipose
tissue and increasing basal metabolic rate. However, the role of the SNS in regulating cardiac remodeling during
cancer cachexia has not been investigated. Chronic elevation in SNS tone is a well-established driver of cardiac
pathology in patients with heart failure by direct stimulation of the heart. Elevated sympathetic tone to other
tissues, such as the bone marrow, also drives cardiovascular pathology by decreasing Cxcl12 expression in
bone marrow, resulting in augmented myelopoiesis and recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes to the
cardiovascular system. Using a model of PDAC-associated cachexia, I found a gene signature indicating adverse
structural remodeling and desensitization of adrenergic receptors in the heart. These observations are consistent
with direct SNS hyperactivity on the heart. Indeed, treatment with a non-selective adrenergic receptor blocker
was able to attenuate loss of cardiac tissue in animals with PDAC cachexia. Furthermore, I found increased
pool of neutrophils in the heart, which was accompanied by a downregulation of bone marrow Cxcl12 expression.
Therefore, based on my preliminary data and recent literature, I hypothesize that SNS hyperactivity mediates
adverse cardiac remodeling during cancer-cachexia. This project proposes to assess the effects of sympathetic
hyperactivity to the heart as well as bone marrow in driving cardiac remodeling during cachexia.
Collectively, this work has broad implications and is directly applicable to identifying new therapeutic targets for
treating cachexia and increasing survival in cancer patients. Achieving the goals of the proposal will: 1) enhance
our understanding of the root cause of cachexia induced cardiac remodeling, 2) provide novel therapeutic targets
for cachexia, and 3) describe novel mechanisms by which adrenergic signaling mediates cardiac stress that is
broadly applicable to several chronic diseases."

Obesity afflicts 42% of the adults in the United States and is associated with significant deleterious health effects.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represents a final pathway of acute lung injury (ALI) arising from
infectious, such as pneumonia, or sterile, such as ventilator induced lung injury, etiologies, and is associated
with high mortality. Obese patients are at increased risk of developing ARDS. This proposal addresses the critical
need to better understand the mechanisms that underlie the increased susceptibility of obese patients to ARDS.
We have shown in a murine model of high fat diet that obesity results in more severe ALI in sterile and infectious
models of ARDS. Obesity is characterized by increased fatty acid (FA) release that exceeds metabolic demands.
Although FA are important for the physiologic regulation of a number of processes, high levels are deleterious.
We have found increased free FA in the lung of obese mice after infectious and sterile ALI. FA are broken down
by means of oxidation for energy generation inside the mitochondria, whereas endogenous FA are
synthesized de novo from acetyl coenzyme A. High fat diet was associated with increased lung expression of
carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (CPT1a), an essential rate limiting enzyme for oxidation, and decreased
expression of fatty acid synthase (FASN), the enzyme catalyzing de novo FA synthesis, and of the mitochondrial
fusion protein mitofusin 2 (MFN2) after ALI. Mitochondria alter size and shape via fission and fusion to meet
cellular metabolic demands. Mitochondrial alterations in the alveolar epithelium have been implicated in ALI
pathogenesis. We demonstrated that depletion of FASN in alveolar epithelial type 2 cells was associated with
more severe ALI and impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics. In this proposal, we hypothesize high fat diet induced
downregulation of mitochondrial fusion and lipid synthesis lead to impaired mitochondrial metabolisml after injury.
Mitochondrial overload through excessive oxidation further exacerbates mitochondrial dysfunction. Aim 1 will
investigate the role of FA utilization in the pathogenesis of experimental obesity induced ALI by using genetic
and pharmacologic approaches to inhibit and enhance oxidation. Aim 2 will delineate the association between
FASN regulation, mitochondrial dynamics and alveolar epithelial cell type 2 dysfunction in ALI with high fat diet
using genetic approaches to inhibit FASN and MFN1/2 in a sterile and infectious model of ALI. Aim 3 will
characterize dysregulated metabolic pathways based on body mass index (BMI) in patients with ARDS using
plasma metabolomic profiling. These studies will provide insight into the interplay between obesity and ARDS
and may uncover an unappreciated role for lipid metabolism in ALI. This proposal plays a central role in a career
development plan for becoming a successful independent investigator focused on lung biology and lipid
metabolism. Weill Cornell Medicine is an ideal environment in which to execute this training plan not only
because of its excellent physical resources, but also because of its intellectual community of researchers with a
track record of strong mentorship of early stage investigators."
10749884,"CAR T cells can induce remarkable antitumor responses in patients with hematologic cancers but have been
largely ineffective in patients with solid tumors. Several barriers limit CAR T efficacy in solid malignancies
including the limited number of safe solid tumor-specific antigens and an immunosuppressive tumor
microenvironment (TME) that lacks supporting stimuli. Furthermore, it remains unknown how CAR T cells
influence the evolution of immune escape mechanisms in the human TME. We developed and tested a set of
chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that 1) target glypican-3 (GPC3), a tumor antigen selectively expressed by
several pediatric solid tumors but not non-malignant tissues, and 2) co-express interleukin-15 (IL15) and IL21,
cytokines that are important for T cell survival, expansion, persistence, and retention of antitumor effector
functionality. We found that T cells co-expressing a second generation GPC3-CAR and IL15 (15.GPC3-CAR)
have significantly improved expansion, persistence, and antitumor activity compared to GPC3-CAR T cells, and
that co-expression of both IL15 and IL21 (15.21.GPC3-CAR) further enhances these properties in preclinical
models. Additionally, our preclinical studies showed that 15.21.GPC3-CAR T cells uniquely maintain expression
of T cell factor-1, which protects CAR T cells from exhaustion and preserves proliferative capacity following
repeated GPC3-mediated activation. Since the safety and efficacy parameters of these cytokine-expressing CAR
T cells in humans are unknown, we propose to evaluate 15.GPC3-CAR and 15.21.GPC3-CAR T cells in
sequential phase 1 studies using Bayesian Optimal Interval dose escalation in children with relapsed or refractory
GPC3-positive solid tumors. Our multidisciplinary team has already generated promising safety and efficacy
results treating children with T cells expressing the GPC3-CAR alone. We hypothesize that 15.GPC3-CAR and
15.21.GPC3-CAR T cells will be safe and that co-expression of IL15 with IL21 will enable GPC3-CAR T cells to
overcome the inhibitory TME, resulting in robust expansion, persistence, and durable antitumor responses. In
Aim 1, we will evaluate the safety of 15.GPC3-CAR and 15.21.GPC3-CAR T cells in children with GPC3-positive
solid tumors. In Aim 2, we will determine the in vivo persistence and antitumor activity of CAR T cells. Finally, in
Aim 3, through the evaluation of CAR T cell products, peripheral blood samples, and post-infusion tumor
biopsies, we will define the transcriptomic and phenotypic profiles of GPC3-CAR T cells, cancer cells, and non-
neoplastic stromal cells. We will identify survival programs in CAR T cells and define immune escape
mechanisms in the TME using single-cell RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, and COdetection-by-inDEXing.
Through the proposed research, we will determine the safety, in vivo expansion and persistence, and antitumor
activity of our therapeutic cells. The results will identify survival programs in CAR T cells and immune escape
mechanisms in the human TME to provide a blueprint for developing effective measures that boost the efficacy
of CAR-based and other immunotherapies for patients with solid tumors."
10992594,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a prevalent form of pancreatic cancer, accounting for about 90%
of all cases of this disease. PDAC is highly fatal, where mortality closely parallels incidence, primarily due to the
inability to diagnose PDAC at early stages and resistance to all existing treatments. Besides genetic changes in
tumor cells, the tumor microenvironment plays a key role in tumor initiation, progression, and therapeutic
resistance. PDAC is notable for its dense desmoplastic stroma, consisting of extracellular matrix, cancer-
associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and immune cells. Another notable feature of the PDAC microenvironment is
hypoxia, a condition of insufficient oxygen availability. Although hypoxia leads to adaptive responses in both
cancer cells and stromal cells, the effects of hypoxia and hypoxia-inducible factor 1ɑ (HIF1ɑ), a master regulator
of hypoxic adaptation, on the PDAC stroma and tumor-stroma interactions are not fully understood. We have
recently found that inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs), a CAF subset producing high levels of inflammatory cytokines,
are linked to the hypoxia-related gene signature and the HIF1 signaling pathway in human and mouse PDAC.
By exposing 3D cocultures of pancreatic tumor cells and fibroblasts to either hypoxia or normoxia, we
demonstrated that hypoxia promotes iCAF formation via IL1ɑ secreted from tumor cells. Importantly, the
presence of hypoxic fibroblasts further elevated IL1ɑ levels in tumor cells, implicating hypoxia as a modulator of
bidirectional interactions between tumor cells and fibroblasts. Based on these data, I hypothesize that hypoxia
promotes iCAF formation by modulating bidirectional interactions between tumor cells and fibroblasts in PDAC.
In Specific Aim 1, I will determine how hypoxia induces IL1ɑ expression in tumor cells via fibroblasts by using a
three-dimensional (3D) coculture system of pancreatic tumor cells and fibroblasts and exposing the coculture to
either hypoxia or normoxia. In Specific Aim 2, I will determine whether and how fibroblast HIF1ɑ regulates tumor
cell-fibroblast interactions and pancreatic tumorigenesis by using 3D cocultures of tumor cells and fibroblasts
deficient of HIF1ɑ, and using mouse models lacking fibroblast expression of HIF1ɑ. My work will identify the
molecular mechanisms underlying hypoxic regulation of cancer cell-CAF crosstalk. In addition, my studies will
determine how activation of HIF1ɑ within CAFs regulates the tumor stroma and PDAC progression, which will
inform targeting fibroblast HIF1ɑ as a potential therapeutic avenue to treat PDAC patients."
10928123,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Many clinically relevant pathogens have bacteriophage (phage) genomes integrated in their chromosome
(prophages), which can have large effects on the bacteria’s phenotype and fitness. Since phage fitness is tied
to bacterial host fitness, phages can become fitter by decreasing their burden on their host. However, when
bacteria are infected by multiple phages (i.e., superinfection), competition for host resources may select phages
that are more competitive against other phages, even at the increased burden to their host. The objective of this
proposal is to understand and learn to exploit the evolutionary tradeoff between phage intracellular
competitiveness and bacterial fitness during superinfection. Understanding this tradeoff will give better insight
into how prophages influence their bacterial host’s phenotype and fitness, and potentially pave way for a novel
approach in phage therapy that utilizes such tradeoffs to make bacterial infections easier to treat.
 We propose to use Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) and its prophage, Pf phage, as a model system for better
understanding the evolutionary tradeoff between phage competitiveness and bacterial fitness. More than half of
Pa carry Pf prophages. Furthermore, cystic fibrosis (CF) patients who are chronically infected with Pa were more
likely to have Pa that have Pf prophages than acutely infected patients. This hints that Pf phages are an integral
part of Pa evolutionary history and pathogenesis. The first part of this project aims to understand whether Pa
virulence factor production is correlated with the number of Pf prophages that Pa carries in its chromosome.
From a previously funded study, we have a collection of >100 Pa clinical isolates from 33 CF patients that carry
zero, one, or two Pf prophages. Using this collection and lab Pa strains, we will test for correlations between Pf
copy number and the production of virulence factors like pyocyanin and pyoverdine. In the second aim, we will
superinfect Pa lab strain PA14 with Pf phage that has a mutation in the prophage repressor gene. This Pf phage
mutant replicates quickly and at high populations within the host cell, creating an environment that favors
selection for defective interfering (DI) phages that lack capsid genes. These DI phages are cheaters that exploit
full-length phages for public resources, like capsid, to selfishly propagate. Pf capsid is tied to clinically relevant
phenotypes of Pa, such as biofilm robustness and antibiotic tolerance. Thus, the loss of capsid genes is not only
a way Pf phages become more competitive against other Pf phages but can affect host fitness as well. We plan
to evolve PA14 infected with this selfish Pf phage under biofilm and antibiotic selection to test whether capsid
genes become lost over time, undermining biofilm stability and antibiotic tolerance.
 Completion of this project will provide valuable information on the influence prophages have on their bacterial
host’s phenotype and fitness. Exploiting the evolutionary tradeoff between phage competitiveness and host
fitness may potentially pave way for a novel approach in phage therapy, analogous to a gene drive, that exploits
such tradeoffs to make bacterial infections easier to treat."

Biological sex impacts the immune system, as evidenced by differences between men and women in vaccine-
induced humoral responses. There is a considerable gap in knowledge, however, surrounding the
immunological responsiveness of transgender people, a population at considerably higher risk for HIV and
other STIs. To address this gap, we propose to develop an animal model of feminizing hormone therapy to
study the effects of estrogen/anti-testosterone therapy on HIV vaccine-induced immune responses.
Cross-sex hormone therapy (XHT) is the most common approach for transition-related care, but immunological
studies of transgender individuals are generally limited to case studies. Animal models of gonadectomy and/or
supranormal hormone treatment have implicated sex hormones as potent modulators of the immune system,
with estrogens generally appearing to enhance immune responses and testosterone inhibiting them. However,
ambiguous (and sometimes paradoxical) observations have obscured an overarching consensus for sex
hormone effects on immunity. In recent years, mouse models of XHT have provided important insights into
effects of prolonged hormone therapy on bone physiology, reproductive function etc., but information on the
effects of sex hormone therapy on immune responsiveness is scarce.
 For this project, we will develop a mouse model of XHT that recapitulates clinical hormone therapy for
male-to-female transition in humans. We hypothesize that mice and humans share sets of immune-related
genes that are impacted by a feminizing hormone regimen, and that mice undergoing XHT will exhibit altered
immune responses to a HIV vaccine compared to control male mice. To test these hypotheses, we will define
the relevance of this mouse model to human transition-related care through a single-cell transcriptomics
approach to define differentially expressed genes in control and XHT mice, and then compare these cell-type
specific sets of differentially expressed genes to those obtained from the same analyses of people undergoing
feminizing hormone therapy (pre and two years post-initiation of hormone therapy) (Specific Aim 1). To test the
effects of hormone therapy on in vivo vaccine responses, we will immunize control male mice and XHT mice
with a HIV vaccine regimen that is highly sensitive to sex-dependent factors (Specific Aim 2).
 Should this study reveal an immunoregulatory effect of feminizing hormone therapy on HIV vaccine
responsiveness in mice, it will provide a new platform for assessing the effects of sex hormones on vaccine
responses. Moreover, this animal model could then be used to test various vaccination parameters (adjuvant,
dose, interval, etc.) for sex hormone-dependent effects, with the ultimate goal of designing an HIV vaccine that
maximizes efficacy but minimizes adverse outcomes."

The inflammasomes are cytoplasmic multi-protein complexes that can sense and be activated by microbes or
tissue damage, which then leads to the activation of caspase-mediated inflammatory pathways involving the
release of cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. Although the pro-inflammatory role of inflammasomes have been well
established in innate immune cells, recently, several studies have uncovered a role for different inflammasome
components in regulating many different T cell responses, a key part of adaptive immunity. Specifically, a
subset of T cells called regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are known for their ability to suppress immune
responses and inflammation, were shown to be affected by their cell intrinsic inflammasome components. Even
though the critical role of Tregs in establishing tolerance to a wide range of innocuous foreign antigens from
commensal microbes and food in the gut has long been well-recognized, the function of the NLRP3
inflammasome in Treg-mediated control of intestinal homeostasis remains an open question. Based on
preliminary data, it was hypothesized that NLRP3/inflammasome could serve as an integral determinant in
controlling Treg biology and that induction of NLRP3 in intestinal Tregs would be specifically required for their
control of Th17 responses in the intestine. To test this hypothesis, the first aim will elucidate the function of
NLRP3 in controlling Treg biology in the gut in heath and disease using both loss-of-function and gain-of-
function approaches through employing two novel mouse models that have been recently generated in the lab:
mice with Treg-specific deletion of NLPR3 and mice with Treg-specific expression of constitutively active
NLRP3. Two different Th17-dependent disease models: anti-CD3 induced intestinal inflammation and
Citrobacter rodentium infection model will be employed. As such, the biological impact of NLRP3 depletion or
constitutive activation in Tregs on the other immune cells in the intestinal system under both physiological and
pathological conditions will be elucidated. In the second aim, the molecular mechanisms underlying NLRP3-
mediated control of Treg biology will be investigated. First, as IL-1b, a component of the NLRP3/inflammasome
pathway was also found to be selectively induced in intestinal Tregs under inflammation, I will determine the
potential role of Treg-derived IL-1b in controlling intestinal homeostasis. Next, the potential involvement of
inflammasome-independent vs. –dependent mechanism underlying NLRP3-mediated Treg biology will also be
examined. Finally, as the heterogeneous nature of Tregs is now well appreciated, Cellular Indexing of
Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-seq) studies will be conducted to determine if there is a
specific subset of Tregs that expresses NLRP3 or whether NLRP3 induction is a common feature for all
intestinal Tregs under inflammation. Collectively, this study will provide mechanistic insights into the
underappreciated anti-inflammatory role of NLRP3 in intestinal Tregs and will undoubtedly facilitate the
development of future therapeutics for inflammatory bowel disease and other human intestinal disorders."
10750969,"Coronary heart disease remains the leading cause of deaths in the US. Despite the success of lipid lowering,
residual risk remains. Recent clinical studies support the role of inflammation in CVD, a longstanding topic of
basic research. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) are innate lymphocytes that play essential role in obesity
by promoting adipocyte beiging and recruiting beige cells to the white adipose tissue, thereby limiting obesity
development. Limited information is available regarding ILC2 function in CVD, although transplantation of
bone-marrow from ILC2-deficient mice promoted atherogenesis. Eosinophils (EOS) accumulate in blood or at
the site of inflammation after allergic sensitization or parasite infection. Blood EOS count and EOS cationic
protein (ECP) levels associate positively with major CV risk factors and CVD prevalence and mortality. Yet
other studies reported reduced blood EOS count and ECP levels in patients with major adverse cardiac events
and heart failure. Therefore, the role of ILC2 and EOS in human CVD remains unsettled. Our preliminary
studies demonstrated ILC2 accumulation in mouse heart after myocardial infarction (MI). ILC2 deficiency
(ILC2KO) or diphtheria toxin A (DTA)-induced ILC2 depletion (ILC2DTA) exacerbated cardiac dysfunction,
myocardial cell death and fibrosis post-MI. Further study showed that ILC2 deficiency blunted blood IL5, an
essential type-2 cytokine from ILC2 that controls the expansion and migration of EOS, dendritic cells (DC), and
regulatory T cells (Treg) to the bloodstream or the site of inflammation. FACS analysis revealed deficiency of
splenic, blood, or heart EOS and DC in ILC2KO mice post-MI. Administration of mouse recombinant IL5
reversed EOS loss in blood, providing a mechanistic explanation of ILC2 activity in alleviating cardiac
dysfunction post-MI and suggesting a concurrent cardioprotective role of EOS and ILC2 in post-MI heart.
Consistent with this hypothesis, exacerbated post-MI cardiac dysfunctions in ILC2KO mice got improved after
mice receiving adoptive transfer of ILC2 or EOS from wild-type (WT) mice, but not ILC2 from IL5-/- mice. We
recently reported high blood EOS count in patients with acute MI and EOS accumulation in mouse heart post-
MI. EOS-deficient ∆dblGATA mice (EOSKO) demonstrated exacerbated cardiac dysfunction and myocardial
fibrosis, all which can be corrected by repopulation of donor EOS from WT mice or by giving mice recombinant
murine EOS cationic protein mEar1 (human ECP ortholog). Similar to the EOSKO mice, DTA-induced depletion
of EOS in iPHIL mice (EOSDTA) also worsened the cardiac function post-MI. Based on these observations, we
hypothesize that ILC2 protect heart from post-MI cardiac dysfunction. One mechanism is to release type-2
cytokines, such as IL5 to promote the development and migration of bone-marrow EOS to the bloodstream and
heart where EOS exert a similar reparative role to that of ILC2 in mitigating ischemic cardiac injury. We
propose two Aims to examine whether and how ILC2 protect heart from MI-induced cardiac dysfunction and to
explore the EOS-mediated reparative mechanisms in response to myocardial ischemic injury."

During different behavioral states, such as quiescence versus vigilance, neural circuits are set into distinct operating modes and respond to afferent inputs, such as sensory stimulation, in very different ways. In other words, neural circuits are rapidly configured into appropriate information processing modes demanded by behavioral states. The first question this project addresses is, what are the operating modes of sensorimotor circuits during different behavioral states and how are they set? During exploratory behaviors, animals move their body (head, limbs, and trunk) and adjust the position of the sensors (eyes, fingers, pinnae, whiskers) used to explore the environment. During these states, the brain must disambiguate the neural activity that causes the movements from the activity that is driven by the movement and its interaction with the environment. The second question this project addresses is, how does the brain differentiate motor from sensory activities during active exploration of the environment? As animals explore the environment, detection of an unexpected stimulus leads to an orienting response by which animals move to evaluate the stimulus. Repeated presentation of the stimulus without significant consequences leads to habitation of the orienting response, and the stimulus is eventually ignored. The third question this project addresses is, what neural circuits drive orienting responses and how does habituation occur at a neural level? These questions will be investigated using a combination of methods that include electrophysiology, optogenetics, DREADDs, pharmacology, and histology applied using a variety of approaches ranging from acute slices of brain tissue to freely behaving rodents conducting behavioral tasks. We will take advantage of readily available Cre driver lines that allow to control the activity of specific neuronal populations and test their role in behavior. The neural and behavioral processes we study are normal, but when they go awry they lead to neurological disorders. Deciphering the normal operating modes of neural circuits is essential to understand how these operations are impacted by neurological disorders."

There is a fundamental gap in understanding the pathophysiology of isolated adult-onset dystonia due to
genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity. Determining common pathophysiologic mechanisms across dystonia
subtypes is a critical step toward developing more generalizable and effective therapies. Emerging evidence
points to striatal cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) playing a key role in the pathophysiology of dystonia, including
biochemical and network-level dysfunction. In addition to offering a common therapeutic target, our findings
are likely to benefit gene discovery and research on other disabling, less common forms of dystonia. Over the
long term, results could guide researchers to perform greater in depth histopathological and biochemical studies
in the brain that can lead to identification of new targets for therapeutic intervention. Our goal is to apply a
recently developed PET radioligand, [18F]VAT, which possesses high selectivity for vesicular acetylcholine
transporters, to investigate striatal ChIs. Structural and resting state functional MRI will examine the
relationship of striatal ChIs to related brain networks across different focal dystonia subtypes. Identification of
network-level changes across dystonia subtypes will provide better understanding of common pathophysiology
and could potentially provide means to assess target engagement for future therapeutic interventions. The
central hypothesis is that striatal ChIs contribute to a common pathophysiological mechanism in humans with
isolated adult-onset focal dystonia, and that cholinergic integrity relates to striatal functional connectivity and
clinical features of dystonia. The rationale for the proposed research is the likely involvement of striatal ChIs in
a) normal motor control and b) animal models of dystonia. ChIs are autonomously active and mediate a baseline
presynaptic inhibitory tone on striatal medium spiny neurons against the excitatory cortical drive, likely via
modulation of dopamine release via presynaptic cholinergic receptors on nigrostriatal dopaminergic terminals.
They also receive input from intralaminar thalamic neurons innervated by cerebellar afferents, that when
dysfunctional may contribute to dystonic phenotypes. Thus, ChIs may contribute to a common pathogenic
mechanism involving cortico-striata-thalamic or cerebello-thalamo-striatal networks. This hypothesis will be
tested by pursuing three specific aims: Determine if 1) dysfunction of striatal ChIs is a common
mechanism across isolated dystonia subtypes; 2) common aberrations in functional striatal
brain networks underlie the isolated dystonia subtypes; 3) clinical characteristics relate to
markers of ChIs and brain network dysfunction across different isolated adult-onset focal
dystonias. This approach is innovative as it uses comprehensive multimodal imaging to investigate novel PET-
measured cholinergic integrity and related functional networks. The proposed research is significant because it
is expected to critically advance the understanding of dystonia. Ultimately, such knowledge may provide critical
rationale to identify and test new therapeutic targets and better understand other disabling forms of dystonia."

Severe abdominal pain is a cardinal symptom of pancreatitis, present in up to 90% of patients with recurrent
acute pancreatitis (RAP) and chronic pancreatitis (CP). As pain increases in severity and constancy, it is
associated with significant morbidity including depression and anxiety symptoms, low physical functioning,
sleep disturbance, and low quality of life, as well as high economic and societal burden. Painful RAP and CP is
most often managed with chronic opioids, which unfortunately have limited efficacy and substantial risk for
adverse side effects. This application focuses on addressing this treatment gap in pain management with a
well-established nonpharmacologic intervention. Our team has established efficacy of an internet-delivered
cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention for chronic pain, and recently adapted it for pancreatitis pain
(the Pancreatitis Pain Course), showing promise for reducing pain and disability in this population. We propose
a hybrid effectiveness-implementation design type 1 trial to make rapid translational gains with the primary goal
of gathering data on CBT treatment effects on pancreatitis pain and pain interference in individuals with RAP
and CP with a secondary goal of gathering implementation data to inform dissemination of the Pancreatitis
Pain Course to real-world settings. Our central hypothesis is that the Pancreatitis Pain Course will be effective
in reducing pain interference and severity in individuals with painful RAP and CP. Our specific aims are to 1)
Determine the effectiveness of the Pancreatitis Pain Course in improving pancreatitis pain outcomes, 2)
(Exploratory) Explore the moderating effects of social determinants of health with changes in pain interference
and severity following treatment, and 3) Identify implementation facilitators, challenges, and solutions for
structures and processes that contribute to the seamless integration of the Pancreatitis Pain Course into
clinical centers and the community. This study will leverage resources of the Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes,
and Pancreatic Cancer (CPDPC) Consortium, a NIDDK-sponsored U01 consortium with recruitment from their
nine clinical centers and from self-referral in the community through partnership with the National Pancreas
Foundation. Using a multicenter randomized-controlled pragmatic clinical trial, we will enroll 280 individuals
with painful CP into the clinical trial and randomize them to CBT, providing access to the Pancreatitis Pain
Course to learn pain self-management skills (e.g., relaxation, activity pacing, goal setting) or education control
(access to education website about RAP and CP pain). We will collect patient-reported outcomes at baseline,
two months, and six-month follow-up. Relevant stakeholder groups (patients, providers, organizational
managers) will participate in a process evaluation to inform future implementation in clinic and community
settings. The proposed investigation will significantly advance solutions for nonopioid pain management in CP.
If successful, our project will minimize disparities in care, and address a critical need for low-cost, accessible
pain self-management for individuals with painful CP."

The circadian clock confers temporal control to metabolic pathways, and its disruption leads to insulin resistance
and obesity. Skeletal muscle plays a critical role in nutrient metabolism and protein homeostasis. We and others
demonstrated that the muscle-intrinsic clock regulates skeletal muscle development, growth, and metabolism.
Despite the extensive studies of circadian regulation in glucose and lipid metabolism, there is a current
knowledge gap regarding clock function in protein metabolism that determines muscle mass. In addition,
although circadian misalignment is prevalent in a modern lifestyle, potential circadian etiologies underlying
muscle wasting and impaired metabolic capacity remains unknown. We have identified a novel clock-driven
temporal control of PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 signaling in skeletal muscle that is independent of feeding-induced
activation. Surprisingly, clock disruption mimicking shiftwork resulted in progressive muscle atrophy
accompanied with impaired PI3K-Akt signaling and elevated protein turnover. Furthermore, mechanistic studies
revealed circadian clock transcriptional control of the Insulin/Igf-1-PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling cascade. These
findings, together with prior research support a hypothesis that that the muscle-intrinsic clock confers temporal
control in PI3K-Akt-mTOR cascade to drive protein metabolism and insulin sensitivity, and this mechanism
underlies circadian disruption-induced muscle atrophy and insulin resistance. The overarching goal of this project
is to comprehensively define this newly discovered clock-PI3K-Akt-mTOR regulatory axis in muscle nutrient
homeostasis and muscle mass regulation. Specifically, we will leverage our unique clock modulation models with
multi-omics approaches to comprehensively define the molecular mechanisms responsible for and the
physiological significance of the clock-Akt-mTOR regulatory axis in protein metabolism, insulin sensitivity and
muscle mass maintenance. More importantly, we propose to test genetic and pharmacological clock-augmenting
interventions to counteract muscle anabolic and metabolic deficits induced by clock disruption. The outcome of
this proposal may uncover a circadian etiology underlying impaired metabolic capacity in sarcopenia and provide
the mechanistic basis for clock-targeting interventions."

Tendon hierarchical structure dictates its ability to effectively transmit loads from muscle to bone. Formation of
tendon during tendon development and healing is reliant on coordination of multiscale regulatory governing
processes such as formation of fibrils from collagen molecules, assembly of fibril bundles to form fibers, and
recruitment of fibers to form fascicles. Collagen XII is a Fibril-Associated Collagen with Interrupted Triple
Helices (FACIT) and is primarily expressed during tendon growth and development and following injury.
Collagen XII interacts with collagen I fibrils and cell surfaces and its localization to form flexible bridges
between collagen fibrils implicates its role in regulating collagen I fibrillogenesis, fibril organization, and
interactions with other extracellular matrix constituents. Further, collagen XII has critical roles in the injury and
regenerative responses. For instance, collagen XII co-localization with collagen I and other matrix components
is present during tissue regeneration, suggesting a role in tissue cohesion. Recent data showed that collagen
XII deficiency disrupts tendon structural and functional properties in mice and human disease, suggesting that
collagen XII regulation is critical in tendon development and healing. However, the mechanisms by which
collagen XII deficiency disrupts formation of tendon hierarchical structure during postnatal development, and
recapitulation of this hierarchical structure after injury, remain unknown. Therefore, the objective of this
proposal is to establish the mechanisms involving collagen XII regulation of tendon hierarchical structure,
mechanical function and composition throughout postnatal development and healing. We hypothesize that
collagen XII-mediated mechanisms are required for establishing tendon structure and function and that these
regulatory mechanisms are recapitulated after injury. To test this, we will use our novel tendon-targeted
Col12a1 knockout and inducible Col12a1 knockdown mouse models for investigation of the regulatory roles of
collagen XII throughout Achilles tendon development and healing. We will perform comprehensive multiscale
structural, functional, and compositional assays using our innovative mouse models in the following: Aim 1:
Elucidate the mechanistic roles of collagen XII in regulating hierarchical assembly of tendon required for
function during postnatal development. Aim 2: Define the regulatory mechanisms involving collagen XII during
healing. Utilizing our innovative mouse models, we will define tendon-specific regulatory mechanisms involving
collagen XII to provide a fundamental understanding of the acquisition of tendon structure and function and its
re-establishment during healing. Comprehensive, and rigorous assessments of tendon multiscale structure,
function, and composition will define the role of collagen XII throughout the progressive stages of postnatal
development and the post-injury healing response. Activities described by this proposal provide a strong
foundation for scientific inquiry, preparing me to make valuable contributions as an independent investigator."
10928726,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Proprioception is an indispensable sense of the body’s position and movement in space. Fine motor control
depends on proprioceptors to monitor the mechanical consequences of motor actions. In particular, muscle
spindles are a class of primary proprioceptors that detect muscle length and stretch at the intrafusal fibers. The
signals generated by muscle spindles are complex with dynamical regulation of intrafusal fiber lengths via γ
motor neuron (fusimotor) activity. The interaction between feedforward mechanical signals at the muscle spindle
and descending motor commands at the parent muscle, especially in the context of naturalistic movements,
remains poorly understood. Opposing views disagree on whether muscle spindles passively sense muscle
length/stretch or actively process biomechanical signals based on motor commands to the muscle. Using the
unique advantages of rodent jaw proprioceptors in the hindbrain mesencephalic trigeminal (MeV) nucleus, I will
test the hypothesis that motor commands flexibly tune jaw muscle spindle coding in a context-dependent manner.
With experimental access to many levels of the jaw sensorimotor circuit, I will determine how feedforward
mechanical signals and descending motor commands interact at the primary proprioceptors. Aim 1 will find the
relationship between motor unit activity in jaw muscles and corresponding muscle spindle activity during passive
and active movements. Aim 2 will record muscle spindle activity with (a) external loads on the jaw and (b)
optogenetic decoupling of motor drives from muscle-driven motion. Aim 3 will provide an overarching framework
to model the jaw system as a feedback control loop. The proposed project investigates proprioceptive feedback
in craniofacial structures, electrophysiological mechanisms for controlling jaw function, and quantitative models
of the neural controller and muscles of the jaw. The immense training potential in this project lies in the application
of novel in vivo electrophysiology tools, well-designed use of optogenetics, and quantitative modeling rooted in
control theory. The proposed work has important implications in elucidating orofacial proprioception at the
primary receptors and understanding temporomandibular disorders and orofacial pain involving maladaptive
control of the jaw."
10948910,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Skeletal muscle insulin resistance with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is, in part, caused by adipose inflammation and
endocrine signaling. Intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) is a particularly problematic adipose depot as it resides
under the muscle fascia and between myofiber bundles. Thus, it is uniquely situated for paracrine-mediated
signaling towards muscle. Total IMAT content and its pro-inflammatory transcriptome relate to insulin resistance
in humans, with the obese IMAT secretome milieu inhibiting myotube insulin sensitivity in vitro. However, it is
unknown if the pro-inflammatory IMAT secretome is dynamic, contributing to muscle insulin resistance with
obesity and T2D. There is a critical need to address this gap in knowledge in order to provide the framework for
interventions to minimize IMAT-induced muscle metabolic dysfunction. The overall objective of this project is to
quantify the IMAT secretome across BMI and insulin sensitivity and evaluate the importance of mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in IMAT-induced muscle insulin resistance. We will utilize IMAT from the vastus
lateralis of individuals with obesity or obesity and prediabetes/T2D in comparison to lean controls through a
currently funded R01 (under the sponsor Dr. Bryan Bergman) to achieve the following specific aims. Aim I:
Evaluate the extent to which intermuscular adipose tissue pro-inflammatory secretion differs across BMI
and insulin sensitivity in humans. Based on our preliminary evidence that IMAT with obesity has a more potent
pro-inflammatory secretome compared to other adipose depots, our hypothesis is that IMAT secretome scales
to BMI and insulin resistance. A high-throughput quantitative proteomic assay will measure inflammatory proteins
in IMAT conditioned media. Aim II: Elucidate the importance of MAPK signaling in intermuscular adipose
tissue-induced skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Our preliminary evidence demonstrates that obese IMAT
paracrine milieu upregulates c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK1) and p38 activity, and downregulates insulin
sensitivity, in human myotubes. Our hypothesis is that inhibition of MAPK signaling will help to alleviate IMAT-
induced muscle insulin resistance. This will be tested by evaluating IMAT conditioned media-induced insulin
resistance with either JNK1 or p38 inhibition through either viral siRNA knockdown or pharmacological inhibition
in human myotubes. Our expected contribution is significant because IMAT is positioned as a strong candidate
to explain the pathology of muscle insulin resistance that is central to T2D. This training plan includes
sponsorship by Dr. Bergman at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus (CUAMC). The proposed
research will enhance the skillset of the postdoctoral fellow in both clinical and in vitro methods. The postdoctoral
fellow will complete additional training in endocrinology, obesity metabolism, and biostatistics through the
Nutrition Obesity Research Center and Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute at CUAMC. This research,
sponsor, and institution will collectively position me as an independent translational scientist investigating the
role of skeletal muscle insulin resistance in T2D risk and progression."

Communication between cells in the brain occurs predominantly via chemical secretion in neuronal
specializations called presynaptic terminals where synaptic vesicles (SVs) fuse with the plasma membrane to
release neurotransmitter molecules. These membrane fusion events are tightly controlled and modulated by key
synaptic proteins such as the neuronal SNARE proteins as well as Munc13-1/UNC-13, Munc18-1/UNC-18,
Complexin, and Synaptotagmin. Munc13-1 is major hub for every step in synaptic transmission. Moreover,
mutations in the human UNC-13 ortholog are associated with severe neurological and developmental disorders.
Importantly, the mechanisms underlying the various Munc13-1 functions are largely unknown. We recently
characterized a novel domain at the C-terminus of Munc13-1 termed HC2M that plays a role in SV
docking/priming, and mutations in this domain have a devastating impact on synaptic transmission and nervous
system function in the model organism C. elegans. Using a combination of genetic, behavioral, imaging, and
biochemical methods, we will investigate the role of UNC-13 in driving the assembly of the neuronal SNAREs, a
critical first step in SV priming. This project will shed light on some of the enduring mechanistic mysteries
underlying synaptic transmission."

Glioblastoma (GBM) is an incurable primary brain tumor that is characterized by regions of
hypoxia and marked resistance to radiation. Glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) are a highly malignant
subpopulation of cells that are highly resistant to standard cytotoxic treatments. GSCs have a
high capacity for self-renewal and are frequently located in hypoxic areas, making them more
even difficult to kill with radiation. GSCs therefore play an important role in disease recurrence.
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently been found to be dysregulated in cancer.
LncRNAs have multiple functions including regulation of gene expression. We have found that
the lncRNA Lucat1 is an important regulator of GSC response to hypoxia. Lucat1 is frequently
overexpressed in GBM and is associated with poor prognosis in the aggressive IDH wt subtype.
Our data support that Lucat1 is induced by hypoxia and forms a positive regulatory loop to
promote HIF1a signaling. Functionally, our data support that Lucat1 helps to maintain GSCs in
hypoxia and promote tumor growth. In this study, we propose to determine a mechanism by which
Lucat1 regulates HIF1 signaling (Aim 1) and assess the function of Lucat1 in GSC maintenance
and tumor progression (Aim 2). These studies will reveal a new and important mechanism by
which hypoxic induction of Lucat1 drives GSC-mediated tumorigenesis. If successful, our findings
will provide a new therapeutic approach for targeting GSCs in hypoxia to improve GBM control.
This treatment strategy may be extended to other cancers including smoking-associated lung
cancer and renal cell cancer that express high levels of Lucat1."

This application investigates mechanisms of gene and environment interaction in carcinogenesis.
Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is frequent in individuals continuously exposed to carcinogenic mineral
fibers such as asbestos and erionite, but it is very rare in those with limited or no exposure. Genetics
influences susceptibility to MM. We have recently demonstrated that carriers of germline BAP1 mutations
have increased incidence of multiple cancer types, including MM (we named this condition the “BAP1
cancer syndrome”). In some BAP1-mutation carrying families, MM accounts for more than 50% of
deaths, and we found that this may be due to increased susceptibility to MM from exposure to modest
amounts of asbestos that would normally not cause MM in the general population. We also found that
heterozygous BAP1 germline mutations in addition to asbestos, also increase susceptibility to malignant
transformation following exposure to Ionizing Irradiation and ultraviolet (UV) light –which may account for
the high prevalence of melanomas and skin carcinomas in carriers of BAP1 mutations. BAP1 is the first and
so far the only gene shown to regulate environmental carcinogenesis. The mechanism(s) by which
mutated BAP1 causes MM pathogenesis are being elucidated. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) binds and
activates the IP3 receptors (IP3Rs). We demonstrated that BAP1 is present in the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) where it regulates the activity of the IP3-Receptor-3 (IP3R3), the main ER channel that controls Ca2+
release from the ER to the cytoplasm to the mitochondria, regulating apoptosis. We discovered that reduced
levels of BAP1 in carriers of heterozygous BAP1 mutations impair apoptosis and favor cellular transformation
of cells that accumulated DNA damage following exposure to asbestos, IR and UV-light. We also discovered
that “normal” primary cells of carriers of heterozygous germline BAP1 mutations derive energy from aerobic
glycolysis, known as Warburg effect, which so far had been considered a hallmark of cancer cells. We
identified a specific metabolic signature associated with the Warburg effect by studying the metabolites present
in the plasma of carriers of heterozygous germline BAP1 mutations. Our central hypothesis is that changes in
Ca2+ concentration lead to increased resistance of cells containing BAP1 mutations to apoptosis and to
changes in metabolic pathways that in turn are responsible for the very high cancer penetrance observed in
BAP1 mutation carriers. To address this hypothesis we will examine the following specific Aims:
AIM 1: To study the mechanisms by which BAP1 mutations induce a “Warburg effect”.
AIM 2: To study the hypothesis that the Warburg effect is HIF-1α-independent in BAP1+/- cells.
AIM 3: To study the contributions of calcium signaling and metabolic alterations due to germline BAP1
mutations to MM development.
To elucidate the activity of BAP1 on the I P 3 R 3 and the related effects on cancer penetrance, we have
assembled a unique cohort of families carrying germline BAP1 mutations and have access to unique
reagents derived from volunteers from these families. These unique reagents include: primary cell cultures
derived from family members that inherited germline BAP1 mutations as well as from sex- and age-
matched controls from the same families, sera and plasma from germline BAP1 mutation carriers and
matched controls, and a heterozygous BAP1 mouse model and derived cell cultures. In addition, we
assembled a unique sets of heterozygous BAP1 and IP3R3 mice that recapitulate the human condition
and that allow us to study the effects of BAP1 mutations in vivo upon exposure to carcinogens.
Collaborations with some of the leading experts in the field, Drs. Pinton and Giorgi, experts in Ca2+
signaling and mitochondrial metabolism; and Dr. Mikoshiba, expert in IP3R3 activities, complement and
synergize with the expertise of the two MPIs. These studies will be relevant to the multiple malignancies
associated with the BAP1 cancer syndrome, in both carriers of BAP1 mutations and those who develop
somatic mutations of BAP1 during tumor development."

Among all racial groups, African American men have the highest rate of prostate cancer, and their cancers exhibit
a more aggressive biology, leading to higher rates of death. Although systemic treatments have been developed
for this disease, these are primarily palliative; additional treatment strategies need to be developed. The major
objective of this proposed project is to develop new targeted therapeutics to improve treatment of patients with
advanced prostate cancer, including African American patients who have a particularly worse prognosis and
whose tumors harbor more of an inflammatory and immune signature. CD24, a cell-surface glycoprotein, is not
expressed in normal prostate epithelial cells but is expressed in approximately 50% of prostate cancers and in
60-66% of African American prostate cancers. For humans and mice, CD24 expression is associated with
prostate cancer metastasis, and for patients with prostate cancer, over-expression of CD24 is associated with
tumor metastasis and poor prognosis. Notably, a CD24-p53 axis contributes to African American prostate cancer
disparities. In addition, CD24 is the dominant innate immune checkpoint in human cancers and is a promising
target for cancer immunotherapy. Thus, CD24 may have dual functions as a cell-intrinsic oncogene and an
immune suppressor, and it is a potential therapeutic target for patients with metastatic, castration-resistant
prostate cancers. We hypothesize that targeting the CD24-p53 axis is an effective therapy for African Americans
with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. In this application, we propose a) to synthesize and
characterize multifunctional nanoparticles for targeted delivery of anti-CD24 antibody and PRIMA1 (a p53
inducer), b) to evaluate targeted delivery of CD24/p53 targeted multimodal therapy to reduce prostate cancer
racial disparities, and c) to determine the molecular mechanisms of the targeted therapy. Our proposed work is
expected to establish CD24 as a new therapeutic target and to demonstrate a new therapy that meets the needs
of African American patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer."
10747931,"Project Summary: Precision approaches for inhibiting, preventing recurrence, or treating cancers remains a
top priority in the US. While different inhibitors have made significant improvements for these purposes (e.g.
immune checkpoint inhibitors, growth factor receptor inhibitors, etc.), it is clear that additional molecular targets
are needed to combine with these existing therapies due to the heterogeneity of cancers and the fact that
many cancers are resistant to different inhibitors. Thus, delineating new molecular mechanisms for
combinatorial approaches for more precision inhibition and therapy of cancer is of high significance. The
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-β/δ (PPARβ/δ) has great potential as a molecular target for
preventing and/or treating colorectal cancer (CRC). Typical ligands for PPARβ/δ increase and decrease target
gene expression. However, more selective, repressive PPARβ/δ ligands have recently been developed that
only repress gene expression rather than increase target genes. These selective repressive PPARβ/δ ligands
can markedly inhibit cellular events associated with cancer inhibition, progression and metastasis. There is no
dispute that selective, repressive PPARβ/δ ligands are effective anti-cancer molecules. These facts and
preliminary data provide strong support and rigor of the central hypothesis of this proposal that
repressing PPARβ/δ target genes by a selective, repressive ligand can modulate CRC and may be
targeted for precision approaches to inhibit/treat CRC. This hypothesis will be examined by 3 Aims. Aim 1
will include PK analysis of the selective, repressive PPARβ/δ ligand DG172 of tissue concentrations over time,
and phase I and phase II metabolism of the selective, repressive PPARβ/δ ligand in tissues, biofluids and
tumors. Aim 2 will determine the efficacy of the selective, repressive PPARβ/δ ligand DG172 to inhibit
tumorigenesis and stemness in novel orthotopic tumors models that utilize unique, genotypically variant human
cancer cell lines with genotypes that exhibit resistance to standard inhibitors used to treat CRC, and gain- and
loss-of-function models for PPARβ/δ. The mechanisms by which PPARβ/δ regulates stemness will also be
determined. For Aim 3, we will integrate genomic and metabolomic bioinformatic analyses to elucidate how
specific metabolic and tumor-promoting pathways that can be targeted by selective repressive PPARβ/δ
ligands to inhibit CRC progression and treat CRC. Data from Aim 3 will be made available to scientists by
developing a web-based platform to allow for systems analyses of PPARβ/δ-specific pathways that inhibit
CRC. Results from these studies will have a sustained impact as they will provide new PPARβ/δ-dependent
targets that might be combined with other inhibitors to develop more effective therapies, and prevent
recurrence, for CRC."

The long-term goal of this work is to understand how histone H3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me) and
heterochromatic gene silencing are epigenetically inherited. Heterochromatin is a conserved feature of
eukaryotic chromosmes and plays important roles in regulation of gene expression and maintenance of
chromosome stability in organisms ranging from yeast to human. Using the fission yeast
Schiozosaccharomyces pombe as a model organism, we recently demonstrated that ectopically induced
domains of H3K9me and silencing can be epigenetically inherited in the absence of sequence-specific
recruitment when the rate of H3K9me demethylation is reduced by deletion of the Epe1 anti-silencing factor. In
addition, we have discovered that, in wildtype epe1+ cells, small noncoding RNAs (siRNAs) or transcription
factor binding sites play critical roles in epigenetic maintenance of H3K9me. More recently, we have
uncovered roles for an RNAi-independent RNA decay pathaway, autoregulation of the conserved histone
H3K9 methyltransferase, and core replication fork-associated proteins in epigenetic maintenance of
heterochromatin. In this proposal we will use a combination of in vivo approaches and biochemical assays to
investigate (1) the functions of a newly discovered RNA decay complex, called the rixosome, in epigenetic
inheritance, (2) the role of a replication fork-associated chromatin assembly complex in retention of histones
and epigenetic inheritance during DNA replication, and (3) the role of a conserved ubiquitin ligase in regulation
of H3K9 methylation and accurate heterochromatin formation. The ultimate goal of these studies is a
molecular understanding of the mechanisms that epigenetically maintain silent chromatin domains."
10744768,"Analysis of calcium signaling in C. elegans
 The goal of this project is to analyze mechanisms controlling signaling by
voltage-activated calcium (CaV) channels. In neurons and muscles, brief cytoplasmic
calcium transients efficiently and rapidly activate downstream effectors, often on
millisecond time scales. One general mechanism that promotes signal speed and
efficiency is tight spatial coupling between CaV channels and their effectors, which is
termed calcium nanodomain signaling. We propose three Aims to study nanodomain
signaling by CaV channels. First, we identify genes required to promote coupling of
CaV1 (L-type) channels to two effectors, calcium activated BK potassium channels and
ryanodine receptors (RYR), which are calcium release channels in the endoplasmic
reticulum. Second, we test models for how the threshold is set for activity induced gene
transcription, and if this threshold is shifted by mutations in specific calcium activated
signaling components or by endogenous neuropeptides. Third, we ask how CaV1 and 2
channels are localized at presynaptic terminals, which dictates neurotransmitter release
probability. These Aims address fundamental mechanisms controlling neuron and
muscle physiology."

Infertility is a problem that affects one out of five couples, yet the cause of sterility is unknown in 30% of cases.
One threat to viable gamete development is activity of a subset of transposons known as endogenous
retroviruses (ERVs). ERVs have the ability to self-replicate and sometimes mobilize, creating new genomic
insertions within the same cell or even neighboring cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that, in
Drosophila, ERV activation within the follicle cells of developing eggs causes sterility. The current explanation
for ERV-triggered sterility postulates that ERVs migrate from the follicle cells into the oocyte and insert
themselves into new genomic loci, damaging DNA integrity. However, our lab has found no evidence of novel
ERV insertions being made into the oocyte genome, suggesting sterility may arise from uncharacterized
mechanism(s). Here, we propose an alternative explanation for transposon-triggered sterility: we hypothesize
that ERV derepression induces sterility through activation of an aberrant immune response. We found that
depletion of key immune pathway components rescued fertility despite ERV hyperactivity. These data provide
evidence that transposon-triggered sterility may be due to immune activation rather than DNA damage within
the oocyte. This proposal seeks to investigate how the immune system recognizes ERVs and whether that
immune response can cause sterility. Ultimately, these findings may provide an alternative explanation for
ERV-triggered sterility as well as advance our understanding of how ERVs impact human health."

Robotic devices for hand rehabilitation show promise in improving access to motor training and encouraging
functional use of the impaired limb. These devices can provide assistance for daily activities and augment
traditional rehabilitation methods. Wearable exoskeletons are a particularly exciting area of research because
they could provide therapy beyond the confines of a clinic or laboratory. Our use of surface electromyography
(EMG) sensors and intent detection algorithms has enabled individuals with post-stroke hemiparesis to intuitively
control a wearable robotic hand orthosis. However, a major barrier for adoption of this or similar devices is
excessive spasticity, which is amplified by users’ recruitment of all available muscles when exerting effort to
control the robot. This excessive coactivation of muscles when attempting movement patterns is a common
complication for stroke. Our work aims to address this problem by using EMG biofeedback, the display of real-
time information about muscle activation to the user, to co-train human-robot systems to generate motor patterns
when grasping that minimize excessive coactivation. Inspired by studies on visual biofeedback of muscle activity,
which have revealed promising results in rehabilitative training, our preliminary work with chronic stroke subjects
has indicated that some individuals retain some capacity to change muscle activation patterns in response to
EMG biofeedback. The goal of this research is to determine whether EMG biofeedback can be harnessed to
help train stroke survivors to modulate muscle activation and generate desired movement patterns with robot
assistance while minimizing unwanted coactivation and spasticity. This goal will be accomplished by pursuing
two aims. Aim 1 takes an assistive approach to biofeedback and robotic training. We will determine the extent of
flexor/extensor decoupling that is achievable when stroke survivors use EMG biofeedback with robotic
assistance. We expect EMG biofeedback to aid discrimination and generation of motor patterns that result in the
least abnormal coactivation. In Aim 1, subjects will participate in a single-session experiments that reinforce
robot-assisted hand movements in alignment with coordinated flexor/extensor activation. Aim 2 takes a
rehabilitative approach, and will investigate whether multi-session practice with EMG biofeedback and robotic
training produces rehabilitative effects and functional outcomes that persist after the orthosis is removed. To
achieve this, we will conduct a multi-session training regimen in which the orthosis requires a progressively
higher-fidelity activation signal in order to assist movement completion. The proposed project will provide insights
into the progression of human-robot fluency during training and greater understanding of motor learning after
stroke. This training complements my development plan by providing an opportunity to work with an
interdisciplinary mentoring and collaboration team to pursue a project at the intersection of robotics engineering
and stroke rehabilitation, and will ultimately prepare me to lead a translational research laboratory developing
patient-centered approaches to build devices to improve motor control in people with neurological disorders."

 2 Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease characterized by destruction of insulin producing β-cells due
3 to a combination of genetic risk and an unknown environmental trigger. A leading hypothesis for the
 4 environmental trigger is viral infection, during which the innate immune system releases various cytokines and
 5 interferons. Interferon alpha (IFN-α) has been long implicated in disease pathogenesis, with its presence
 6 observed in islets of donors with early-onset T1D. It has also been shown that IFN-α induces ER stress, MHC
 7 class 1 overexpression, and islet apoptosis, classical hallmarks of T1D development. For many years it was
 8 thought that all β-cells were destroyed in individuals with T1D. Recently, this dogma has been challenged with
 9 the discovery of residual insulin positive β-cells in donors with long-standing T1D. This suggests that β-cells are
10 heterogeneous, with one population of β-cells able to survive conditions of high stress. With these observations
11 in mind, the central goal of this proposal is to understand mechanisms behind heterogeneity of human β-cell
12 ROS response following IFN-α insult. I hypothesize that ROS accumulating β-cells, termed ‘ROSponders’
13 contain a unique molecular signature that promotes this heterogeneity in ROS accumulation, causing this subset
14 of cells to be more susceptible to oxidative stress and apoptosis. I will test this hypothesis through three specific
15 aims. Experiments in aim 1 are designed to characterize the molecular signature of ROSponders, with the goal
16 of identifying what makes them more susceptible to this ROS accumulation. In aim 2, I will determine the origin
17 of accumulating ROS. In aim 3, I will determine the fate of ROSponders through longitudinal intravital imaging.
18 With completion of these aims, the goal is to determine the mechanism and consequence of this observed
19 heterogeneity in ROS response. Importantly, through transcriptomics, this work will aim to identify novel targets
20 to prevent β-cell dysfunction under diabetogenic conditions, allowing for the development of future therapeutics
21 for disease prevention and/or treatment. A comprehensive understanding of islet function in early diabetes
22 pathogenesis and the use of cutting-edge techniques proposed in this grant will enable me to develop as a
23 scientist and set me on a trajectory to make real and lasting impacts in the field of diabetes. This F31 award
24 includes a 2-year training plan designed to achieve 4 main objectives: 1) develop a strong comprehension of
25 techniques and concepts used in diabetes research, 2) train in the use of different microscopy techniques, 3)
26 enhance written and oral scientific communication, and 4) train in the use and handling of mouse models for
27 diabetes research. In addition, I will benefit from the collaborative research environment provided by the Center
28 for Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases at the Indiana University School of Medicine. I will also benefit from an
29 advisory committee consisting of a diverse team of carefully selected and established NIH funded investigators
30 and a supportive research environment in the laboratory.

10929396,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Respiratory viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality,
accounting for approximately 2 million deaths per year and an even higher healthcare burden during
pandemics. Individuals over the age of 65 in particular, are susceptible to adverse outcomes during acute
respiratory illness. In addition to increased severity of acute disease, aged individuals are at higher risk of
developing chronic pulmonary sequelae – termed “post-acute sequelae of COVID-19” (PASC) in the context of
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Depending on the study criteria, 27-80% of convalescents have been found to develop
chronic disease and thus PASC is quickly developing into a major burden on healthcare systems worldwide.
Notably, this phenomenon is not only limited to SARS-CoV-2 and has been reported following several other
respiratory viral infections including influenza, SARS-CoV-1, MERS, RSV and rhinovirus. Increased
susceptibility of aged individuals to chronic pulmonary sequelae and adverse long-term outcomes remains a
consistent feature across all viruses. However, we have limited insight into the age-associated features
responsible for the development and maintenance of chronic pulmonary sequelae following acute viral injury.
Our lab and others have previously reported persistent dysregulation of immune responses following
respiratory viral infections during aging. Long-term maintenance of tissue resident CD8+ memory T- (CD8+ TRM)
cells was found to contribute to chronic pathology in aged lungs. The molecular mechanisms underlying this
pathological activity were previously unknown, but I now present data that CD8+ TRM cells persisting in aged
lungs contribute to impaired alveolar regeneration post viral injury. Upon depletion of CD8+ TRM cells in the
post-acute phase of infection, I observe a reduction in the long-term maintenance of Krt8+ transitional cells –
an intermediate state adopted by alveolar epithelial type 2 (ATII) cells prior to differentiation into ATI cells.
Coupled with the observed increase in ATI cells, these data indicate that CD8+ TRM cells impair the complete
differentiation of Krt8+ transitional cells into mature ATI cells, thereby compromising pulmonary function. I also
found that CD8+ TRM depletion results in reduced IL-1β levels, a cytokine known to regulate Krt8+ transitional
cell activity. Thus, my overall hypothesis is that CD8+ TRM cells persisting in aged lungs following viral
pneumonia contribute to chronic IL-1β release and thus impair Krt8+ transitional cell differentiation to promote
dysplastic lung repair. To address my hypothesis, I propose to 1) determine the contributions of CD8+ TRM cells
persisting in aged lungs to impaired alveolar regeneration and 2) elucidate the pathological mechanisms driven
by CD8+ TRM cells to promote dysplastic repair of aged lungs. Understanding this immune-epithelial progenitor
interaction would deepen our fundamental understanding of the role of the immune system in alveolar
regeneration and lung repair. Moreover, the proposed studies would pave the way for developing therapeutic
strategies to promote functional repair of aged lungs following severe viral pneumonia."

Otitis media (OM) is the most common diagnosis in pediatric patients seen for illness in the United States (1,2),
affects 90% of all children (3,4) and is the most common indication for antimicrobial therapy and surgery (5) in young
children. Despite many attempts to improve diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, OM continues its highly
prevalent impact on children and substantial ongoing morbidity (1,3,6-30). OM continues as the most common cause
of hearing loss (HL) in children and leads to speech, educational and other developmental delays (31-37). OM
causes life-threatening complications (22,27) and is expensive, resulting in over $5 billion annually in U.S. health
care expenditures (3,38). Despite the prevalence and difficulties with OM, diagnostic accuracy to allow appropriate
treatment is lacking, leading to misplaced resources in treating OM. This proposal builds on our central
hypothesis that enhanced diagnostic tools, specifically, optical coherence tomography (OCT), will yield
improved diagnosis and lead to reduced need for antibiotics to treat acute OM, reduced surgical
interventions for chronic otitis media, and overall fewer complications and cost associated with this disease.
In this proposal we will explore three specific aims. The first aim, part A, we will perform a comparative
assessment of middle ear (ME) pathology using pneumatic otoscopy (PO) and optical coherence tomography
(OCT) in pediatric patients that present to a primary care clinic with complaints of otalgia (ear pain) or OM, with
the hypothesis that OCT added to standard PO will improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce overall antibiotic
prescriptions. In part B of this aim, a comparative assessment of ME pathology using PO along with
audiology/tympanometry (TY) and OCT will be performed in pediatric patients that present to the pediatric
otolaryngology clinic with a referral for chronic otitis media with effusion (OME), with the hypothesis that OCT
added to standard PO and TY will improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce overall need for surgery in patients
with OME. In the second aim, using the OCT images captured in the previous aim, we will develop image
processing and machine learning algorithms for automated identification of effusions and biofilms in OCT image
data to augment OM diagnosis for medical decision making. Finally, using the OCT images captured previously,
along with our machine learning algorithms, we will establish OCT B-mode and M-mode image-based features
that predict the resolution or persistence of middle ear effusions over time. Collectively, this project will
demonstrate how these advances in diagnostic tools and algorithms will improve diagnosis and provide added
information for clinical decision making in the management of OM."
10754251,"During the previous two decades it has become apparent that genomic rearrangements are often the type of mutation that underlies neurological disease. This is so not only for neurodevelopmental disorders such as intellectual disability (ID) and different recognizable patterns of human malformation (e.g., Potocki-Lupski syndrome), but also for late-onset adult neurological disorders such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Moreover, genomic rearrangement can often underlie complex traits and sporadic diseases such as Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative processes. Contrary to prior interpretations, experimental evaluation of disease associated genomic rearrangements has often documented that they can be much more complex than anticipated. Complexities can occur at individual loci and give specific patterns for complex genomic rearrangements (CGR) as observed on genome-wide array CGH; such as duplication-normal-duplication (DUP-NML-DUP), or a triplication embedded within duplications (DUP-TRP-DUP). Furthermore, complexities can occur on a genomic level leading to complex chromosomal rearrangements (CCR) and the phenomena of chromothripsis observed both in cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as an unusual experimentally observed pattern of multiple de novo copy number variants (CNVs) spread apparently randomly throughout the genome. The elucidation of mechanisms that can generate such complexities is an emerging field. We propose to further characterize CGR that have been found in association with neurological disease. Specifically, we will investigate: 1) CGRs that consists of: i) a DUP-NML-DUP pattern and ii) a pattern of a triplicated segment in inverse orientation embedded within a duplicated segment of the genome (DUP-TRP/INV-DUP); these are newly observed types of CGR with one proposed mechanism elucidated in our previous application; 2) The mechanism for recurrent triplications; 3) Elucidate the underlying molecular characteristics and breakpoint junctions of CGR that are accompanied by long genomic stretches of absence of heterozygosity (AOH), and resulting in both genomic (CGR) and genetic (AOH) alterations; 4) Alu-Alu rearrangements and their role in genomic instability and disease and 5) We will attempt to isolate a gene important to the phenomena of multiple de novo CNV seemingly randomly distributed throughout the genome. The experimental approaches to be utilized to accomplish each one of these specific aims are now within our reach. These studies predominately require genomic approaches that enable genomewide assays of variation such as array comparative genomic hybridization, genomewide SNP chips, whole exome sequencing (WES), whole genome sequencing (WGS), and other mapping and molecular approaches for the delineation of specific breakpoint junctions. It is anticipated these studies will characterize these novel types of rearrangements and lend further insight into basic molecular mutational mechanisms driving gene and genome evolution and that can cause the myriad of neurological diseases."

 In the US, the burden of very low birth weight (VLBW; <1500 g) birth is borne disproportionately by
black (non-Hispanic black/African American) mothers who are 2.2-2.6 times more likely than nonblack mothers
to deliver VLBW infants, with 31% of all VLBW infants born to black mothers. This disparity is amplified
because black VLBW infants are significantly less likely to receive mother’s own milk (MOM) feedings from
birth until neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) discharge than nonblack infants, which precludes exclusive MOM
feedings for the first 6 months of life as recommended by authorities and adds to the lifelong burden of VLBW
birth. In addition, VLBW infants are susceptible to potentially preventable morbidities including late onset
sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and long-term neurodevelopmental problems,
which all increase risks of rehospitalization. A dose-response relationship exists between the amount of MOM
feedings and a reduction in the risk of these morbidities and their associated costs, with the greatest risk
reduction for all four morbidities afforded by high-dose MOM through to NICU discharge.
 Even though black mothers of VLBW infants initiate MOM provision at rates similar to nonblack mothers
and have similar goals to sustain MOM provision through to NICU discharge, there is a significant disparity in
MOM feedings at NICU discharge. Only the mother can mitigate the disparity in MOM feedings at NICU
discharge for the VLBW infant, and this maternal behavior involves adhering to a two-part regimen: 1)
sustaining breast pump use (6-8 times/day) for the entire NICU hospitalization (average = 73 days), and 2)
transporting the MOM that is pumped in the home to the NICU for infant feedings. These behaviors are
associated with out-of-pocket and opportunity costs that are borne by mothers, unlike inferior feeding
alternatives such as donor human milk and formula, which are paid for by NICUs. This randomized control trial
will test an intervention (NICU acquires MOM) developed to facilitate maternal adherence to this two-part
regimen by offsetting the aforementioned costs that serve as barriers to sustaining MOM feedings: a) free
hospital-grade electric breast pump, b) pickup of MOM, and c) payment for opportunity costs compared to
current standard of care (mother provides MOM). The primary outcome will be receipt of MOM at NICU
discharge, with secondary outcomes of volume of MOM pumped and total duration of pumping, infant’s receipt
of any MOM feedings, duration of MOM feedings, and cumulative dose of MOM received at NICU discharge.
Cost analyses will be performed to: 1) describe and compare the cost of the NICU acquiring MOM versus
NICU acquiring donor human milk if MOM is not available; and 2) compare the cost effectiveness of NICU
acquiring MOM versus mother providing MOM. This innovative trial will determine the effectiveness of the
intervention in reducing the disparity in MOM feedings and provide an economic analysis of the interventions,
yielding critical data impacting generalizability and likelihood of implementation of results."

 Loss of function of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors is one prominent cause of
genetic epilepsies since they are the primary inhibitory ion channels to maintain the excitation-inhibition
balance in the mammalian central nervous system. Currently, hundreds of clinical variants have been
identified in GABAA receptor subunits, causing their functional defects. Despite the development of
numerous anti-seizure drugs, about one-third of epilepsy patients are resistant to current drug
treatment, and many of them have genetic causes. Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand
the molecular mechanism for the loss of function of pathogenic GABAA receptors as well as to develop
a new therapeutic strategy to correct their function. It has been recognized that reduced surface
trafficking of GABAA receptor variants is one major molecular mechanism for their loss of function. To
reach the plasma membrane to carry out their function, GABAA receptor subunits need to fold and
assemble into pentameric receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Many epilepsy-causing GABAA
receptor variants predispose them to protein misfolding in the ER and thus excessive protein
degradation. Recently, we showed that we can correct the function of such variants by restoring their
trafficking to the plasma membrane. Therefore, the overall objective of this proposal is to understand
how cellular degradation pathways remove misfolding-prone GABAA receptor variants; furthermore, we
hypothesize that we can correct the folding of these pathogenic variants to enhance their surface
trafficking and thus function, as a novel strategy to treat genetic epilepsies. Here, in Specific Aim 1, we
will characterize the cellular degradation pathways that remove misfolding-prone GABAA receptor
clinical variants. In Specific Aim 2, we will elucidate a coordinated folding pathway that directs the
protein folding of GABAA receptors in the ER. In Specific Aim 3, we will use small molecules to correct
the folding and thus function of misfolding-prone GABAA receptor clinical variants."

During this time of rapid evolution and uncertain future in the US healthcare system, it is critical that the US
prepare a new generation of scientific leaders with the interdisciplinary training, flexible critical thinking skills
and real-world grounding to provide the necessary leadership to make sound decisions for our future. The
University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) and University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), widely

to harness collaboration, complementary skills, and training capacity of the two institutions to provide an
outstanding training experience that emphasizes the application of interdisciplinary advances in social,
behavioral, and data sciences to real world challenges of clinicians, healthcare delivery systems, and health
policy makers. The predoctoral program provides rigorous training in research methods central to HSR,
including data science, quasi-experimental methods, econometrics, and implementation science, as well as
opportunities to partner with health care organizations and systems to conduct research that is responsive to
their priorities. Predoctoral trainees are required to have previously completed coursework in epidemiology,
economics, and statistics, and during our program they complete courses in research design, advanced
statistics, health economics, public policy, and organization behavior. The four predoctoral traineeships are
selected on an annual basis and each can be reappointed for an additional year, depending on coursework
and research performance. The postdoctoral program, administered by the UCSF Philip R. Lee Institute for
Health Policy Studies, is a two-year fellowship program that provides intensive experiential HSR training to
doctorally-trained social and behavioral scientists, as well as doctoral-level health professionals with the
equivalent of an MPH degree. Throughout their training, trainees participate in biweekly colloquia at UCSF

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are vital components of gene expression programs controlling cellular
differentiation and function. lncRNAs act as scaffolds to recruit or sequester effector proteins. They may act in
cis and trans at multiple genomic sites. lncRNAs modulate transcription, chromatin organization, RNA
processing, and translation, and many questions remain unanswered regarding how they influence gene
expression. Recent reviews have detailed several lncRNAs that play key roles in prostate cancer including
regulation of processes in cancer cells such as proliferative signaling, replicative immortality, invasion and
metastasis, evasion of growth suppressors, induction of angiogenesis and resistance to apoptosis. While much
remains to be learned regarding the mechanisms of action involved in lncRNA function, it is abundantly clear
that lncRNAs act in concert with associated proteins to carry out their roles.
Distinguishing between aggressive and indolent prostate cancer is a major conundrum in cancer. In roughly
one-third of the 140,000 intermediate grade cancers (Gleason 7) diagnosed annually, the disease follows a
more aggressive course developing rapid progression of prostate specific antigen (PSA) after treatment and
earlier metastasis and death. During the prior three-year grant period, we discovered several dozen lncRNAs
that distinguish aggressive and indolent prostate cancers, of which four were validated using RT-qPCR. We
also developed the HyPR-MS strategy to permit elucidation of specific RNA-protein interactomes.
In this renewal proposal we seek to further develop and apply a suite of powerful new proteomics tools to study
these and other prostate cancer-relevant lncRNAs and the proteins that associate with them, and use this
capability to reveal important proteomic signatures to distinguish aggressive versus indolent prostate cancer.
These studies will provide a novel and unprecedented view into the nature of the proteoform–lncRNA
interactions that underlie lncRNA function. The delineation of differentially expressed lncRNAs and their
associated proteins/proteoforms will provide insight into the biological mechanisms underlying disease
progression and provide novel therapeutic targets for further development."

The Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) program capitalizes on diverse pregnancy and
pediatric cohorts to investigate the impact of a broad array of environmental influences on child health and
development. Since 2016, the Developmental Impact of NICU Exposures (DINE) study has significant
contribution of the to the ECHO mandate is a large, exquisitely phenotyped preterm birth cohort - a unique and
sensitive population with a demonstrated large burden of adverse health outcomes. The DINE cohort readily
combines rich existing clinical and research datasets and biospecimen repositories, existing infrastructure for
long-term follow up and assessments of multiple ECHO exposure and outcome specialization areas, and a novel
exposure and outcome profile that will continue high-yield contribution to ECHO program scientific goals.
In this second phase of the ECHO program, we will continue to focus on the scientific premise that early life
physical and chemical exposures, notably phthalates and air pollution, have long-lasting harmful effects on child
health and development, and that these harmful effects are magnified in children born preterm. DINE contributes
a unique and critically important population to ECHO in that preterm infants face significant dermal, inhalational
and intravenous exposures to phthalates, ubiquitous organic endocrine disrupting chemicals, while hospitalized
the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Premature infants experience a high prevalence of the adverse health
effects that are associated with early life exposure to phthalates in term-born children, particularly abnormalities
of pulmonary function. The contribution of environmental influences on adverse outcomes of preterm children is
poorly understood. One additional central tenet of our work is that preterm infants can be studied to identify
exposure-outcome links that may be more subtle in the general population. Large clinical studies like ECHO that
enroll participants born over the entire preterm-to-term continuum allow rigorously study of this premise.
Through the next phase of the ECHO program, we pursue the following Specific Aims in DINE:
 Aim 1. Leverage ECHO Cohort Protocol core data elements to compare exposure-outcome
 relationships in preterm compared to term populations.
 Aim 2. Leverage specialized data elements to address critical questions about the impact of early
 life chemical exposures on pulmonary development in a sensitive population, preterm infants.
 Aim 3. Implement procedures to maximize retention of existing participants with an emphasis on
 maintaining cohort diversity and protocol fidelity.
Continued involvement of preterm infants in ECHO is critical not only to our cohort’s scientific imperatives, but
also to the entire ECHO program as preterm infants constitute more than 10% of the United States population."

The goal of the second phase (2023-2030) of the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO)
Program is to extend and expand the ECHO Cohort to further investigate the impact of a broad range of early
social and biological exposures during the preconception period and into young adulthood, on ECHO’s five
key child health outcomes among diverse populations. Our pediatric ECHO cohort, ELGAN-ECHO, proposes
to continue to: (1) lead collaborative ECHO Cohort science, (2) follow up existing ECHO Cohort participants,
and (3) implement the ECHO Cohort Data and Biospecimen Collection Protocol. The broad goals of this
proposal are to: (1) evaluate predictors of exposure to environmental stressors (chemical and non-chemical)
during preconception, pregnancy, and early childhood; (2) identify factors that have the potential to modify the
relationships between environmental exposures, perinatal biomarkers of inflammation (e.g., epigenetic,
genomic and proteomic) and neurodevelopmental outcomes as our proposed specialty outcome area; and (3)
maximize retention of diverse ELGAN participants. We will bring specialized expertise in environmental
epidemiology related to metals, placental epigenetics, antecedents and correlates of preterm birth, and
neurodevelopmental outcomes to the proposed project. In the first two years of the project (the UG3 phase)
investigators from the ECHO-ELGAN team will collaborate with the ECHO Program to collaborate on the
development of the ECHO Cohort Protocol for the preconception period and harmonization of data; lead and
participate on ECHO committees, working groups, and task forces; plan participant follow-up, obtain approval
for conducting the ECHO Cohort Protocol with oversight from the ECHO Cohort Consortium’s single IRB;
reconsent existing ECHO Cohort participants; implement the ECHO Cohort Protocol for collection of data and
biospecimens specified in that protocol; use the central data capture system to populate the ECHO Cohort
Data Platform; retain study participants with an emphasis on diverse populations; and produce and
disseminate ECHO Cohort science through publications and other public presentations. In the following five
years (the UH3 phase) we will expand development, production, and dissemination of ECHO Cohort science,
and continue to lend expertise on maintaining high retention rates and fidelity to the ECHO Cohort Protocol.
Our over-arching perspective will be solution-oriented research questions that take advantage of the large
sample size, diversity, and longitudinal nature of the ECHO Cohort and have potential to influence practices,
programs, and policies to improve children’s health."

arm) to an in person DPP tailored for older adults (DPP arm) using a randomized, controlled trial design
(n=230). Our preliminary data suggests DPP-TOAT is a feasible and acceptable way to deliver the DPP to
older adults, and this will be the first study to compare the effectiveness and implementation of two strategies
(telehealth versus in-person) to deliver a tailored DPP for the unique needs of the growing population of older
adults. Eligible patients will be recruited through electronic health records (Epic and MyChart) and randomized
to the 12-month DPP-TOAT or the in-person DPP program. The primary effectiveness outcome will be 6-month
weight loss and implementation outcome will be attendance. We will use a pragmatic approach in order to
inform future studies conducted in community-based and rural settings. Findings will inform best practices in
the delivery of an evidence-based intervention that could reach the 24+ million adults aged 65 and over with
prediabetes."

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) contributes to high morbidity and mortality in children with diverse
cardiopulmonary and systemic diseases. Efforts to define optimal treatment strategies for pediatric PAH have
been limited by the absence of multicenter randomized controlled trials (MRCTs) and the lack of well-defined and
proven endpoints for studies in children. Pediatric PAH remains understudied and relatively little is known about
long-term outcomes, age-appropriate clinical endpoints and optimal therapeutic strategies for children. Drug
treatment remains suboptimal as MRCTs are rare in children with PAH and current decision-making is dependent
on data from adult studies or small case series in children. Based on recent success of MRCTs in establishing a
new standard of care for adult PAH patients, we propose to study the potential role for initial up-front combination
treatment of PAH in children consisting of two PAH-specific oral therapies that have been shown to be well-
tolerated in children as monotherapies: sildenafil (a type V phosphodiesterase inhibitor) and bosentan (an
endothelin receptor antagonist). Recent studies in adult PAH suggest that initiation of combined therapy with a
phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor and an endothelin receptor antagonist at the time of diagnosis, rather than
sequential combination therapy, improves pulmonary hemodynamics, exercise tolerance and quality of life when
compared with monotherapy. Children with PAH often require additional therapies over time in the setting of
disease progression or incomplete responsiveness to monotherapy, however, there are no data regarding the
potential benefits of greater and more sustained clinical improvement over time with the more aggressive
combination therapy approach from the time of initial diagnosis. Studies of pediatric PAH have been further
limited by the lack of well-coordinated and experienced care programs and the relative rare nature of these
diseases. With the collaboration of the Pediatric Pulmonary Hypertension Network (PPHNet), a highly interactive
and multidisciplinary group of academic PH programs, we propose to test the hypothesis that initiation of
up-front combination therapy with sildenafil and bosentan at the time of PAH diagnosis will result in
improved WHO Functional Class (FC) at 12 months in comparison with the current standard approach,
which is sildenafil therapy alone. Overall, this study addresses critical gaps in pediatric PAH by testing a clinical
strategy with strong potential for broad impact, and by defining useful study endpoints or novel surrogates that will
facilitate evidence-based decision-making and enhance the care of children with PAH."

Significant knowledge gaps exist regarding intergenerational dimensions of cognitive aging and risk for Alz-
heimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD), and how these processes differ
across race and ethnic groups. The proposed Add Health Parent Study (AHPS) Phase 2 is designed to ad-
dress these gaps. AHPS is an ongoing study of social, behavioral, and biological factors influencing healthy
aging and the development of AD/ADRD in a national sample of adults currently aged 58-90. Sample members
are parents of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) cohort, initially inter-
viewed in Add Health in early midlife (1994-95) before differential survival could contribute bias to sample rep-
resentation. Phase 1 of AHPS (2015-17) collected longitudinal data on a random subsample of parents and
their spouse/partners (S/P, N= 3001), the majority (73%) of whom were Non-Hispanic (NH) White. Phase 2 of
AHPS will collect social, behavioral, and health data on all available NH Black and Hispanic parents (BHS sup-
plement, N= 2,505), and cognitive assessments and DNA data on all AHPS Phase 1 and BHS sample parents
and their current S/P (total N= 5,506). By adding NH Black and Hispanic parents, AHPS will be sufficiently sta-
tistically powered to address, for the first time, measurement of health, social, and behavioral differences in
AD/ADRD risk and protective factors across race/ethnic groups and socioeconomic strata.
Combined data from AHPS Phases 1 and 2 will be linked with rich longitudinal data on original Add Health re-
spondents to create and disseminate the first nationally representative multigenerational biosocial resource
with cognitive, genomic, behavioral, and social data for the study of racial/ethnic disparities in cognitive aging
and AD/ADRD risk. Cognition and genomic data will be harmonized across the two generations of parents and
children for innovative analysis of intergenerational predictors of AD/ADRD; the role of genetic processes in
AD/ADRD etiology; and intergenerational and lateral caregiving. Project specific aims are:
1a. Recruit and interview additional sample of 2,505 NH Black and Hispanic parents with the AHPS survey.
1b. Consent all 5,506 AHPS members for participation in AD/ADRD Assessment and DNA data collection.
2a. Collect DNA and conduct SNP genotyping and DNA methylation analysis on AHPS sample.
2b. Develop an intergenerational genomic database to advance an understanding of the gene-environment
interplay in the etiology of AD/ADRD.
3a. Examine novel longitudinal and intergenerational social, health, and behavioral risk and preventive factors
for AD/ADRD across racial/ethnic groups and social strata.
3b. Examine AHPS members’ caregiving experiences and the socioeconomic consequences of caregiving ex-
periences related to AD/ADRD conditions or risks.
4. Document, disseminate, and promote use of AHPS data to the global scientific community."
10745998,"Neuronal survival or death depends strongly on mitochondrial function and metabolic signaling following
stroke. Ischemic stroke causes changes in mitochondrial function that, depending on severity or persistence,
can result in either damage or protection. However, the mechanisms that regulate the balance between these
outcomes are not fully understood, but likely depend on how, when and where mitochondrial function changes.
As mitochondrial function and signaling are dependent on the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), our
central hypothesis is that neuronal ischemic outcomes depend on the timing and degree of Δψm
(de)polarization. Currently, the field lacks tools to assess the contribution of Δψm to ischemic outcomes
independent of other variables. Our proposal addresses this gap by applying a novel optogenetic approach to
regulate the Δψm, thereby dissociating it from upstream metabolism. Conventional optogenetic approaches use
light-sensitive proteins to control neuronal plasma membrane potentials. Here we will apply this approach in
mitochondria to either increase or decrease the Δψm in response to different wavelengths of light. We will use a
novel CRISPR/Cas9 method to express our light-activated proteins at single-copy levels to take unprecedented
spatial and temporal control of bioenergetics in vivo. This system can mimic or reverse the Δψm changes that
occur during stroke. Combined with the power of C. elegans genetics and epistasis, this approach will probe
the molecular mechanisms that mediate mitochondrial signaling in hypoxic pathology. Using neuron-selective
gene expression, we will test how mitochondrial function affects ischemic outcomes in different types of
neurons. In addition, we will characterize how bioenergetics influences the neuronal circuits that signal during
ischemic pathology. Overall, the results of our approach will allow us to integrate the contribution of Δψm, an
elusive, dependent variable, to stress outcomes in order to better guide future therapeutic strategies."

Aging is a complex process where perturbation of multiple molecular pathways contributes to organ
deterioration and aging-related morbidity and mortality. One component of the aging process is severe
dysregulation of gene expression that contributes to changes in the proteome of aged cells, which can
compromise cell function. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for aging-induced perturbation of gene
expression will be key to develop the necessary medical therapies. Although significant progress has been
made in understanding the transcriptional changes occurring with aging, very little is known about how post-
transcriptional events, such as RNA modifications, control protein synthesis during aging. In this proposal we
will examine the role of METTL3-mediated m6A mRNA methylation in the context of aging using muscle aging
as a model system. We hypothesize that METTL3-dependent mRNA methylation regulates the process of
aging by controlling the translation of specific pro-hypertrophic mRNAs. For the first time, utilizing gain- and
loss-of-function approaches we will characterize this novel regulatory program by establishing the molecular
mechanisms by which m6A regulates the life of select mRNAs and assess the global aging- and METTL3-
dependent translation dynamics (aim 1), examining the therapeutic benefit of enhancing m6A content to
counteract sarcopenia in clinically relevant animal models (aim 2), and define the role of m6A binding proteins
in muscle aging (aim 3). Completion of the proposed aims will allow the uncovering of a novel mechanism
responsible for post-transcriptional regulation of aging with significant therapeutics ramifications."

Alcohol and illicit drug use during the past month increased from 2019 to 2020 among pregnant women. Of
women abstaining from substance use during pregnancy, up to 51% relapse by 3 months postpartum. Importantly,
maternal substance use continues throughout childhood and adolescence, with 1 in 8 children under the age of
17 in the United States living with at least one parent with a substance use disorder. While previous work has
evidenced prenatal substance exposure effects on child neurocognitive outcomes, prior assessments have
overlooked the impact of being raised in households where substance use continues after delivery and
throughout childhood. Further, this prior work has focused on prenatal substance use exposure in isolation
without considering other psychological risk factors highly comorbid with substance use. Therefore, it is critical
to identify the impact of substance use during pregnancy and beyond on child neurocognitive functioning, and
determine whether substance use, or the myriad of psychological risk factors associated with substance use,
shape child neurocognitive development. Here, I will analyze data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive
Development (ABCD) Study to assess the impact of prenatal and household substance exposure independently
and in concert with maternal psychological risk on child executive functioning during early adolescence through
measures of neural and behavioral correlates of executive functioning. Together, this work will provide further
evidence of prenatal substance exposure effects on child neurocognitive development, highlighting the
importance of continued household exposure to substance use and broader maternal psychological risk to child
outcomes. Further, this approach will recognize the importance of psychological symptoms beyond substance
use and provide an empirical foundation for future lifespan assessments of maternal psychopathology and its
impact on other domains of children’s neurocognitive functioning. Finally, clinical implications include informing
intervention and treatment programs for families affected by substance use by necessitating parenting-specific
support across the lifespan and recognition of co-morbid psychological symptoms."

Renal cell carcinoma is the most common primary kidney cancer, representing 90-95% of primary renal
neoplasms. Obesity and diabetes are associated with an increased risk of renal cell carcinoma, but the
mechanisms by which systemic metabolic changes promote tumor progression are unknown. Although its
reputation as a glucose-producing organ has been dwarfed by that of the liver over the years, the kidney
possesses the same complement of gluconeogenic enzymes as the liver – with a higher concentration of
gluconeogenic proteins per gram of tissue in the kidney, suggesting that its gluconeogenic capacity may even
exceed the liver's. Glucose is well-known to be a crucial substrate for tumor growth; given the gluconeogenic
activity of the kidney, it is likely that increased renal gluconeogenesis may fuel tumor growth. However, this
phenomenon, and its mechanistic explanation, remains to be explored. We have recently found that fibroblast
growth factor-21 (FGF-21) promotes renal gluconeogenesis during starvation by activating intrarenal lipolysis
through a 2-adrenergic pathway, thereby activating pyruvate carboxylase flux in healthy rodents. Therefore,
this proposal will test the Overarching Hypothesis that in renal cell carcinoma, increased FGF-21 acts
through a similar mechanism to promote intrarenal lipolysis, pyruvate carboxylase activity, and as a result,
gluconeogenesis, and that this increased renal glucose supply fuels tumor growth. We will also examine the
utility of an FGF-21 neutralizing antibody against mice genetically prone to renal cell carcinoma, which we
anticipate will reduce renal gluconeogenesis and renal cell carcinoma progression. If the hypotheses are
confirmed, these data would identify FGF-21 – which is already being targeted in advanced clinical trials for
metabolism- and diabetes-related indications – as a potential therapeutic target in renal cell carcinoma."

Streptococcus pyogenes infections are a major burden to the healthcare system in the United States and
globally. Most infections are mild and superficial, such as pharyngitis and impetigo. However, rapid disease
progression may result in life-threatening invasive infections, such as necrotizing fasciitis and toxic shock
syndrome. Furthermore, recovered patients often suffer post-infection chronic complications, including acute
rheumatic heart disease. Altogether, S. pyogenes infections and post-infection complications result in more than
600,000 global deaths annually. Currently, there is no vaccine against S. pyogenes and high instances of
morbidity and mortality highlight the urgent need for alternative treatment strategies. Unlike most pathogens, S.
pyogenes thrives in inflammatory environments by expressing virulence factors that promote immune evasion,
which is often associated with invasive infections. Approximately 15% of the genome, including most virulence
factors, is regulated by a two-component system called CovRS (or CsrRS). CovRS detects the host peptide LL-
37, which functions as a potent signal for virulence factor regulation. However, it remains unclear how changes
in LL-37 availability due to cell death alters CovRS regulation during the progression of an infection. Further,
distinct toxins of S. pyogenes are expressed in CovRS “on/off” activity states, yet all are essential during infection.
This indicates that sub-populations of genetically identical bacteria in different CovRS “on/off” states may release
varying toxins during different stages of infection and within distinct microenvironments that collectively
contribute to pathogenesis. I hypothesize that heterogenous CovRS regulation is controlled by variations of LL-
37 levels due to inflammatory cell death, allowing heterogenous toxin production necessary for S. pyogenes
infections. I will test my hypothesis by 1) using genetics techniques within the host and pathogen to identify how
inflammatory cell death impacts LL-37 release and CovRS regulons, and 2) using microscopy for single cell
analysis to examine how local LL-37 concentration contributes to CovRS signaling in engineered S. pyogenes
reporter strains. Collectively, these studies will provide insight into the mechanisms responsible for S. pyogenes-
induced inflammation and identify novel drug targets that stall disease progression."

DNA mismatch repair (MMR) systems act to excise misincorporation errors that occur during DNA replication.
In eukaryotes MSH proteins recognize these errors in the context of base-base and insertion/deletion
mismatches and recruit MLH complexes to form ternary complexes that work with replication factors (RPA,
RFC, PCNA) and Exo1 to excise the newly replicated DNA strand through the mismatch site. This is followed
by DNA re-synthesis steps. MMR factors also recognize mismatches that form during strand invasion steps in
homologous recombination; they recruit a helicase complex that unwinds (rejects) recombination intermediates
and allows a new homology search. In addition, subsets of MMR factors act in meiosis to resolve
recombination intermediates into crossovers (COs). In baker’s yeast the majority of meiotic COs are formed in
an interference-dependent pathway in which double Holliday junctions (dHJs), thought to be stabilized by
Msh4-Msh5, are resolved through the actions of STR helicase/topoisomerase, Exo1 nuclease, and the MutLγ
(Mlh1-Mlh3) endonuclease. Our work is focused on developing molecular models to explain how the different
MSH and MLH factors act in the above pathways. This work will enable us to understand how molecular
defects in these factors underlie human infertility and hereditary forms of colon cancer, and how chromosomal
rearrangements can lead to disease. We will test these ideas through three distinct research themes. In
Project 1 we are studying how conformational changes in MLH proteins, mediated by ATP binding and
hydrolysis, are linked to strand specificity steps in MMR and meiotic recombination. We will use genetic
(mutations in intrinsically disordered domains in Mlh1-Pms1 and Mlh1-Mlh3 and force dimerization of MLH
proteins), biochemical (in vitro reconstitution reactions to determine specific roles for MLH proteins in MMR and
mass-spectrometry) and single-molecule (examine diffusion along DNA and how proteins bypass barriers)
approaches. Project 2 is focused on understanding how MutLγ acts to resolve dHJs in the ZMM pathway. Our
work in the current grant period is consistent with MutLγ endonuclease being activated in MMR and meiotic
crossing over through the formation of a MutLγ filament. We will use this information and biochemical, mass
spectrometry, and genetic methods that take advantage of our identification of mlh3 separation of function
mutants to identify MutLγ interacting factors. Our early work encourages us to initially focus on MutLγ
interactions with the Exo1 nuclease, after which we will test identified factors alone and in combination for their
ability to interact with MutLγ to cleave model HJ and dHJ substrates. Project 3 is aimed at understanding how
the decision is made to repair or reject recombination intermediates. We will analyze how mutations in histone
chaperones and deacetylases, separately and in combination, affect anti-recombination, and will employ an
inducible system to provide a temporal and physical measure of these effects. This work will also encourage us
to pursue a genome-wide screen to identify new factors that regulate the repair/rejection decision."

10897885,"Influenza viruses are rapidly mutating RNA viruses and are the causative agent of about one billion annual
respiratory virus infections and 500,000 deaths worldwide. Influenza-related deaths are generally attributable to
viral or bacterial pneumonia (from secondary bacterial infections); excessive inflammation resulting in acute
respiratory distress syndrome; and severe lung immunopathology, leading to hypoxia and multi-organ failure.
Influenza viruses have significant pandemic potential, seasonal epidemics burden the human population, and
viral resistance has developed to all available treatment options. Much emphasis is placed on the humoral
immune response to influenza, as neutralizing antibodies are the desired vaccine outcome. However, B cell-
deficient mice and humans with hyper-IgM syndrome clear influenza virus infections, while T cell-deficient mice
do not. Thus, B cell-independent mechanisms protect against influenza virus-related mortality. However, the
immune response to influenza virus infection remains poorly understood, and much-needed therapeutics
augmenting the antiviral immune response while preventing harmful immunopathology remain to be developed.
To address this knowledge gap, we recently generated novel and compelling evidence that Influenza A virus
(IAV) infection triggers lung mast cells (MCs) to produce the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (MC-IL-10). In wild-
type (WT) and T- and B-cell deficient (Rag1-KO) mice, IAV/MC-IL-10 induces the expression of the IL-10 receptor
(IL-10R) and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) on Natural Killer (NK) cells. Notably, in Rag1-KO mice,
where NK cells are the sole virus-fighting lymphocytes, PD-L1 blockade, but not PD-1, PD-L2, or CD80 blockade,
significantly reduces IAV-related lethality. The IAV/MC-IL10/NK-PD-L1 pathway is also conserved in humans, at
least in vitro: IAV infection of human-lung tissue-derived single-primary-cell suspensions or intact human lung
tissue slices elicit MC-IL-10 and NK cell-expressed IL-10R and PD-L1. In mice and humans, T cells also
upregulate the IL-10R, PD-1, and PD-L1 upon IAV infection. Further, IAV-infected IL-10-KO/Rag-WT mice,
whose NK and T cells do not upregulate IL-10R, PD-1, PD-L1, or PD-L2, and IAV-infected WT mice in which
PD-L1 is blocked, develop prolonged immune infiltration and immunopathology after IAV clearance. Our findings
are novel and surprising. The induction of the PD/PD-L pathway is generally associated with lymphocyte
exhaustion (via T cell-expressed PD-1) in cancer or chronic infection rather than the modulation of lymphocyte
function in response to an acute viral illness. We hypothesize that influenza virus-induced MC-IL-10 balances
helpful antiviral responses with harmful immunopathology through PDL1 signaling in NK cells, and PD-1 and/or
PD-L1 signaling in T cells. We propose identifying the mechanisms of IAV/MC/IL-10/PD-L1-mediated NK cell
and IAV/MC/IL-10/PD-1 and/or PD-L1-mediated T cell regulation and each pathway's contribution to viral
clearance vs. lung tissue damage. Our proposal is highly significant to human health, as it has great potential to
identify therapeutic targets for alleviating IAV immunopathology-associated mortality and morbidity."

Schizophrenia (SZ) is a severe mental health disorder currently treated with antipsychotic drugs which often
have serious side effects, are ineffective in ~30% of patients, and are not useful as a preventive treatment. With
its burden estimated at $343.2 billion in the US alone, there is a pressing need to improve early identification
strategies for SZ and treatments that improve functioning. A better understanding of the underlying neurobiology
is key to achieving these goals. Advances in global, large-scale, collaborative neuroimaging efforts are able to
generate replicable findings on brain abnormalities in SZ and assess contributions of clinical and confounding
variables. Our prior work within the ENIGMA (Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis) SZ
working group identified predominantly gray matter deficiencies such as smaller subcortical volumes and thinner
cortex in SZ. However, our findings also highlighted the importance of confounding variables on such clinical
neuroimaging data, such as antipsychotic medication or disease chronicity. In contrast, the ENIGMA Schizotypy
(SZT) working group, studying well-functioning healthy individuals who self-report subclinical psychotic traits,
recently found that higher SZT was associated with thicker cortex. Moreover, the cortical thickness profile in SZT
was inversely related with the profile of cortical thinning in SZ. Based on these findings, we posit that a
comprehensive characterization of neural abnormalities at the extremes of the SZ spectrum continuum may not
only further our understanding of the low liability (SZT) and high liability (SZ) ends of the spectrum but may also
have wider implications for the prediction of risk and resilience in SZ (functioning) and in individuals at clinical
high-risk for psychosis. This innovative global initiative will be first to integrate data across ENIGMA SZT and SZ
cohorts with structural MRI (sMRI), detailed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and resting-state functional MRI
(rsfMRI) to address the following key questions in SZ research: what are the functional and structural connectivity
signatures of SZT and SZ? How are these signatures related to symptom severity, and global functioning? Can
label-noise reduced dimensional measures of SZT and SZ liability based on these multimodal neuroimaging
measures predict poor functioning? Leveraging global data and expert teams from minimally 24 to possibly well
over 100 cohorts, we will tackle imaging, clinical, and predictive questions about the SZ spectrum with
unprecedented power. This project will employ standardized image analyses, quality assurance, and statistical
analysis procedures across cohorts with multimodal neuroimaging and clinical data from the same individuals.
This will yield replicated FC and SC signatures of SZT and SZ, determine relationships between neuroimaging
markers of SZT and SZ, and relationships with symptom dimensions and functioning. It will deliver machine-
learning based models that can be used to generate imaging-based, dimensional, biomarkers that may serve as
treatment targets, predictors of clinical outcome, or predictors of conversion to psychosis in at-risk populations."

The development of broadly neutralizing antibodies (BNAbs) remains an ambitious objective for effective vaccine
responses. Methods to reliably elicit BNAbs are not known, nor are the mechanisms for their natural development
fully understood. Prior work, including research from our lab, has identified a handful of germline immunoglobulin
(Ig) variable (V) gene alleles more likely to become broadly neutralizing antibodies for HIV, influenza, and
autoimmunity. Unfortunately, this barely scratches the surface of the over 500 documented alleles broadly
distributed across populations. We will work closely with experimental collaborators to develop computational
methods accelerating Ig characterization with the long-term goal of BNAbs discovery. Success in these
endeavors will contribute to the development of personalized healthcare and vaccination strategies, and increase
our understanding of this critical component of the adaptive immune response.
This proposal will take advantage of the growing quantity of single cell (SC) data being produced, which allows
RNA expression to combine with Ig repertoires to confer a host of useful biological context to analyze. Despite
the advantages of SC data and its potential to immunology analysis forward, it remains either missing or
represents a fractional percentage of adaptive immune receptor repertoire (AIRR) datasets in public repositories
due to a lack of analysis tools appropriate to the challenges of SC. To address this problem, we will develop Ig
analysis methods leveraging SC data. Our goals are to improve coverage and accuracy of Ig V gene analysis
and identify germline alleles associated with differential Ig expression and immunological outcomes. This is an
early critical step in promoting broad use of SC data in AIRR analyses, understanding the complex interplay
between Ig and factors not captured within the allelic sequence, and linking AIRR analysis to multi-omics data.
Results will additionally guide future studies with experimental collaborators and advance novel methodology
suited for Ig genes and B cell biology of diseases."

Many social behaviors, such as defense and aggression, are innate- requiring no prior experience to be
expressed and presumably ‘hardwired’ into neural circuits. Interestingly, however, these ‘hardwired’ behaviors
vary in expression among individuals and can be altered by experience. What are the neural circuits and
mechanisms that support such flexible expression of innate behaviors? The ventrolateral, ventromedial
hypothalamus (VMHvl) controls innate social behaviors including aggression and social defense, but whether
VMHvl encodes individual differences in the expression of these behaviors, or how VMHvl may mediate
experience-dependent behavioral changes is not understood. An experience that exposes individual
differences in innate behavior and induces experience-dependent changes to aggression and defense
behavior is chronic social defeat stress (CDS). CDS induces persistent changes to VMHvl activity- but the cell-
types, circuits, and mechanisms involved in these transformations are unidentified. This proposal will use CDS
to produce a range of social behavior decisions and dissect the cell-types, circuits, and synaptic mechanisms
that mediate these decisions using multiple levels of analysis. This includes in-vivo imaging of individual
neurons to characterize the activity dynamics of VMHvl throughout the course of CDS, electrophysiological
recordings to uncover the cellular and synaptic signatures of CDS in VMHvl circuits, and in-vivo optogenetic
manipulation during behavior to perturb VMHvl CDS-plasticity. This proposal constitutes significant technical
and conceptual training in circuit-mapping, in-vivo recordings, in-vivo circuit manipulation, cell-type and input-
specific synaptic plasticity, and computational and quantitative methods of analysis. Together, completion of
this research will elucidate the experience-dependent transformations to VMHvl circuit dynamics that occur
throughout social stress, and relate these transformations to individual differences in stress outcome.
Examining these relationships will provide insight to the mechanisms underlying stress-plasticity, which provide
insight to stress-related mental health disorders."

Prior research has documented substantial differences in levels of physiological stress among Black- and White-
identifying individuals during adolescence, a period of particular importance from a developmental perspective,
which may shape disparities in chronic disease in adulthood. The proposed project seeks to explore the role of
exposure to multiple dimensions of activity-space adversity (ASA) – including area-level violence, elevated
policing, and racial exclusivity – in contributing to everyday (real-time) perceptions of both physical and
psychological unsafety and their contribution to explaining racial physiological stress disparities during
adolescence (Aim 1). We will also consider the impact of ASA exposures, unsafety perceptions, and
physiological stress as predictors of substance use and mental health outcomes (Aim 2). We will explore the
moderating influence of other-perceived race – or the degree to which an individual believes others perceive
their race to be Black in public interactions – on ASA exposure and unsafety effects on physiological stress and
health outcomes. The project will collect aim-relevant data on a racially diverse cohort of adolescents residing in
the Columbus, OH metropolitan area employing an innovative two-stage design: The first phase will produce rich
cross-sectional data (N=700) including standard survey items for youth and their caregivers; estimates of youth
ASA exposures from self-reported routine activity locations combined with extensive contextual ratings and
administrative data, physiological stress markers (cortisol and inflammatory), and health outcomes. The second
phase will involve a supplemental intensive longitudinal data collection period taking place over a six-month
period for a subsample of Phase 1 youth (N=300) selected using a novel exposure-based sampling strategy.
Data collected during this supplemental phase will include an unprecedented combination of continuous high-
resolution GPS tracking; ecological momentary assessments of perceived psychological and physical safety;
continuously-sensed heart rate variability; and hair cortisol concentration and C-reactive protein measured at
three additional time points. In addition to analyses of the novel data sources produced by the project, by drawing
on data from the Adolescent Health and Development in Context Study (2014-2016) previously conducted by
our study team, we will also examine recent historical changes in ASA exposures, racial disparities in safety and
physiological stress, and their health consequences."

Post-translational modification of N-terminal α-amino groups is a highly conserved and vastly utilized process
seen in all species from bacteria to mammals. Dr. Schaner Tooley pioneered the field of N-terminal
methylation by identifying the first two eukaryotic N-terminal methyltransferases, NRMT1 and NRMT2. She
went on to characterize the consensus sequence of these enzymes, identify dozens of their substrates, and
show N-terminal methylation regulates protein/DNA interactions. Her lab was also the first to show that, like
histone PTMs, Nα-PTMs are part of a functional code. They identified the first protein known to exist in both

create distinct proteoforms of MYL9, with unique protein binding partners, internal PTM patterns, and cell
compartment-specific functions. They have also demonstrated important roles for NRMT1 in oncogenesis

biochemistry of NRMT1 regulation, identify additional substrates regulated by the Nα-PTM code, and
mechanistically characterize a newly discovered role for NRMT1 in stem cell fate determination. Successful

Post-translational modification of N-terminal α-amino groups is a highly conserved and vastly utilized process
seen in all species from bacteria to mammals. Dr. Schaner Tooley pioneered the field of N-terminal
methylation by identifying the first two eukaryotic N-terminal methyltransferases, NRMT1 and NRMT2. She
went on to characterize the consensus sequence of these enzymes, identify dozens of their substrates, and
show N-terminal methylation regulates protein/DNA interactions. Her lab was also the first to show that, like
histone PTMs, Nα-PTMs are part of a functional code. They identified the first protein known to exist in both
Nα-acetyl and Nα-methyl forms, Myosin Light Chain 9 (MYL9). They demonstrated that these two Nα-PTMs
create distinct proteoforms of MYL9, with unique protein binding partners, internal PTM patterns, and cell

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are related, often comorbid,
neurodegenerative disorders with no available disease-modifying therapies. In over 95% of ALS patients, and
50% of FTD patients, affected neurons exhibit cytoplasmic mislocalization and accumulation of TDP43
(transactive response element DNA/RNA binding protein, 43 kDa). Mutations in TARDBP, the gene encoding
TDP43, also cause familial forms of ALS and FTD, highlighting an integral contribution of TDP43 to these
conditions. Even so, the mechanisms underlying TDP43 mislocalization in disease remain unclear.
Recent evidence from our laboratory suggests that TDP43 mislocalization may be due to the production of
alternatively spliced, shortened (s)TDP43 isoforms that are actively exported from the nucleus and prone to
aggregation. sTDP43 isoforms are also evolutionarily conserved, but their regulation and function remain
fundamentally unknown.
This proposal seeks to elucidate the distinct function of sTDP43 isoforms and their potential contribution to
disease by (i) defining the native transcript and protein interactors for sTDP43; and (ii) investigating a potential
role for sTDP43 in regulating RNA stability. In so doing, these studies may reveal new pathways responsible for
TDP43 mislocalization and neurodegeneration ALS and FTD. Additionally, it will enable me to develop essential
skills in bioinformatics, proteomics, experimental design, data analysis, and scientific communication that will be
critical for my success in my intended career as an independent investigator focused on the molecular
underpinnings of neurodegeneration."
10749935,"Project Summary/Abstract: One of the least understood computations in the brain is timing. We propose to
combine large-scale simulations with eyelid conditioning experiments to reveal temporal coding mechanisms
that underlie the cerebellum’s capacity for timing. The feasibility and power of this approach is facilitated by
several related factors. Eyelid conditioning provides the ability to control cerebellar inputs and infer its output.
Indeed, cerebellar timing is most clearly revealed in this way. This eyelid conditioning-cerebellum connection
makes it possible to test large-scale cerebellar simulations in quantitative and biological relevant ways. There is
also a natural synergy arising from combining simulations with experiments when each can be related with the
other – simulation results suggest better experiments and interpretation of data, experiments inform simulations
and make them more relevant and useful. The proposed studies are based on two relatively new discoveries
about cerebellar connectivity: Golgi cells inhibit each other and deep cerebellar nucleus (DCN) neurons send
collateral axons back to cerebellar cortex as mossy fibers. Preliminary data from simulations and experiments
suggest these two connections confer the cerebellum with its capacity for timing and temporal coding.
Simulations suggest specific predictions that can be tested with eyelid conditioning studies that include
behavioral analysis, tetrode recordings and opto-genetic silencing of specific neurons. Results will inform more
general theories of how neurons and synapses can implement temporal coding."

Adolescents (age 12-17) are disproportionally impacted by mental health challenges. Suicide is a leading cause
of death among this age group, with rates of psychiatric inpatient service use consistently increasing since the
mid-2000s. Youth psychiatric hospitalization can be traumatic for families and the period following hospitalization
is associated with increased risk of repeat suicide attempts and rehospitalization. Increased risk during this time
may be due, in part, to low rates of follow-up service use. One factor that plays a substantial role in youth service
use is parental burden (i.e., difficulties perceived to be caused or exacerbated by a child's psychiatric symptoms).
However, research has not yet explored how parental burden is related to follow-up service use in the post-
hospitalization period, or how disparities may influence this relation. Familial socioeconomic status (SES) may
be particularly important to consider in this context. There exists a myriad of barriers faced by families of lower
SES that impact access to and quality of mental health care. The present study seeks to address these gaps
using a mixed methods design. The first aim of this study is to investigate the bidirectional associations between
parental burden and youth service use over time following discharge from psychiatric hospitalization. The second
aim is to examine how SES impacts the longitudinal relations between parental burden and youth service use.
The third aim is to compare the lived experiences of 252 mothers with a recently psychiatrically hospitalized
adolescent from high and low SES backgrounds, with a focus on perceptions of burden. Broadly, the fellow’s
training goals associated with the proposed study and long-term career plans are to: develop comprehensive
knowledge of relevant literatures, such as processes of post-traumatic growth and stress in families, health
disparities, and culturally responsive care with underserved youth and families; develop proficiency in qualitative,
mixed-methods, and advanced quantitative statistical design and analysis; and improve research dissemination
skills. This will be accomplished through coursework, attendance at targeted workshops, hands-on research and
clinical experience, directed readings, and regular mentorship meetings. With the support of a dedicated and
experienced mentorship team, this research study and training plan will set the stage for the fellow’s long term
research goal, which is to conduct culturally responsive, trauma-informed, and family-based treatment research."
10903866,"Abstract
Unlike oocytes (and all somatic cells), which package their DNA with histones, the DNA of mature sperm is
bound by protamines, a highly basic and rapidly evolving protein that is essential for compaction of the paternal
genome. This differential packaging of egg and sperm DNA traces back >500 million years, yet our
understanding of the principles of genome organization remains poorly understood. To examine this fundamental
yet poorly understood process we have developed novel genetic and biophysical tools to identify proteins
implicated in the histone-to-protamine exchange and to dissect the molecular mechanisms of chromatin
reorganization during spermiogenesis. In preliminary studies we developed epitope-tagged protamine 1 and 2
mice and relevant reagents such as specific antibodies. Immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry has
identified multiple potential chromatin remodelers/chaperones, which we will functionally characterize in this
proposed study, both in vivo and in vitro. Since protamine packaging results in a super-condensed chromatin
state, which does not easily lend itself to mechanistic investigations in vivo, we have developed novel methods
to purify protamines from sperm to use in both in vitro DNA curtain assays and in vitro reconstitution assays of
the histone-to-protamine exchange process. The overall goal of this proposal is to apply our diverse suite of
genetic, molecular, and biophysical tools to gain mechanistic insights into normal sperm chromatin packaging,
which is essential for genome fidelity and reproductive fitness of the species."
10905018,"Abstract: The global obesity epidemic drives the high prevalence of cardiometabolic disorders (CMDs),
including type 2 diabetes (T2D), and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Epidemiological studies have
also established strong sex differences in CMDs. Obesity-induced low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance
in adipose tissue (AT), their deteriorating impacts on the efficacy of adipogenesis, and subsequent ectopic fat
storage into other cardiometabolic tissues, particularly liver, have been proposed as the key drivers of the CMD
risks related to obesity. However, the mechanisms promoting the transitions from health-to-disease states in
human fat depots have remained largely elusive. We hypothesize that there are transcriptional inflammatory
markers and cell-type-specific changes in open chromatin pertinent to health-to-CMD transitions that can be
discovered using single cell level and bulk omics analyses in fat cell-types and tissue. We also hypothesize that
by elucidating molecular responses to obesity-related stimuli during adipogenesis we can discover candidate
variants and genes with functional priors for formal identification of gene-sex and gene-environment interactions
(i.e. GxSs and GxEs) underlying obesity-induced health-to-CMD transitions in large biobanks. In Aim 1, we will
generate sex- and context-specific bulk and single cell level transcriptomics (RNA-seq) and epigenomics (ATAC-
seq) data in two obesity-relevant fat depots, i.e. subcutaneous and visceral AT, to identify epigenetic and
transcriptional markers for health-to-CMD transitions in six health-to-CMD stages comprising lean, overweight,
and obese males and females with and without prediabetes, T2D, and NAFLD. We will also use existing serum
samples to discover health-to-CMD transition biomarkers among the genes that differ between the six
health/disease states and encode secreted proteins. We will test the top results for replication in independent
omics cohorts, including Mexicans. In Aim 2, we will use a new function-to-variants omics approach to discover
GxSs and GxEs involved in early transitions from health to CMD in males and females. We will generate
functional genomics data in CMD-relevant human primary preadipocytes, extracted from fresh AT of normal
weight, metabolically healthy males and females. These preadipocytes will be differentiated with and without key
inflammatory stimuli to discover stimuli-responsive adipogenesis genes and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that
harbor regulatory variants in diverse populations. Subsequently, these variants will be fine-mapped using
massively parallel reporter assay in (pre)adipocytes and functionally characterized using extensive variant-to-
gene-linkage analysis and genomic perturbations (CRISPR and siRNA). The identified candidate SNPs will be
tested for GxE and GxS effects on health-to-CMD transitions in large biobanks to verify their role in these critical
transitions. Our preliminary results and ample previous experience with integrative multiomics approaches of
CMDs provide a strong prior scientific rigor for the proposed Aims, and overall, accomplishing our Aims has a
great potential to develop personalized strategies that prevent or postpone the onset of obesity-related CMDs."

 Clinical decision-making in subspecialties, like pediatric neuro-oncology, is becoming increasingly data-
driven and complex. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful tool that can help distill this expanding dataset to
present the clinician with the right information at the right time. AI has had little success in clinical applications
so far, but new methods (like OpenAI's DALL-E or GPT3 models) are now in the public eye, clearly demonstrating
the power of the technology generally. Effective translation of that technology into the clinical setting requires a
comprehensive understanding of the specific clinical setting, such as personnel/roles, data/technology used,
clinical goals and workflows. Human-Centered Design (HCD) is a solution framework that emphasizes the needs
of the people who perform a specific task and is well suited to facilitate the design of clinical AI. However, HCD
is challenging to execute in this space because it is difficult and expensive to assemble a team of experts that
spans clinical medicine, artificial intelligence, visualization, and social sciences. Academia and industry have
established multidisciplinary HCD/AI teams but are seeking solutions for filling interdisciplinary leadership roles
in these teams.
 I previously published a deep learning model for classifying pediatric suprasellar tumors from
preoperative MRI. My model performed as well as human experts on the same dataset (86%), which was also
congruent with previous studies on human expert performance on the task. In addition, pediatric suprasellar
tumors are almost always diagnosed via surgical pathology, with roughly 8% of patients being radiographically
diagnosed. Preliminary data (Aim 2) suggests that we can improve the deep learning model performance up to
95% by incorporating a Bayesian methodology to estimate model uncertainty. Additional preliminary data (Aim
3) indicates that embedding my model into Google's What-If Tool (WIT) can help clinicians radiographically
diagnose these tumors with less perceived difficulty and greater perceived confidence. Therefore, this proposal's
central hypothesis is that explainable AI solutions can improve human experts' pediatric suprasellar tumor
radiographic diagnosis beyond the current performance levels. Moreover, using an HCD approach, Google's
What-If Tool (WIT) can be adapted into the clinician's workflow in a manner that will result in adoption of this
assistive technology. I will investigate my aims, specifically designed to provide functional knowledge in these
topics to enable me to effectively lead a multidisciplinary team of subject-matter experts in developing robust
clinical AI tools. I am guided by an expert team of mentors representing pediatric neuro-oncology, neurosurgery,
AI, visualization, and HCD. Completion of this proposal will significantly contribute to my career goal: to be a
leader in the application of HCD to develop clinical AI technology that supports pediatric neuro-oncology patient
care."

Our goal is to reduce diagnostic and treatment errors, improve survival, and increase the value of care for lung
cancer patients by improving our ability to select patients who benefit from a pretreatment lymph node biopsy.
Accurately determining whether cancer has spread to lymph nodes and the extent of spread (a process called
nodal staging) is critical for appropriate treatment selection. Understaging can lead to omission of
chemotherapy or unnecessary surgery. Overstaging can lead to unnecessary chemotherapy and omission of
surgery. Diagnostic and treatment errors negatively impact survival. These errors commonly occur when using
imaging alone for nodal staging. A biopsy can reduce the chances of error, but it can also result in rare, life-
threatening adverse events. Each biopsy costs ~$5,000. Practice guidelines recommend selectively performing
a biopsy when imaging findings suggest nodal disease. However, national biopsy rates are less than half of
what they should be. Moreover, there is 25-fold facility-level variability not explained by access to care, case-
mix, or clinician or facility characteristics. These findings, along with the low levels of evidence underlying
guideline recommendations, suggest true clinical and scientific uncertainty over the indications for lymph node
biopsy. We conducted a pilot study to better understand how well guideline recommendations select patients
for biopsy and learned that guideline-concordant nodal staging selects all patients with true nodal disease for
biopsy and two-thirds of patients without true nodal disease for biopsy. Additionally, we developed and
validated an alternative risk-based nodal staging strategy that uses a prediction model to stratify and select
patients for lymph node biopsy. Preliminary data show that it identifies nearly all patients with true nodal
disease for biopsy but selects fewer patients without nodal true nodal disease for biopsy. However, the
relationship between selection strategies for lymph node biopsy and patient outcomes remains unknown. We
hypothesize that guideline-concordant nodal staging is associated with higher 5-year survival rates compared
with guideline-discordant nodal staging (Aim I) and that risk-based nodal staging is equivalent to guideline-
concordant nodal staging in terms of survival but superior in terms of lower biopsy-related adverse events and
healthcare expenditures (Aim II). Testing these hypotheses will require ~4,000 patients; therefore, a trial is not
feasible at this time. We will create a novel cohort of lung cancer patients using the Cancer Research Network
infrastructure to conduct Aim I using an observational, comparative-effectiveness study design with advanced
regression techniques and machine learning to minimize confounding. Additionally, we will use patient-level
data from this cohort as model inputs in a comparative-effectiveness simulation model that we will develop to
conduct Aim II. Findings from this study will lead to: 1) developing and testing implementation strategies
designed to increase guideline-concordant nodal staging, 2) alternative guideline recommendations for nodal
staging, and/or 3) justifying trials comparing outcomes between different nodal staging strategies."

Fidelity of the gene expression program, involving precise temporal and spatial regulation, is critical to cellular
function and organismal development. As such, perturbations or disruptions in the mechanisms governing gene
expression are often implicated in disease. Neurons appear particularly sensitive to disturbances in gene
expression with disruptions in RNA metabolism common in neurological diseases. For example, mutations in
various RNA binding proteins (RBPs) involved in nuclear mRNA processing and export are linked to
neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). One such complex with mutations in multiple subunits tied to NDDs is
the THO complex. THO is a highly conserved complex with diverse roles in transcription and mRNA processing,
with models suggesting it serves as an interaction hub for coordinating nuclear processing events. Despite these
connections to NDDs and centrality to mRNA metabolism, there is still much not known regarding the dynamics
of the THO complex and how disruptions in individual components impact gene expression. This knowledge gap
necessitates work characterizing the role of the THO complex in gene expression. The central hypothesis of the
work proposed here is that THO is critical to coordinating nuclear mRNA metabolism and disruptions in complex
function that include NDD-linked mutations
lead to altered dynamics of mRNA processing and gene expression
outcomes. To address this hypothesis, this project will investigate the dynamics of the THO complex and model
impacts of THO mutants in S. cerevisiae. Given the structural and functional conservation of the THO complex,
budding yeast is a powerful model system to address this hypothesis utilizing innovative methods that would be
extremely time intensive, expensive, and technically challenging in other systems. Specifically, this project
employs a novel live cell imaging approach which can track recruitment of RBPs to a transcriptionally active
locus over time. Utilizing this technique in combination with other approaches, THO function will be characterized
in Aim 1 by temporally characterizing co-transcriptional recruitment of RBPs to a transcriptionally active locus.
The outcome of these efforts will be a quantitative framework for recruitment of the THO complex relative to
other RBPs. In Aim 2, the impact of complete gene deletions and disease-linked THO mutants on co-
transcriptional RBP recruitment dynamics and global gene expression will be assessed. This will clarify the role
of THO subunits in mRNP assembly, identify how disruptions in THO subunits shape global gene expression,
and functionally characterize a subset of NDD associated point mutants. Completion of these aims will provide
models that can be used to generate informed hypotheses for mechanisms by which THO complex mutations
contribute to neurological disease. This information is expected to provide a critical foundation for advancing our
understanding of clinically identified mutations in RBPs associated with NDDs."

During infection, immune cells rely on communication to productively target and eliminate invading pathogens.
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are one key mediator of intercellular communication between immune cells. These
membrane-bound vesicles contain proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that represent the inflammatory state of a
given cell. Upon release, these EVs can fuse with other immune cells, establishing biochemical communication
between cells and amplifying the inflammatory response to augment pathogen clearance. Yersinia pestis is the
etiologic agent of the human disease known as plague. A hallmark of this disease is the sophisticated
suppression of the host immune system in a biphasic manner. During acute infection, Y. pestis utilizes its type 3
secretion system (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into host cells which disrupt signaling pathways essential for
bacterial clearance. Thus, acute infection is hallmarked by the maintenance of a non-inflammatory environment
in which the bacteria can proliferate without host intervention. The second stage of infection, the pro-
inflammatory phase, begins 36-48 hours post-infection, in which the host begins to successfully mount an
immune response against the pathogen. However, the bacterial load ultimately overwhelms the host delayed
responses, at which point the host may succumb to infection. Previous work has demonstrated that the
generation of this non-inflammatory environment during acute infection is essential for Y. pestis virulence. While
numerous studies have highlighted the importance of suppressing phagocytosis, exocytosis, and other
antibacterial responses, there is a gap in knowledge of how Y. pestis manipulates the EV response and how this
impacts intercellular communication. Preliminary studies suggest that Y. pestis can manipulate the proteins
packaged into EVs by neutrophils in vitro. These data support the hypothesis that Y. pestis disrupts EVs
production during infection to alter inflammation. The studies presented here will expand on our preliminary data
by delineating the in vivo EV response during pneumonic plague (Aim 1) and defining the impact of EVs on
immune modulation (Aim 2). These studies will be the first to investigate the role of EV-mediated intracellular
communication during plague. Therefore, completion of these aims will significantly improve our understanding
of how. Y. pestis exploits EV trafficking to manipulate the host immune response."

Sensory hypersensitivity is a common symptom in autism and Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and is thought to be a
result of cortical circuit dysregulation. EEG studies in humans with FXS and the FXS mouse model, the Fmr1
KO, reveal cortical circuit hyperexcitability and synchrony deficits such as enhanced resting state power in the
gamma band and reduced sensory-driven synchrony. In acute slices, this hyperexcitability can be observed as
prolonged persistent activity states, called UP states, and increased gamma band power during UP states. I
hypothesize that circuit mechanisms that mediate hyperexcitability and prolonged UP states in the neocortex
may contribute to EEG phenotypes in FXS. Using positive and negative allosteric modulators (PAMs/NAMs)
specific for GluN2C/D subunits of NMDA receptors, I have revealed an upregulation of GluN2C/D function in the
Fmr1 KO cortex that contributes to circuit hyperexcitability. Specifically, GluN2C/D PAMs increase UP state
duration and gamma power during the UP states, while NAMs rescue UP state duration. Remarkably, these
interventions only affected the Fmr1 KO, not their wildtype (WT) littermates suggesting that GluN2C/D function
is upregulated in the Fmr1 KO and leads to cortical circuit dysfunction. Typically, GluN2C/D subunits are
expressed in cortical inhibitory neurons and astrocytes. Since my results are not consistent with effects on
inhibitory neurons, GluN2C/D subunits may be misexpressed in excitatory neurons or upregulated in astrocytes
in the Fmr1 KO. I hypothesize that GluN2C/D expression and/or function is increased in excitatory
neurons and/or astrocytes in Fmr1 KO mice and this contributes to hyperexcitability and altered
synchrony of cortical circuits. The goal of the proposed project is to test this hypothesis and determine
expressional and functional changes in Glun2C/D that may contribute to cortical hyperexcitability and synchrony
following three Specific Aims. Aim 1. To determine change in cortical protein and RNA expression levels as well
as cell specific expression of GluN2C/D subunits in Fmr1 KO cortex. Aim 2. To determine cell specific functional
contribution of GluN2C/D subunits to NMDA-mediated currents in WT and Fmr1 KO cortex. Aim 3. To determine
the contribution of GluN2C/D NMDARs to in vivo sensory driven circuit excitability and altered synchrony using
multi-electrode array EEG and measurement of audiogenic seizures in the Fmr1 KO mouse in collaboration with
Dr. Devin Binder at UC Riverside. These experiments will not only provide insights into the molecular and cellular
basis of GluN2C/D contribution to cortical circuit dysfunction, but also examine GluN2C/D subunits as a potential
target for therapeutic development using translational biomarkers."

 Brain blood vessel cells play key roles in both physiological and pathological states.
Endothelial and mural cells compose the main structural and functional elements of the
vasculature. Mural cells, which lie outside of endothelial cells, are critical for the development of
the blood brain barrier and regulate blood flow in response to neuronal activity. However, most
studies of brain blood vessels use adult mice and therefore little is known about the developing
vasculature or human brain blood vessels at any age. These knowledge gaps preferentially affect
preterm infants, who are prone to develop hemorrhages specifically located in brain regions called
the ganglionic eminences (GE). These hemorrhages confer high risk for permanent brain injury,
and we have no treatments.
 To molecularly define the stages and subtypes of mural cells in the developing human
brain, I developed a Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) strategy followed by single cell
RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). These data revealed distinct stages of mural cell development
from a relatively immature stage at 15GW to the emergence of distinct subtypes at 23 GW.
Strikingly, this strategy also uncovered a novel progenitor population that express both mural and
neural stem cell markers, suggesting a common neurovascular progenitor that contributes to both
angiogenesis and neurogenesis. In the GE, immunohistochemistry with putative neurovascular
progenitor markers revealed these cells in a periventricular and perivascular location situated
amongst canonical neural stem cells. Consistent with these results, FACS-purified mural cells
produce both vascular and neural lineage cells in vitro. In sum, the above experiments lead me
to hypothesize that mural cells contribute to both angiogenesis and neurogenesis during
development and that a predominance of immature stages of mural cells in the GE
contributes to the pathogenesis of hemorrhage. My short-term goals for the proposed K08
are the following: 1. Construct an atlas of human brain mural cells during development using
scRNAseq and postmortem human tissue. 2. Develop organoid, mouse transplant, and CRISPR
tools to manipulate and interrogate the role of specific signaling pathways of mural cells in human
brain development. These results will propel me to an R01. As a physician scientist in Neonatal-
Perinatal Medicine, I am uniquely suited to advance our understanding of brain vascular
development and the application of this knowledge towards future therapy."

Rhythm is a critical feature of locomotion and is generated by interneurons in the spinal cord. The intrinsic and
local mechanisms employed by lumbar spinal rhythmogenic interneurons and how they are recruited by
supraspinal locomotor centers represent major gaps in our understanding of rhythmogenesis and locomotor
circuitry. This information is crucial in the pursuit of therapeutic targets to treat the leading causes of paralysis
including spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, and Parkinson’s Disease. Spinal interneurons expressing the
transcription factor Shox2 include a group of putatively rhythmogenic interneurons in the mouse. Shox2
interneurons in the adult lumbar spinal slice possess rhythmogenic ionic currents, including persistent inward
currents, and make functional excitatory connections to other Shox2 interneurons. We have found that a subset
of Shox2 interneurons in the adult lumbar spinal slice displays spontaneous rhythmic membrane potential
oscillations. Intrinsic and local network properties are essential for the initiation and maintenance of rhythmic
oscillations in other models of neuronal bursting and Shox2 interneurons in the spinal slice allow for the study of
the specific mechanisms involved in the adult mammalian locomotor circuitry. This proposal explores how
oscillations in Shox2 interneurons are generated and recruited using an innovative approach that combines
whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology, transsynaptic tract tracing, and optogenetics. With this combinatorial
approach, we will test the overarching hypothesis that Shox2 interneurons in the lumbar spinal cord of adult mice
display rhythmic firing that is critically mediated by persistent sodium current and local excitatory synaptic
connections and recruited by monosynaptic excitatory input from the lateral paragigantocellular nucleus in the
brainstem. In whole-cell patch clamp experiments, we will identify the voltage sensitive current(s) and underlying
voltage-gated ion channels critically involved in rhythmic oscillations in individual Shox2 interneurons.
Additionally, we will pharmacologically test the contributions of the local synaptic connections to oscillatory
properties in Shox2 INs in the lumbar spinal slice. Lastly, the supraspinal nuclei which monosynaptically project
to lumbar Shox2 interneurons will be identified by monosynaptic restricted transsynaptic tracing from Shox2
interneurons in the adult mouse. These anatomical projections will be functionally evaluated optogenetically in
the adult lumbar spinal slice. Together, this represents essential first steps in identifying and evaluating
mechanisms of rhythm generation in and recruitment of Shox2 interneurons which may serve as therapeutic
targets for the treatment of paralysis in which spinal locomotor circuits are left intact, but dormant."

Membrane fusion, mediated by HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein [Env; trimeric (gp160)3 cleaved to (gp120/gp41)3],
is the first critical step for the virus to enter host cells and establish infection. A mature Env spike contains
three copies each of noncovalently-associated receptor-binding subunit gp120 and fusion subunit gp41. A
general picture of viral membrane fusion has emerged from extensive biochemical and structural studies.
Sequential binding of gp120 to the primary receptor CD4 and a coreceptor leads to large, irreversible structural
rearrangements in gp41, which drive the membrane fusion process. Despite tremendous progress in our
understanding of the structure of HIV-1 Env over the last two decades, largely based on studies of its soluble
fragments, we still lack an atomic picture of the full-length Env in a membrane environment. In a series of
recent studies, we have determined the structures of the transmembrane domain, membrane proximal external
region, as well as a portion of the cytoplasmic tail of HIV-1 Env in bicelles that mimic lipid bilayers by NMR.
Unexpectedly, we find that these regions all form well-ordered trimeric clusters in the presence of a lipid bilayer
and that disruption of any of them reduces membrane fusion efficiency and alters the antigenic structure of the
entire Env, suggesting that they play critical structural and functional roles. These new findings provide a
strong scientific premise to determine the structure of the full-length HIV-1 Env reconstituted in lipid
nanodiscs by cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM). We hypothesize that the transmembrane and membrane-
proximal regions of HIV-1 Env all adopt defined oligomeric structures that are critical for the stability,
function and antigenicity of the full-length protein in membrane. We will capitalize on the recent advances
in cryoEM and nanodisc technology and plan to determine structures of the full-length Env proteins,
reconstituted in lipid bilayers, both alone or in complex with the matrix protein. Our goal is to visualize novel
structural features of the intact Env proteins in the context of membrane, to gain a full understanding of their
structure-function and to facilitate Env-based immunogen design for vaccine development. We will purse the
following specific aims: 1) we will determine the structure of a full-length HIV-1 Env in the context of
membrane, 2) we will determine the structural basis for antigenic differences of the intact Env in membrane
among HIV-1 isolates with different antibody sensitivity, and 3) we will determine the structure of a full-length
HIV-1 Env in complex with matrix protein."

 The human skin is the largest organ of the body. This physical barrier and the skin's innate immunity are
an essential first defense against pathogens. Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen and the
dominant microorganism of soft skin and tissue infections. These infections can quickly develop into systemic
infections and worsen health outcomes. Increasingly, antibiotic-resistant epidemic S. aureus strains (e.g.
methicillin-resistant S. aureus, MRSA) complicate treatment of these infections in the clinical setting.
 Although skin colonization increases risk of a MRSA infection, studying this aspect of host-pathogen
interactions has been challenging. Current animal models lack the acidity, skin structure, and eccrine gland
distribution of human skin and are not accessible to many research groups. Additionally, in vitro testing with
media mimicking the human skin surface have not been published. To address these gaps, I developed an in
vitro media that incorporates the metabolites, ions, and pH that MRSA would encounter on the human skin. I
performed RNA-seq of MRSA grown in these conditions and compared these results to a previous RNA-seq
experiment of MRSA inoculated on mouse skin. In both datasets, genes for metabolizing urea, derived from
sweat glands; and urocanic acid, derived from the natural moisturizing factor, were significantly upregulated. I
hypothesize that the metabolism of urea and urocanic acid contributes to S. aureus pH homeostasis and
growth, respectively, on the skin. This hypothesis will be tested in the following aims: Aim 1: Ascertain the
role of urease and related functions in MRSA growth and pH homeostasis in human skin-like in vitro models.
Genetic and biochemical approaches will be used in an in vitro media and a differentiated keratinocyte model to
investigate the role of urease, contribution of urea and nickel transport to urease function, and therapeutic
approaches to inhibit urease activity Aim 2: Investigate the role of urocanic acid metabolism in MRSA skin
colonization. Genetic and biochemical approaches will be used in the previously mentioned models to validate
the predicted encoded functions of this pathway, investigate substrate specificity of the pathway, and better
understand regulatory control. Epidemiology of pathway expression will be assessed by Western Blot analysis
of clinical S. aureus skin isolates from atopic dermatitis patients and healthy controls. These studies will
provide a foundation for future research of the skin microbiota, expand our understanding of MRSA
physiology on the skin, and identify potential targets for future therapeutic development."
10747935,"Postsynaptic Signaling by Norepinephrine and cAMP
Abstract
Norepinephrine (NE) regulates attention and alertness. The β2AR adrenergic receptor (β2AR) is the prevalent
postsynaptic NE effector at glutamatergic synapses, where it interacts with AMPARs and the postsynaptic L-
type Ca2+ channel (LTCC) CaV1.2. These complexes also contain all downstream effectors of β2AR (Gs, adenylyl
cyclases (ACs) and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase PKA) for highly localized signaling by cAMP (see our
pioneering work in Science 293, 98; Science 293, 2205; EMBO J 29, 482; EMBO J 35, 1330; Science
Signaling10, eaaf9659 and eaaf9647). Our exciting preliminary data indicate that 1) NE enters neurons and
endosomes via the NE transporters OCT3 and PMAT to stimulate intracellular β2AR signaling and drive AMPARs
to the cell surface; 2) the cAMP degrading phosphodiesterase PDE4A5, which is increased during sleep
deprivation and mediates the resulting memory impairment, is linked to the β2AR - AMPAR complex via PSD-
95; 3) CaV1.2 forms a supercomplex with AMPARs, which allows efficient activation of CaV1.2 during synaptic
transmission at postsynaptic sites with NE present. Aim 1 is to test whether activation of intracellular β2ARs upon
NE uptake by OCT3 & PMAT triggers AMPAR phosphorylation and surface delivery, thereby promoting LTP as
PKA is known to stimulate AMPAR surface insertion. We will test whether NE-induced phosphorylation
(immunoblotting; IB) and surface insertion of GluA1 (immunofluorescent microscopy; IF) and NE-dependent LTP
are abrogated by inhibitors and KO of OCT3 &PMAT. This will provide for the first time lacking but important
evidence for intracellular signaling by NE in neurons. Aim 2 is to test whether the cAMP-hydrolyzing PDE4A5
curbs upregulation of AMPARs by β2AR - cAMP - PKA signaling. We will test whether displacing PDE4A5 from
GluA1 with polypeptides elevates GluA1 phosphorylation by PKA and surface expression of GluA1 in HCs (IF)
and postsynaptic AMPARs responses (mEPSC, EPSC). Aim 3 is to determine the AMPAR - CaV1.2 interaction
sites and test the functional relevance of the AMPAR - CaV1.2 supercomplex formation. We will disrupt the
interaction by mutations and acute peptide application to determine its role in Ca2+ influx into dendritic spines
and GluA1 surface insertion by live imaging. This work will define unexplored fundamental molecular
mechanisms of how NE regulates postsynaptic functions. It will elucidate new molecular details that might be
affected in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, which is at least in part due to dysregulation of
CaV1.2 and glutamate receptors by β2AR signaling. NE signaling is also relevant for ADHD and PTSD. The
postsynaptic assembly of specific signaling components that control PKA-mediated phosphorylation of AMPARs
and CaV1.2 and their functional interactions constitute potentially effective and specific targets for drugs that
disrupt some of these interactions while not affecting others (e.g., our peptides DSPL and Pep2 that specifically
displace the β2AR from AMPAR but not CaV1.2 and vice versa, respectively EMBO J 35,1330).

10747938,"The fluid, seemingly effortless execution of sequences of movements is a ubiquitous feature of everyday motor
behavior. Ample evidence for the importance of this ability comes from the common human diseases
(Parkinson's disease, in particular) in which sequential skills are especially impaired. Long-term motor
sequencing skills are formed, most likely, through the cooperation of parallel cortical-sub-cortical circuits
involving associative, premotor, and motor regions of the brain. Recent evidence suggests that for each of these
brain circuits, the sub-cortical loop through the basal ganglia (BG) contributes selectively to reinforcement-driven
modulation of thalamo-cortical plasticity while cortex is well-suited as a site for long-term retention and efficient
recall of well-practiced skills. These findings lead to the hypotheses that BG loops play central roles in the
acquisition of sequence information whereas the anatomically-connected cortical areas are more important for
the storage and use of already-learned information. The specific aims (SAs) of this proposal will test that general
hypothesis by using non-human primates: (1) To determine if neurons in the globus pallidus interna (GPi, a
primary BG output nucleus) preferentially encode sequence task information during learning and the production
of recently learned sequences. Cortical neurons are predicted to not show a preference for recently learned
sequences. (2) To test if intact BG circuits are necessary primarily for the learning and production of recently-
learned sequences. Cortical circuits, in contrast, are predicted to be necessary even for well-learned sequences.
Associative loops through cortex and BG may play greater roles in the fast acquisition and flexible recall of goal-
directed sequence information. The premotor and motor loop circuits may mediate slow acquisition of habit-like
effector-specific representations. We will infer the circuit membership of individual GPi neurons by stimulating
different cortical areas and observing the orthodromic inhibitory effects. Animals will perform a discrete sequence
production task alternating in blocks between random, novel-to-familiar and over-trained sequences. SA1 will
test if neuronal encoding of task information in associative, premotor, and motor circuits reflects the predicted
divergent roles for BG- and cortical-components of these circuits. SA2 will determine if interruptions of BG output
(i.e., GPi inactivation or lesion) selectively impair the learning or recall of recently learned sequences.
Inactivations of cortex, in contrast, are predicted to also disrupt the recall of well-learned sequences. Results
from these experiments will aid in understanding the physiological basis for normal and impaired sequential
behavior in humans."
10747939,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Epilepsy can be a debilitating and sometimes fatal disease for which there are no preventatives, no
cure, and for which existing medications fail in one third of patients. Development of preventative treatments
for epilepsy is a key NINDS goal (Benchmark II. Prevent epilepsy and its progression; Galanopoulou et al.,
2016; Binder et al., 2020). The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway has emerged as a promising
target for epilepsy prevention. mTOR acts as a relatively ubiquitous promotor of cell growth; enhancing
neuronal connectivity, excitability and metabolism. Activation of the mTOR pathway occurs during
epileptogenesis and appears to regulate pro-excitatory changes implicated in the process. Moreover, blocking
mTOR signaling with the antagonist rapamycin mitigates epilepsy development in many epilepsy models.
Blocking mTOR signaling, however, does not work in all models, and there is evidence that this pathway may
also act to reduce brain excitability. To explain these conflicting effects, we hypothesize that increased mTOR
activation among excitatory neurons is pro-epileptogenic, while activation among GABAergic interneurons is
anti-epileptogenic. Systemic mTOR antagonists, therefore, block epileptogenic changes among excitatory
cells, but also block compensatory protective changes among interneurons. To test this hypothesis, we will use
intersectional genetic approaches to selectively delete the obligate mTOR regulatory proteins Raptor or Rictor
from vesicular GABA transporter-, parvalbumin-, and somatostatin-expressing interneurons in mice. We will
also examine the impact of enhancing mTOR signaling in interneurons by deleting the mTOR negative
regulator Tsc2. Studies will be conducted using both acquired and genetic models of epilepsy. We predict that
blocking mTOR signaling in interneurons will make epilepsy worse, while enhancing signaling will improve
outcomes. Studies will advance understanding of the role of mTOR in epileptogenesis and will have direct
implications for ongoing clinical use of mTOR antagonists."
10749005,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The immune system is arguably the second most complex human system after the brain. Its
proper response to foreign stimuli is governed by network-like interactions among various types
of cells and cytokines as their communication mediators. The complexity at the inter-cellular
level of the immune system is further exacerbated by the similarly complex biological and
biochemical networks within each cell (metabolism, gene regulation, etc.) responsible for the
dynamics and decision-making at the single-cell level. Such multiscale complexity makes it
incredibly challenging to understand the complete etiology and pathology of
immune-system-related diseases. My research program aims to identify how the immune
system can be rewired en masse to elicit higher-order decision-making while still enabling the
system to remain otherwise “healthy.” To this end, my research program is leveraging a highly
interdisciplinary research team (computational and experimental immunologists, software
engineers, and education researchers) and collaborators to build a Virtual Immune System -- a
multi-scale, multi-approach computational framework to understand better the complex
dynamical nature of the immune system, identify more accurate multi-dimensional biomarkers,
and identify safe and effective treatments within a reasonable time and cost. In the next five
years, in addition to expanding the Virtual Immune system, my program will continue to develop
methods and technologies for data-driven model construction, visualization, computation,
real-time simulations, and reproducibility to advance multi-scale modeling of the immune system
and beyond. We will continue to decipher the dynamics of the immune system under various
pathologies and the re-programmability of CD4+ T cells under the milieu of their
microenvironments. My laboratory will continue to iteratively predict, validate, and refine
predictions generated using the systems approaches and technologies. To do this, we will
generate our multi-omics data to more precisely validate immune system behaviors and apply
our findings to refine the computational approaches directly. My team will continue to build
collaborations and deepen our existing relationships, including with translational partners to
advance the impact of our systems work on drug discovery, the international team modeling
COVID-19, and with virologists and immunologists to further validate our computational
predictions experimentally."
10749006,"Project Summary / Abstract
We request NIH support to investigate how sensory hearing loss (SHL) is caused by chronic suppurative otitis
media (CSOM) or severe chronic middle ear infections. CSOM, a neglected tropical disease that afflicts 330
million people worldwide, is the most common cause of permanent hearing loss among children in the
developing world. It is characterized by a chronically discharging infected middle ear, and there is currently no
effective medical therapy or cure. The bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), is the leading culprit. PA
colonizes the middle ear via a hole in the tympanic membrane and establishes itself into a biofilm community,
complicating attempts to treat and fully eradicate infection. Over the course of the disease, the infection waxes
and wanes as the population of bacteria within the biofilm responds, in part, to immune attack or topical
antibiotics. This waxing and waning of bacterial infection leads to permanent sensory hearing loss via an
unknown mechanism. Our lab has recently created and validated a novel PA CSOM animal model that mimics
the human condition. Specifically, we create the infection by inoculating PA in the right state (phenotype) and
dose, which results in an infection that persists beyond six months, waxes and wanes upon topical
fluoroquinolone therapy, and leads to hair cell death, over time, like in the human disease. Previous
investigations by others relied on acute infection models based on non-PA bacteria. In contrast, our unique
model of PA CSOM now allows us to observe development of the infection in the inner ear and identify agents
and/or processes that may be causing the resulting sensory hearing loss. Our studies would help determine
whether permanent hearing loss is preventable in CSOM and, if so, guide strategies for therapeutic intervention.
Our Aims encompass: (1) determining the timing and nature of structural changes occurring within the cochlea
and assessing the macrophage distribution as these changes occur, (2) investigating potential direct hair cell
(HC) toxins and macrophage inducers through CSOM perilymph sampling, and (3) evaluating the contributions
of resident and migrating macrophages towards hair cell loss in CSOM by combining our CSOM mouse model
with the CD68-GFP transgenic reporter mouse and, separately, with a triple knockout mouse strain with
macrophages unable to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) while also evaluating whether NLRP3
inflammasome function is necessary for HC loss in the cochlea.
Altogether these aims are a completely new approach to sensory hearing loss caused by CSOM. If successful,
these studies will support future investigations into the mechanisms in the pathophysiology of CSOM and lead
to novel treatments for PA and potential strategies to prevent sensory hearing loss in CSOM."
10749007,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the most common cardiac procedure with over 650,000 PCI
performed annually in the U.S. Post-PCI complications which occur in a significant proportion of patients are
associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Reliable ascertainment of post-PCI events is
important for performance measurement, submission to disease registries, clinical trials, and for cardiac
catheterization laboratory (CCL) safety monitoring. Claims based detection of PCI complications is inadequate.
Assessing post-PCI events reliably requires an in-depth manual chart review, which incurs a significant
provider and administrative burden. However, with advances in health information technology and nationwide
adoption of electronic health record (EHR) systems, it possible to utilize EHR for the automatic derivation of
clinical events. Dr. Murugiah proposes to create and validate automated algorithms which can be applied to
EHR data to detect two important post-PCI events which are a common focus of clinical trials and quality
improvement efforts – in-hospital bleeding and 1-year target lesion revascularization (TLR). Using EHR data at
a large health system, Dr. Murugiah will develop a hybrid algorithm to detect major bleeding post-PCI by
leveraging structured data fields such as laboratory values, as well as unstructured data such as imaging
reports, cardiac catheterization reports, and progress notes incorporating Natural Language Processing (NLP)
techniques (Aim 1). Similarly, using cardiac catheterization reports for patients undergoing repeat
revascularization within 1 year, an algorithm will be developed to detect TLR (Aim 2). Both algorithms will be
externally validated using EHR data from another large institution. The final algorithm will be implemented into
a tool generating scheduled reports of bleeding and TLR, to be fed back to the quality assurance team for the
CCL and to individual operators. Individual operators will be surveyed to obtain feedback about the algorithm,
reporting process, and their perceived benefit. The final tools will be made open source (Aim 3). An automated
algorithm for the detection of post-PCI events within EHR can reduce administrative burden, enable the
generation of new knowledge from EHR based observational studies, and enable pragmatic clinical trials.
Further, this project can serve as a proof of concept of the utility of hybrid tools leveraging both structured data
and clinical text for surveillance and quality measurement. Dr. Murugiah has a career interest in studying and
improving the treatment for ischemic heart disease using multidimensional datasets and EHR data to develop
real time risk prediction models and decision support tools, and conduct EHR based comparative effectiveness
studies and clinical trials. During the award period he will leverage the experience of his mentorship team
which includes national experts in cardiovascular outcomes research, clinical informatics, and computational
linguistics. He will also acquire formal training in clinical informatics by completing a Master of Health Science
degree which will provide him the necessary platform to make the transition into an independent investigator."

Pregnant and lactating people remain therapeutic orphans as they are excluded from the vast majority of
clinical drug development and therapeutic trials. Moreover, current practices in drug evaluation in pregnancy
have been hindered by the lack of effective biomarkers and innovative study designs. There is a need to
develop novel placental-specific biomarkers in order to assess placental function and response to therapeutics,
as a way to inform on their safety and efficacy. An example of these novel biomarkers is placental (fetal)
specific extracellular vesicles (EVs). Recent advances in characterizing the cargo content of these EVs
demonstrated their potential to be used as placental biomarkers. We have shown using funding support from
the MPRINT that fourteen proteins found in EVs significantly correlated with aspirin use (FDR<0.1) in at-risk
people, but that more power is needed to confidently assess the relationship with aspirin dosage and
pregnancy outcomes. In addition, prior studies showed that aspirin affects endothelial and trophoblast cells,
thus potentially modulating exosome derived from these cells and their cargo contents. Leveraging our prior
proof of principle success, previously collected, and ongoing collection of maternal plasma from people at-risk
of preeclampsia (PE) receiving 81mg or 162mg of aspirin daily and low-risk people at the Ohio State
University, we are submitting this application with the overarching goal to develop a novel platform to augment
the MPRINT resources using exosome profiling, as novel biomarkers, to monitor placental mediated adverse
pregnancy outcomes and response to therapeutics. For this, we will use PE as a hallmark of these outcomes
and aspirin as the therapeutic agent to show case the utility of the platform. In this study, we will test the
hypothesis that differential expression of EVs proteome cargo is associated with placental and pregnancy
health in response to aspirin treatment at different gestational periods. We will test the following specific aims:
1) Validate our preliminary proteome data and model using larger cohort from additional biobanked samples of
at-risk people receiving 81mg or 162 mg aspirin, characterize fetal specific EVs (placental alkaline
phosphatase [PLAP] +ve) isolated from maternal plasma, and determine the differences in between the
maternal vs. fetal EV cargo difference with aspirin treatment; and 2) Determine the changes associated with
EV proteome profile (maternal and fetal) in at-risk people receiving aspirin prospectively and correlate with
clinical outcomes (development of PE) and angiogenic and inflammatory biomarkers associated with PE. This
project has the potential to play a seminal role in the development of a novel platform for therapeutics research
in pregnancy. This translational research platform will substantially add to the MPRINT Network repertoire and
be available for scientific community through the already established relationship of the team with other
networks such as the Maternal Fetal Medicine Units Network, MPRINT, and the Foundation of the NIH."

SF3B1 is the most commonly mutated splicing factor in cancer, occurring in thousands of cancer patients
annually. Mutations in SF3B1 result in a neomorphic protein that causes aberrant splicing of hundreds of
transcripts, including known cancer associated genes. While the mechanisms by which these alterations promote
tumorigenesis are incompletely understood, our lab has previously shown SF3B1 mutations are attractive
therapeutic targets. SF3B1 mutations are prevalent in many cancers (breast, melanoma, bladder, pancreatic,
leukemias), so improving our ability to target these mutations could have major public health implications. To do
this, there is a fundamental need to better understand how SF3B1 mutations drive tumorigenesis. Recent work
in acute myeloid leukemia shows differences in missplicing, oncogenic effects and prognosis among various
SF3B1 hotspot mutations, yet there are no studies to date investigating these in solid malignancies. To determine
potential therapeutic strategies, novel model systems are required. An innovative genome editing approach will
allow us to study the mutations at the most common hotspots from breast cancer and melanoma, K700 and
R625, respectively in several representative cell line models. Changes in the transcriptome and phenotypic
differences in proliferation, migration, and invasion will determine whether there are specific alterations in
SF3B1 that lead to distinct oncogenic phenotypes. Additionally, preliminary systematic analysis of online
cancer databases shows SF3B1 mutations and TP53 alterations are mutually exclusive in cancer. This often
suggests either synthetic lethality or a lack of selection for co-occurrence due to shared roles in tumorigenesis.
Successful generation of dual SF3B1 mutant and TP53 mutant or TP53 knock out cell lines demonstrates that
the mutations are unlikely to be synthetic lethal. Instead, this relationship likely demonstrates a shared role
and will allow us to determine novel mechanisms of SF3B1-mediated tumorigenesis. Previous findings in
SF3B1 mutants demonstrate dysfunctional cellular respiration due to missplicing and degradation of a UQCC1,
a component of mitochondrial complex III. There is a resultant increase in glucose, similar to p53’s well known
role in promoting the Warburg effect. Further studying the relationship between mutant SF3B1 and TP53 may
identify therapeutic vulnerabilities that can be additionally leveraged against the large subset of cancers with
TP53 mutations. The sponsor’s robust history of utilizing genome editing strategies to study individual mutations
in breast cancer in conjunction with the abundant resources and core facilities at Vanderbilt University make
these Aims achievable. Completion of these aims provide an excellent foundation in cancer molecular genetics.
This will allow the PI to acquire the technical skills to build toward an independent investigational career in
oncology, specifically studying novel pathologic features of cancers that lead to uniquely targetable
vulnerabilities."

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma accounting for
about 32,000 new cases per year and leading to death in over 40% of cases. This proposal seeks to
investigate the biological significance of KLHL6, a gene mutated in mature B-cell cancers, with DLBCL
displaying the highest rate of mutations. KLHL6 assembles into a functional CULLIN-RING Ubiquitin ligase
(CRL) complex and cancer-associated mutations inhibit KLHL6 interaction to CULLIN3, resulting in loss of
activity to transfer ubiquitin chains. In this proposal, we investigate KLHL6 as a master regulator and tumor
suppressor of the NOTCH signaling. An investigation of the cell autonomous and drug resistance in murine
model of DLBCL as well as patient derived DLBLC xenotransplants will be pursed. Building up on our data,
the central hypothesis of this proposal is that deregulation of the KLHL6 function is crucial to lymphomagenesis
and impacts therapy. Thus, we aim in modeling loss of Khll6 in a mouse model of DLBCL (Aim1) and we will
study how impairment of the NOTCH pathway impacts the therapeutic efficacy of B-cell receptor inhibition in
DLBCL (Aim2). Overall, this proposal investigates the mechanisms of DLBCL pathogenesis and treatment. The
clinical success of proteasome inhibitors, bortezomib, and E3 ubiquitin ligase glues for the treatment of
hematologic diseases has made the Ubiquitin pathway a bona fide target for cancer therapeutics. Thus,
defining how novel E3 ligases function at a molecular level and investigating their role in inflammation is critical
in order to develop more specific therapeutic avenues."
10841624,"Project Summary Genetic deletion (haploinsufficiency) or duplication events are often associated with a variety
of diseases, including: cancers, cardiovascular and metabolic disease, and neuropathies. Because many genes
are sensitive to both over- and under-expression, with imbalances in gene product in either direction leading to
disease, tight regulatory control is a therapeutic necessity. RNA-targeting technologies, however, provide a
mechanism to appropriately and reversibly modulate gene expression at the transcript level, resulting in tunable,
cell-specific remediation of disease-causing shifts in gene dosage. Our recently developed CRISPR- Cas-
inspired RNA targeting system (CIRTS), integrates small, human-derived proteins and guide RNA into an easily
programmed and packaged technology for tunable gene expression manipulation at the transcript level.
Notably, CIRTS imparts a major clinical advantage over that of functionally-related, but bacteria-derived
CRISPR/Cas systems: minimized immunogenic risk stemming from the use of human protein parts. This
proposal seeks to use protein engineering and cell-based screens to create highly efficient, optimized CIRTS-
based technologies – both for gene activation and deactivation – and assess their generality across a panel of
disease-relevant targets, and to test the potential of the technology in vivo. Initial screening will focus on the
gene PMP22, an exemplar gene for which both over- and under-activation result in distinct, but related, genetic
disorders. This provides a fertile testbed for optimization of both CIRTS degraders (Aim 1) and activators (Aim
2). In Aim 1, the human proteome will be mined to identify and characterize functional domains that can be
integrated into CIRTS to programmably degrade PMP22 RNA. How target RNA landing sites correlate with the
functional outcomes of each successful design, as well as generality against another target, SNCA, will be
simultaneously pursued. Aim 2 of the proposal focuses on developing CIRTS activators, mining the human
proteome for novel functional domains and using novel reporter systems to efficiently screen and characterize
them, and finally, assessing lead designs in two other target genes, SCN1a (brain) and JAG1 (liver). Aim 3 will
assess selectivity and specificity constraints of the system, and the generality of the CIRTS technology across a
range of biological contexts. Here, lead CIRTS architectures will be benchmarked against state-of-the-art
Cas13-based systems, comparing immunogenicity in vivo and testing the efficacy of CIRTS-based regulatory
systems in “real world” contexts, namely mouse models of PMP22-based gene dosing disorders. Critically, data
from all three aims feed off of and inform one another, resulting in a tripartite design-build-test optimization
cycle. Completion of this project will generate a multi-modal, programmable CIRTS toolkit for the manipulation
of gene expression at the RNA level. In addition to providing proof-of-principle validation of this system’s
potential in one exemplar clinical application, this work will also produce a unique suite RNA-targeting effectors
with broad utility across a wide variety of biomedical research and synthetic biology fields."

The basal amygdala (BA) has been shown to be involved in valence-specific behaviors, including fear learning
and reward behaviors. These behaviors are linked not only to genetic, anatomical, morphological, and
electrophysiological characteristics of the BA, but also the various inputs and outputs of the BA. Current research
has revealed the presence of four novel projection-defined subregions within the BA, each with unique brain
connections that can underlie their function. Understanding learning and memory associated with the BA is
especially important considering how dysregulation of tightly regulated emotional behaviors and associations
can contribute to anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Therefore, understanding how information flows through the
BA and its subregions along with the involvement of neuronal projections coming in and out of the BA is
necessary to understand these disorders.
This proposal combines brain-wide activity mapping along with in vivo calcium activity recording and neuronal
manipulation to test the role of projection-defined BA subregions in the retrieval of fear and fear extinction
memories. Recent advances in the characterization of BA regional connectivity will be employed to examine
neuronal activity within each of the four BA subregions’ connectomes using a mouse model that can label active
neurons brain-wide (Aim 1A). Next, retrogradely labeled subpopulations unique for each of the four BA
subregions will be subjected to in vivo calcium activity recordings (Aim 1B) and optogenetic manipulations (Aim
2). Collectively, these aims will provide information on the correlative activity of direct inputs and outputs into and
stemming from each BA subregion, activity of each BA subregion in valence-specific behaviors with particular
attention to fear and extinction memories, and possible causal contributions of each BA subregion neuronal
activity to fear and extinction memory expression.
For successful completion of this project, the applicant will be thoroughly trained in brain-wide imaging of
neuronal activity, fiber photometry, and optogenetic manipulations. In addition, the applicant will be provided with
numerous opportunities for training in science communication, mentorship, and career exploration. The Reijmers
and Maguire labs at Tufts University foster an environment where the applicant will be intellectually engaged and
supported with all necessary facility, equipment, and guiding to ensure productive graduate training, and to
prepare the applicant for a flourishing career as an independent researcher in neuroscience."

Crohn’s Disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease which leads to chronic inflammation and scarring of the
digestive tract. The available treatments involve immunosuppressants and surgery which are costly, with many
individuals still experiencing a decreased quality of life. The cause of CD is unknown, but is believed to occur
due to both genetic and environmental factors, including diet. The gut microbiome is altered in individuals with
CD, leading to dysregulation of the host and microbial transcriptional and metabolic landscape. Furthermore,
many genetic risk variants associated with CD are in host genes known to function in host response to the
microbiome. Thus, characterizing host-microbiome interactions in CD is imperative for understanding the
pathogenesis of CD and identifying potential new therapeutic routes. In this proposed research, I aim to
characterize the interactions between host genetic variation and the gut microbiome that regulate host gene
expression in CD. I will use two complementary approaches. I will use a microbiome/intestinal organoids
co-culturing approach to identify host gene expression changes in response to CD-derived microbiomes, and
host genetic variants that modulate these changes using allele-specific expression analysis. I will also utilize
data available through the Human Microbiome Project Inflammatory Bowel Disease Multi’omics Database to
perform eQTL mapping, and integrate all of my findings with GWAS and TWAS to validate the significance of
GxM for CD risk. These studies will provide insight into host-microbiome interactions that modify genetic risk
for Crohn’s Disease. Furthermore, I will identify specific microbes that could become potential therapeutic
targets for CD."
10866594,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neuronal Kv7/KCNQ channels are homotetramers of Kv7.2 and heterotetramers of Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 that are
highly expressed in the cortex and hippocampus, key brain regions for seizure, cognition and behavior. They
produce voltage-dependent outward K+ current (IM) which potently suppresses neuronal excitability. Dominant
mutations in Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 cause early-onset epileptic encephalopathy (EE) with severe cognitive and
behavioral deficits, stressing a critical need to understand how EE variants dysregulate Kv7 channels. Our
published studies show that Kv7 channels are preferentially enriched at the axonal plasma membrane via
calmodulin (CaM) binding to intracellular helices A and B of Kv7.2, which mediates their trafficking from the
endoplasmic reticulum to the axonal surface. Epilepsy variants in these helices reduce their axonal enrichment
and seizures in mice, underscoring the key role of axonal Kv7 channels in excitability. Importantly, membrane
lipid PIP2 is an essential cofactor for opening Kv7 channels as they are potently inhibited by its membrane
depletion. However, the PIP2 binding residues that regulate neuronal Kv7 channels in different states (open or
closed) and complex (homomers, heteromers, or CaM-bound) are unknown. Our recent work has revealed
that the PIP2-binding residues in open Kv7.2 channels are different from those in closed state and CaM-bound
open channels, and that select EE mutations of these sites induce both loss and gain of PIP2 sensitivity, and
reduce their axonal enrichment. Thus, the PIP2-binding landscape is dynamic and may regulate both function
and trafficking of Kv7 channels. The goals of this project are to identify (i) dynamic changes in PIP2 binding
residues of neuronal Kv7 channels that control their axonal enrichment and function, (ii) mechanisms by which
EE variants disrupt this modulation, and (iii) compounds that reverse this dysregulation. Our central
hypothesis is that dynamic and coordinated binding of PIP2 and CaM regulates activation and trafficking of
axonal Kv7 channels, whereas EE mutations increase neuronal excitability by impairing formation of this
complex. To test this, the present project will execute 3 specific aims using interdisciplinary approach
including molecular dynamic simulations, biochemistry, imaging, and electrophysiology. Aim 1 will identify PIP2
binding residues in CaM-bound and unbound Kv7 channels and test if their PIP2 binding and sensitivity are
regulated by EE mutations, Kv7 agonists and PIP2 mimetic compounds. Aim 2 will identify how PIP2 binding
modulates axonal surface enrichment of CaM-bound and unbound Kv7 channels by examining their exocytosis,
endocytosis, and plasma membrane retention. Aim 3 will test if loss- and gain-of PIP2 modulations of axonal
Kv7 channels lead to neuronal hyperexcitability in culture and conditional knock-in mice. In contrast to a well-
established role of PIP2 in gating modulation of Kv7 channels, this project will provide novel concepts that their
PIP2 binding sites change dynamically and modulate both function and trafficking of axonal Kv7 channels to
impact IM and neuronal excitability, and reveal novel pathogenic mechanisms of EE variants in Kv7.2 and Kv7.3."

support and cohesion, prenatal health behaviors (diet, physical activity, sleep, substance use), pregnancy
complications and birth outcomes, and child health outcomes for a socio-demographically heterogenous,
national sample. Geocoding efforts also enable the consideration of area level measures of structural racism,
allowing for multi-level, multi-domain analyses in line with the NIMHD research framework for investigating
health disparities. We seek to extend follow-up of our Atlanta ECHO Cohort participants under the ECHO
Protocol and to participate in solution-oriented team science. Enrolled children are now 2 to 7 years old and will
be followed with annual visits consistent with the ECHO Protocol, with a focus on child neurodevelopment as a
specialized outcome area. The unique contributions of our Cohort Study site include our capacity to follow
hard-to-reach racial and ethnic minority families (as our cohort is wholly composed of Black American families,
75% of whom are of lower socioeconomic status); our geographic location in a major metropolitan area in the
US Southeast that experiences unique regional and area-level stressors (e.g., racialized segregation); and our
multi-disciplinary team of psychosocial, clinical, and omic investigators with expertise in (personalized)
exposure assessment, maternal stress, perinatal and birth outcomes, and child neurodevelopment. Given our
team’s expertise, and preliminary data that supports an association between stress, omics pathways, and
neurodevelopment, we plan to lead test novel hypotheses about how prenatal stress (including racial
discrimination) leads to perturbations in the metabolome, epigenome and microbiome, and how these
biological perturbations, in turn, predict child neurodevelopment. We will also test the role of racial
discrimination experiences in children’s health outcomes in the ECHO cohort, as well as modifiable mediators
(maternal prenatal sleep quality and postpartum depression) and moderators (social support) which will inform
potential intervention strategies designed to improve children’s health outcomes."

Prenatal exposure to neurotoxic chemicals can have long-lasting effects on child neurobehavioral outcomes.
The majority of published studies focus on isolated exposure-outcome associations, ignoring the potential for
synergistic effects of multiple exposures on a broad range of neurobehavioral outcomes and failing to identify
mechanisms of action and targets for intervention. The proposed study, Mediators and Modifiers of Prenatal
Environmental Exposures and Child Neurodevelopment: DNA methylation, Prenatal Diet, and Cognitive
Stimulation study (MEND), addresses these gaps, leveraging extant and prospective data collected in the NIH
Environmental Influences on Child Outcomes project to study the effects of phthalates and organophosphate
flame retardants (OPFRs) on child neurobehavior. These compounds are of particular importance both
because they are ubiquitous in the environment and because they are believed to exert neurotoxicity through
shared mechanisms (e.g., oxidative stress, DNA methylation). Our study will continue the PATHWAYS-GAPPS
(PWG) cohort, a diverse sample of over 650 participants recruited from rural and urban communities in
Washington state with rich prenatal and longitudinal data. Our long-term goals are to identify mechanisms of
neurotoxic exposure and actionable targets for intervention that could attenuate the effects of those exposures.
We propose the following: Aim 1. Examine the relationship between prenatal exposure to phthalates and
OPFRs, cord blood DNA methylation, and child neurobehavior and assess prenatal dietary oxidative balance
as a potential modifier. Aim 2 (a) Use machine learning to develop multi-outcome phenotypic profiles of child
neurobehavior; (b) Employ these profiles to examine the relationships between prenatal phthalates and
OPFRs, cord blood DNA methylation, prenatal dietary oxidative balance, and child neurobehavior; (c) Explore
whether parental cognitive stimulation modifies the relationship between prenatal phthalates and OPFRs and
child neurobehavioral outcomes, including established constructs and novel phenotypic profiles. Aim 3. (a)
Retain a diverse sample of participants using tailored strategies such as sharing ECHO-wide and individual
results and (b) implement the ECHO protocol with high fidelity. Our team has the complementary expertise to
carry out these ambitious aims. Consistent with the NIH/ECHO mission to enhance diverse perspectives, our
team includes four under-represented minorities and a mix of junior investigators and senior investigators with
a strong track record of research mentorship. The"
10917286,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Consistent with the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease theory, prenatal stress can have
enduring effects on offspring health and may be a major pathway through which stress-related health problems
are transmitted across generations. This transmission of risk disproportionately impacts marginalized groups,
such as people of color and families living in under-resourced communities who experience lifelong inequities in
social determinants of health (e.g., discrimination, access to healthcare, neighborhood violence). Strengths-
based models are lacking in prenatal research, and there is limited understanding of resilience-promoting factors
that may buffer the impact of chronic stress exposure on maternal stress responsive systems and placental
function. Research conducted via our current ECHO award has contributed to evidence supporting the
preconception period as an important window of vulnerability to the effects of stressors on maternal and child
health. In this renewal, we leverage ECHO data to examine the extent to which nutritional status and social
support/connectedness attenuate the negative effects of stressors on child neurodevelopment across racially
and socioeconomically diverse groups. Our ECHO Cohort will continue to enroll participants from the ongoing,
longitudinal Pittsburgh Girls Study (PGS), an urban-population sample of 2,450 women (now ages 26-29) who
have been followed since childhood. PGS participants (n=568, 69% Black, 27% White, 4% multi-racial) have
been enrolled into the ECHO Study as they become pregnant; a further 609 individuals will be recruited in the
renewal period, yielding a total Cohort of 1,177. Extensive preconception data are available from the PGS for all
existing and future ECHO participants. Guided by our Community Stakeholder Partner Board, we will implement
the ECHO Protocol with high fidelity, and propose innovative, specialized measures of prenatal stress exposure
(i.e., maternal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning and placental CRH) and child executive function
and stress reactivity that can be readily deployed across ECHO Cohort sites. Thus, in response to RFA-OD-22-
018, we will advance the development, production, and dissemination of ECHO Cohort solution-oriented
collaborative science with the following Specific Aims: 1) Elucidate health and contextual factors that attenuate
the impact of prenatal stress exposure on child neurodevelopment; 2) Examine associations between stress
exposure, prenatal stress reactivity and offspring neurodevelopment; 3) Maximize participant retention, ensure
sample diversity and implement the ECHO protocol with high fidelity; and 4) Explore the timing and cumulative
effects of stress exposure on child health outcome. Our diverse, multidisciplinary team, representing wide
ranging identities, backgrounds and perspectives, has expertise in every aspect of the proposed study and is
highly qualified to lead collaborative cohort science in the renewal phase of the ECHO project. Achieving the
stated aims of the proposed study will advance knowledge on specific, measurable targets for tailored
approaches to the prevention of neurodevelopmental problems in children, including those at highest risk."
10917312,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Asthma is a complex, heterogenous condition with both genetic and environmental factors contributing to
disease. The epithelial barrier is the interface between environmental exposures and the host. Gene-
environment interaction studies demonstrate that early life exposures modify genetic risks in asthma, and
epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation (DNAm) may mediate these effects. Additionally, epithelial
transcriptional changes link to childhood asthma. We propose to use both of these powerful technologies to
provide a mechanistic link from environmental exposure to asthma inception. We hypothesize that exposures
at the epithelial barrier related to the community (air pollution, nearby green space) and the individual
(microbiome) alter epithelial DNAm and transcriptional responses to promote the development of asthma. To
evaluate this hypothesis, we will leverage the ECHO Cohort protocol 3.0 to determine how prenatal and early
life individual and neighborhood level exposures contribute to nasal epithelial changes in infancy to promote
the development of wheezing (aim 1), determine how the these exposures, including the skin microbiome,
influence skin epithelial changes to promote atopic dermatitis and wheezing (aim 2), and elucidate how
individual and neighborhood characteristics influence maternal nasal epigenetic changes throughout
pregnancy, and how these changes relate to allergic diseases in the child (aim 4). Finally, we will follow
existing ECHO participants and recruit 350 pregnant women and 50 women preconception that give birth (for a
of total 400 births) into ECHO Cohort protocol 3.0 (aim 3). Importantly, throughout this proposal, we seek to
disentangle factors that may underlie health disparities by identifying the mechanisms by which environmental
exposures (that are often associated and conflated with race) cause asthma. We will identify precise molecular
targets for diagnosis and prevention. This information can be used to (1) establish non-invasive biomarkers
(from nasal or skin swabs) to identify infants at risk for asthma, (2) develop treatment strategies based on
altering patterns of microbial colonization or epithelial gene expression to promote health, and (3) identify
actionable exposures that underly health disparities for intervention."

 Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects an estimated 37 million people in the United States.
CKD progression involves activation of inflammatory and fibrotic responses leading to irreversible
damage and loss of kidney function. The (pro)renin receptor (PRR) is implicated in the
pathogenesis of CKD and can exist as the full length form, bound to cell membrane or be cleaved
to generate a soluble PRR (sPRR) and M8.9 fragments. Although the function of the full-length
PRR both at a molecular and system level has been studied to some extent, the pathophysiologic
role of sPRR in CKD is unknown. This is especially important, since elevated plasma sPRR levels
have been described in patients with CKD and correlates with the stage of CKD. We recently
developed a novel mouse model with absence of sPRR using CRISPR-Cas9 directed
mutagenesis of the PRR cleavage site. Preliminary analyses show mutant sPRR mice have
reduced renal injury, inflammation and fibrosis compared to control mice and may involve
inflammatory signaling and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. The following specific aims will
be addressed:
 1. Investigate the pathophysiological role of sPRR in kidney disease. CKD will be induced in
 control and mutant sPRR mice using adenine diet or unilateral ureteral obstruction. Renal
 function, tubular injury, inflammation and fibrosis will be examined in conjunction with
 targeted comparative transcriptomics to identify active signaling pathways.
 2. Investigate the cellular mechanisms by which sPRR modulates kidney injury. sPRR
 regulation of inflammatory signaling pathways and oxidative phosphorylation and
 mitochondrial function will be examined in primary proximal tubule cell culture from control
 and mutant sPRR mice in presence of adenine or TGF-. Recombinant sPRR will be added
 to control and mutant cells lacking sPRR to examine if restoring sPRR levels reverses the
 renoprotective effects.
 3. Investigate the molecular interaction partners of sPRR. How sPRR mediates intracellular
 cell signaling will be examine by identifying protein-protein interactors through structure-
 guided affinity purification and mass-spectrometry and enzyme catalyzed proximity labeling
 in HEK293 cells. Mass spectrometry and proteomics analyses will delineate sPRR protein
 interaction and signaling under physiological conditions and in kidney disease.
 This proposal examines a novel modulator of kidney injury and fibrosis and will delineate the
mechanisms involved in mediating these effects. The integrative approach used herein will
identify systemic and molecular effects of sPRR in fibrosis and may help in the development of a
new therapeutic approach for CKD."

Seizures have both local and remote effects on nervous system function. Temporal lobe epilepsy is a common
and debilitating neurological disorder, characterized by focal seizures arising from limbic structures, including
the hippocampus. Interestingly, focal temporal lobe seizures often cause functional deficits such as impaired
consciousness, which is not expected from local hippocampal impairment alone. Human focal temporal lobe
seizures with impaired consciousness show slow waves on electro-encephalography (EEG) and decreased
cerebral blood flow in the neocortex, distant from the hippocampus. The mechanisms by which focal seizures
in the hippocampus cause depressed function in the neocortex are not known. Our previous work in a rat
model with focal limbic seizures reproduced the human findings and suggested that decreased subcortical
arousal produces impaired consciousness during seizures. Importantly, neurostimulation of subcortical arousal
systems was capable of restoring cortical function and behavioral responses during seizures, offering hope for
restored arousal in human epilepsy. Therefore, our central hypothesis is that focal limbic seizures decrease
subcortical arousal, causing cortical slow waves and impaired consciousness. However, the fundamental
mechanisms of these changes have not been determined. We recently developed a novel awake head-fixed
mouse model of focal limbic seizures, providing unique opportunities to investigate network, neurotransmitter
and neuronal mechanisms in relation to behavior. We found that both increased inhibition and decreased
excitation may contribute in parallel to depressed subcortical arousal in limbic seizures. In addition, depressed
arousal in multiple neurotransmitter systems may contribute to impaired cortical function. We now plan to
capitalize on strengths of the awake mouse model to employ techniques including high field fMRI, genetically
encoded fluorescent neurotransmitter sensors, optogenetics, single cell electrophysiology and behavioral
testing to fully investigate the mechanisms of impaired arousal in seizures. Therefore, our aims are to first
investigate the network mechanisms of impaired arousal in focal limbic seizures in the awake mouse model.
We will map cortical and subcortical networks by fMRI, followed by direct electrophysiological recordings,
stimulation and disconnection experiments to identify key network nodes. Second, we will analyze the
neurotransmitter changes in depressed cortical function. We will use genetically encoded fluorescent indicators
and optogenetics to determine the roles of increased inhibition and decreased excitation in depressed
subcortical arousal; and will investigate which arousal neurotransmitters contribute to impaired cortical function
and behavior. Third, we will relate the activity of single neurons to behavior in focal limbic seizures, using
juxtacellular recordings of identified subcortical arousal neurons and whole cell recordings of cortical neurons.
The integration of information across these levels in the awake model will have important translational value to
guide development of new treatments aimed at restoring consciousness during and following seizures."
10908660,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders diagnosed in
childhood, with a prevalence of 2% or higher. ASD presents along a spectrum, and characterization according
to quantitative measures demonstrates continuous distribution of core traits extending into the general
population. While both ASD diagnosis and ASD-related traits have been shown to be highly heritable, evidence
also supports contributions of environmental risk factors, including prenatal exposure to air pollution and intake
of certain nutrients. In order to address prior gaps in the understanding of environmental risk factors for autism,
our team developed the Autism Spectrum Disorder Enriched Risk (ASD-ER) “cohort of cohorts.” In the first phase
of ECHO, our cohort contributed to harmonization efforts of diet, air pollution, and neurodevelopment, and
advanced use of abbreviated measures of the ASD-related phenotype, while capitalizing on the unique data for
autism research presented by ECHO. Here, we propose to build off of these efforts while continuing follow-up of
ASD-ER ECHO Phase-1 children through the critical and under-studied period of adolescence and early
adulthood in the Trajectories and Environments in Autism: a Multi-cohort Study (TEAMS) project. The goals of
this project are to: 1) Examine joint effects of early life air pollution exposure and diet on
neurodevelopmental outcomes in ECHO-wide data, addressing the role that folate, fish/fatty acids, and other
dietary factors may play in mitigating air pollution associations across neurodevelopmental diagnoses and their
related quantitative traits (ASD, ID, and ADHD); 2) Evaluate multi-domain health trajectories of adolescents
across neurodevelopmental outcomes in ECHO-wide data, and identify predictors of positive trajectories
and outcomes. Using the unique longitudinal data collected through ECHO efforts, we will examine trajectories
across mental and physical health and examine how these differ across neurodevelopmental diagnoses and
traits. We will also seek to further characterize our specialized outcome area of neurodevelopment, and
autism specifically, by conducting psychometric analyses of dimensional measures. Finally, we will 3) Maximize
recruitment and retention of our cohort participants via implementation of the ECHO protocol. We will
implement a unified recruitment and retention strategy facilitated by incentives and a network of support for
adolescents with neurodevelopmental conditions, transition-age autistic youth, and their families. TEAMS will be
the first longitudinal study of autistic younger sibling children followed from the womb to adulthood. In
doing so, our project presents unique opportunities to advance understanding of environmental predictors and
modifiers, conduct cross-outcome comparisons of neurodevelopmental disorders and their latent traits,
characterize multi-domain trajectories and identify predictors of positive outcomes in autistic adolescents, and
implement the ECHO Phase 2 protocol to ensure an expanded set of research possibilities in this important
population, and ultimately, optimize outcomes for autistic individuals and their families."

 The life expectancy for American Indians (AIs) living on the Blackfeet reservation in Northwest Montana
is 13 years shorter than the life expectancy of non-Hispanic Whites living in the same county, in part because
of disproportionately high incidence of chronic diseases including diabetes, depression, and cardiovascular
disease. While social connectedness has been shown to associate with health and disease-risk in other racial
groups, in AI populations, the prospective role of social connectedness in health disparities is unknown. This
has left a critical gap in knowledge regarding a potential factor which may offset enduring AI health disparities.
Our previous cross-sectional work in the Blackfeet community indicates relationships between low social
connectedness and health-risk factors including high levels of inflammatory cytokines, high resting blood
pressure, high levels of symptoms of depression and anxiety, and poor sleep quality. Each of these outcomes
is implicated in the onset and progression of the chronic diseases which disproportionately affect Blackfeet AI
adults. Based on these observed relationships, it is possible that social connectedness may act as resilience
factor which promotes good health in this at-risk community.
 To address this critical research gap, Blackfeet AI adults (n=280) will participate in a longitudinal study
over 2 years in order to capture meaningful long-term changes in mental and physical health and social
connectedness. With three measurements spaced evenly across the 2 years, we will track long-term
trajectories of social connectedness, mental health, sleep quality, and biomarkers related to risk for
inflammatory and cardiometabolic diseases, and investigate the correspondence between these trajectories
(Aim 1). During Year 1, over a 14-day monitoring period, we will use an ecological momentary assessment app
to deliver questions to participants’ mobile phones to investigate short-term dynamic relationships between
social interactions, social connectedness, sleep quality and indices of mental health (i.e. symptoms of
depression and anxiety) (Aim 2). In all of our models, we will consider cultural factors, experiences, and health-
risk factors which we have been found to be relevant in our previous work with the community including
childhood and historical trauma, recent trauma, perceived discrimination, alcohol use, smoking status, and
medication use. The overarching goal of the proposed work is to understand prospective relationships
between social connectedness and health in BF AI adults. This will be the first comprehensive, longitudinal
study to investigate relationships between social connectedness and health risk factors in AIs. This knowledge
could be applicable to other AI communities with similar cultural values and health disparities. Successful
demonstration of associations between social connectedness and health-relevant outcomes will enable us to
develop future interventions to improve social connectedness and thereby health in this vulnerable population."

B lymphocytes orchestrate autoimmune beta cell attack in type 1 diabetes (T1D) by presenting autoantigen to
T cells which kill beta cells. Circulating insulin autoantibodies (IAAs) are not directly pathogenic but help predict
T1D by signaling this dangerous B/T lymphocyte crosstalk. Immune targeting of insulin-producing beta cells
occurs for months or even decades before symptomatic diabetes onset. Heterogeneity in diabetes progression
and clinical trial responses slow the search for a T1D cure. Better biomarkers to identify and mechanistically
explain responders are needed to overcome this bottleneck. Protective immune responses typically arise by T
cell selection and affinity maturation of B lymphocytes in germinal centers, resulting in memory B lymphocyte
and antibody-secreting cell differentiation. However, autoimmune responses do not always follow this pathway.
For example, we find anti-insulin B cells (AIBCs) accelerate diabetes in T1D-prone mice, yet few AIBCs
differentiate into IAA-secreting cells, despite entering germinal centers. To fill gaps in knowledge AIBC
expansion early in T1D, we built a unique, carefully-curated biobank of pre-symptomatic T1D TrialNet
participants. We find AIBCs in the peripheral blood of IAA-negative pre-symptomatic T1D donors,
demonstrating B lymphocyte autoimmunity for insulin evades conventional detection via circulating IAAs in a
subset of at-risk individuals. Longitudinal sampling and clinical testing at each T1D TrialNet visit provide
opportunities to identify donor-specific changes as T1D progresses from stage 1 (normal glucose tolerance) to
stage 2 (impaired glucose tolerance) and stage 3 (diabetes). We find AIBCs are skewed towards a memory B
cell phenotype. Clonally-expanded, memory B lymphocytes express germline and minimally-mutated B cell
receptors in stage 1 T1D donors. These data support our hypothesis that AIBCs expand and enter the memory
compartment prior to glucose tolerance impairment, sometimes without IAA production. We will integrate AIBC
phenotype, B cell receptor (immunoglobulin) sequence identity, clonal relatedness, B cell receptor
affinity/avidity for insulin, and insulin epitope mapping to identify features that govern insulin recognition. High-
throughput single cell analysis of B cell receptor repertoire paired with cell phenotype will identify changes in
the same donor over time and with T1D stage progression to determine B lymphocyte repertoire and subset
shifts that occur as glucose tolerance is lost. In addition to memory skewing, AIBCs show biased V and J
immunoglobulin gene use. We will track this combination of features and use LIBRAseq to identify candidate
autoreactive BCRs to recombinantly express and test for islet autoantigen recognition, including other known
islet autoantigens (GAD65, IA-2, ICA512, and ZNT8). The human monoclonal antibodies, anti-insulin BCR
sequence database, and analysis pipeline/code we will develop will be made publicly available. These studies
are a necessary step towards using AIBCs as biomarkers in clinical trials to identify favorable changes in
cellular autoimmunity and zero in on specific changes AIBCs undergo to deconvolute response heterogeneity."

It is unclear which psychological and biological variables are potential maintenance factors for ME/CFS
following IM because few prospective studies have collected baseline data before the onset of IM and then
followed these subjects prospectively following the diagnosis of ME/CFS. In our currently funded NIH study,
the focus has been on pre-illness clinical and biological predictors of ME/CFS development following IM in a
diverse group of college students. General screens of health and psychological well-being, as well as blood,
were obtained at all three stages of the study (Stage 1 - when the students are well; Stage 2 – at the time they
are acutely ill with IM, Stage 3 – six months after IM, when they have either developed ME/CFS or recovered).
Wave 1 refers to data we are currently collecting and Wave 2 will be funded by the proposed grant and
involves a five-year follow-up with the original Wave 1 subjects. Cohort 1 includes those college students who
developed IM during Wave 1, and preliminary data indicate that these students showed marked differences at
baseline from those who did not develop ME/CFS 6 months following IM. Cohort 2 includes those who did not
develop IM in Wave 1. We expect some of these subjects will develop ME/CFS over time. Our study will
assess both clinical and biological maintenance factors for of ME/CFS following IM, and determine
prospectively the incidence of ME/CFS in a sample of young adults."
10746003,"Autoimmunity is thought to result from a combination of genetics, environmental triggers, and stochastic events.
A characteristic of systemic autoimmune diseases, like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), are autoantibodies
against nuclear antigens (ANA), however the events that initiate such autoantibody responses remain poorly
understood. This is due largely to an incomplete understanding of when and how autoimmunity begins in humans
and animals models of spontaneous autoimmunity. However, certain environmental/xenobiotic exposures have
been linked to autoimmunity in humans and reproduced in experimental animal models, thus providing model
systems where the initiating event and its exposure site are known. These induced models of autoimmunity
provide a unique opportunity for dissecting the immunological response specific to known inciting agents and
are significantly more amenable to identifying the early events necessary for autoimmunity that are difficult to
study in spontaneous autoimmune diseases. We propose to exploit this feature in order to study the early
molecular and cellular events leading to loss of B cell tolerance and autoantibody production. Mercury exposure
in humans is linked with pathological outcomes including inflammatory markers, autoantibodies and renal
pathology. These observation have been faithfully reproduced in experimental animal models. Importantly,
murine mercury-induced autoimmunity (mHgIA) induces an MHC-restricted autoantibody response against the
nucleolar protein fibrillarin which is also found in patients with SLE and Scleroderma. We believe that elucidation
of the mercury-induced anti-fibrillarin response will provide insight into the early events necessary for the creation
and expansion of autoreactive B cells, a cardinal feature of the autoimmune response. We propose three aims
that will define different, but related, events in the secondary lymphoid organs that result in loss of tolerance and
autoantibody production following mercury exposure. Aim 1 will define the early immunological steps in
xenobiotic-induced autoimmunity, and characterize the immunopathologic changes in the draining lymph nodes
(LNs), spleen and bone marrow following single and multiple subcutaneous exposures to mercury. In Aim 2 we
will determine what factors are critical for the development of activated CD4 T cells, autoimmune GCs, and
autoAbs in the early stages of mHgIA. Proposed experiments will determine how the deficiencies of several key
genes required for T-dependent immune responses in SLE or mHgIA (Unc93b1, Tlr7, Il6, and Ifng) affect the
early and autoimmune secondary lymphoid organ responses to HgCl2. Finally, Aim 3 studies will determine the
Hg-induced autoreactive B cell repertoire by characterizing the evolving B cell antigen receptor repertoire
induced by mercury exposure in secondary lymphoid organs. When completed these studies will lead to a greater
understanding of the early molecular and cellular events leading to development of autoantibody production."

The goal of this proposal is to identify genes that are required for neuro-developmental and cellular processes
critical to protective neonate respiratory reflexes that may be perturbed in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome
(SIDS) and other congenital respiratory pathophysiologies. To that end, we are in a unique position to leverage
the Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) Knockout Mouse Project-2 (KOMP2)/International Mouse Phenotyping
Consortium (IMPC) efforts to knock out or mutate and characterize every gene in the mouse genome. The
BCM KOMP2/IMPC effort is focused on adult as well as some embryonic and perinatal top-level phenotyping.
However, this effort does not systematically or deeply evaluate adult or neonate respiration. Thus, we aim to
leverage the BCM KOMP2/IMPS knockout production and phenotyping pipeline to identify genes critical to the
development and function of neural networks in neonate respiration.
The hypercapnic and hypoxic ventilatory reflexes are hypothesized to be perturbed in SIDS and several other congenital
respiratory disorders. Failure of the neonate auto-resuscitation reflex is thought to be a common end point for many
SIDS cases. Therefore across two aims, we propose to screen KOMP2 mutant mouse lines to identify novel genes
involved in the development and function of protective neonate respiratory reflexes including 1) the hypercapnic and
hypoxic ventilatory reflexes; 2) and the neonate auto-resuscitation reflex; 3) followed by an initial neuro-anatomical
characterization of cellular, molecular and genetic markers in the mutants. To achieve the high throughput capacity and
precision needed to screen sufficient numbers of mutant lines and gain meaningful results, we have developed a novel
robotic closed loop automated neonate respiratory platform and data analysis pipeline.
The proposed phenotyping pipeline will enable a multifaceted characterization of genes that when homozygously or
heterozygously mutated, disrupt critical protective neonate respiratory reflexes. The successful outcomes will deliver a
suite of genes that provide a foundation for additional studies to yield important clues about the genetic, molecular,
cellular processes that underly respiratory neural network development and function in neonates as well as inform upon
the mechanistic underpinnings of congenital pathophysiologies such as SIDS, CCHS, Rett Syndrome and others."
10750981,"Project Summary / Abstract
My long-term scientific goal is to understand the molecular mechanisms that specify retina cell number. Using
the compound eye of Drosophila as an experimental model, my laboratory has discovered the Hippo pathway
as a central mechanism underlying this process. The core of the Hippo pathway comprises a kinase cascade
in which the Ste20 kinase Hippo (Hpo) phosphorylates and activates the NDR family kinase Warts (Wts).
Wts, in turn, phosphorylates and inactivates the oncoprotein Yorkie (Yki) by excluding it from the nucleus,
where it normally functions as a coactivator for the DNA-binding transcription factor Scalloped (Sd). Our
research further established a critical role for the Hippo pathway in controlling organ size in mammals,
underscoring the importance of Drosophila as a powerful model to discover universal developmental
mechanisms.
Despite recent progress, our understanding of the composition, mechanism and regulation of Hippo signaling
remains incomplete. Much of our recent efforts have focused on discovering the missing components of the
Hippo pathway, with the ultimate goal of defining a complete Hippo signaling network. In the current grant
period, we have filled several key gaps in our understanding of the Hippo pathway, including a functional link
between Hippo signaling and the innate immunity receptor Toll, spectrin as an upstream regulator of Hippo
signaling by modulating actomyosin, autoinhibition of Hpo activity mediated by the STRIPAK phosphatase
complex, a Hpo-like kinase that functions redundantly with Hpo, a histone methyltransferase complex recruited
by Yki to activate the transcription of Hippo target genes, and a zinc finger transcriptional repressor recruited by
Sd to repress the transcription of Hippo target genes. We further contributed to the Hippo research community
by developing a set of fly stocks that can be used to unequivocally validate any Hippo pathway regulators through
rigorous genetic epistasis test.
In the next grant period, we will further elucidate the molecular underpinnings of the Hippo pathway through the
following specific aims. First, we will dissect the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which spectrin and
actomyosin cytoskeletons regulate Hippo signaling in developing tissues. Second, we will identify upstream
tumor suppressors that regulate Hippo signaling by antagonizing the activity of the STRIPAK phosphatase
complex. These studies will allow us to define how the STRIPAK phosphatase complex functions as a central
hub that integrates diverse upstream inputs into the Hippo pathway. Lastly, we will characterize novel regulators
of Hippo signaling isolated from a sensitized screen for mutations that enhance a partial loss-of-Hippo phenotype
in the eye. This unbiased approach will shed light on previously unforeseen regulators/mechanisms underlying
the Hippo pathway. Besides revealing fundamental mechanisms of eye development, the proposed studies will
have general implications for the development of other tissues."

 The proposed research will develop a conceptual and quantitative framework for proton-coupled electron
transfer (PCET) processes, in which the proton and electron transfer in a single chemical step. Such reactions
are key to a wide range of essential biochemical processes, including respiration, photosynthesis and other
aspects of bioenergetics, catalysis in oxidoreductases and other metalloenzymes, and the behavior of reactive
oxygen species and antioxidants. These chemical reactions vary from hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), in which
the two particles move ‘together,’ to processes where the proton and electron move to (or come from) different
locations (multiple-site concerted proton-electron transfers, MS-CPET). Building on our prior studies and the
specific advances in the last period. this project will examine how the rates and selectivities of such reactions
are controlled by factors beyond the thermochemistry.
 Many biochemical processes interconvert carbon-centered radicals and C–H bonds, yet some of their
reactions have little if any precedent in standard organic chemistry. For example, isoergic and uphill H-transfer
between carbon atoms are extremely slow in solution, yet such reactions are widely used by the enzyme families
with radical-SAM and vitamin B-12 cofactors, often reversibly. There are few solution examples of MS-CPET
reactions of C–H bonds, yet these are predicted to be used in various enzymes in biology. Experiments using
both organic and transition metal model systems will probe the essential properties of these reactions. These
will include (i) shortening the H-transfer distance; (ii) polar effects; and/or (iii) having asynchronous transfer of
the electron and proton due to asymmetry of the reaction free energy surface. HAT and MS-CPET processes
may involve these factors in different ways.
 The oxidations of O–H bonds in biological systems often occur by MS-CPET, with proton transfer to a
hydrogen-bonded base coupled to long-distance electron transfer. Examples range from the tyrosine-histidine
pair in photosystem II to the multiple tyrosines in ribonucleotide reductases. Our recent studies of anthracene-
phenol-pyridine triads provide new approaches to disentangle the key parameters affecting these reactions, their
intrinsic barriers, vibronic couplings, and the nature of the hydrogen bonds. These systems undergo very rapid
photo-induced PCET, including the first example of PCET in the Marcus Inverted Region, and can be tuned with
various substitutions. This is an excellent platform to investigate the key parameters of MS-CPET in hydrogen-
bonded systems, which are common biochemical reactions.
 This project will construct a more comprehensive and quantitative understanding of the intrinsic properties
of PCET that are relevant to a range of important biochemical processes. These fundamental insights about
redox reactions of C–H and O–H bonds will help unravel how biology evolved to control difficult transformations."

inflammation and fibrosis are postulated to be substantial mediators of HFpEF and are mechanistically relevant
among PWH whom demonstrate chronic systemic inflammation and immune activation and metabolic disease
regardless of immunological control. Rigorous hormonal testing from our group among PWH show increased
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activation is relation to reduced natriuretic peptide (NP) and
increased inflammation and monocyte/macrophage activation. NPs have cardioprotective effects, and relatively
reduced NPs could impair activities related to natriuresis, vasodilation, myocyte hypertrophy, and fibroblast
proliferation, altering stability of the myocardium. We further postulate relatively reduced NP, a phenotype
shown in highly metabolic groups and now demonstrated for the first time in HIV, may allow permissive RAAS
activation leading to downstream inflammation and myocardial damage. We aim to investigate the cardiac
phenotype associated with reduced NP among PWH compared to uninfected individuals utilizing advanced CV
imaging techniques (cardiac MRI, cardiac TTE) and circulating myocardial biomarkers to comprehensively
assess myocardial inflammation, structure, and function. This novel proposal represents a substantial
departure from the typically well-studied HF patients with relatively higher NP and may uncover a large class of
newly-identified inflammatory-prone or metabolically-deranged patients deserving of more clinical attention in
the HF realm. We will also determine the effect of sacubitril/valsartan, a dual angiotensin II receptor antagonist
and neprilysin inhibitor, vs. placebo on longitudinal changes in myocardial inflammation, structure and function
among PWH in a 6-month randomized controlled trial. These studies apply a novel concept in studying PWH,
among whom we postulate a therapy to simultaneously increase NP and decrease RAAS activation may be
beneficial for heart disease based on unique RAAS-NP physiology in HIV. These studies led by an early stage
investigator and team of experts in HIV-associated CVD, CV imaging, HFpEF phenotyping, CV biomarker
science, and CV endocrinology will provide key insight on two neurohormonal systems critical to CV health,
RAAS-NP, and test whether targeted manipulation of these systems can reduce subclinical HFpEF risk in HIV."

Reproductive health underpins overall health and thus research in reproductive science and medicine
is essential. This requires a steady pipeline of trained scientists and clinicians, which can be challenging
given the relatively small size of the field. Professional opportunities outside the laboratory and
classroom are essential to providing our trainees with important scientific, leadership, and career
development experiences. Since 2008, Northwestern and other institutions in Illinois, including the
University of Illinois Urbana Champaign (UIUC), have hosted a biannual meeting on a rotating basis
entitled the Illinois Symposium for Reproductive Science (ISRS). Given the strengths of our collective
focus on reproductive science, our extensive trainee community, as well as our established institutional
infrastructures, our goal is to now expand this event to include five states and 16 institutions across the
Upper Midwest region. This application seeks funds to support the Upper Midwest Summit for
Reproductive Science. This conference will be hosted by Northwestern and the University of Illinois
Urbana Champaign in alternate years. A hallmark of this event is that it is largely organized and
coordinated by trainees, providing valuable leadership and professional development experience. The
trainee planning committee will be responsible for identifying themes and speakers, hosting and
chaperoning speakers, acting as session moderators, and working the registration table. The event will
be held over a period of a day and a half and will consist of a variety of presentation formats. Dedicated
poster sessions throughout the meeting allow participants to present their research, receive
constructive feedback, and engage in constructive dialogue other attendees. Panel sessions and a
career roundtable lunch will enhance the program by moving beyond the bench to discuss topics such
as innovation, advocacy, and communication. There will also be an invited keynote speaker, who will
be a luminary in the field, as well as an alumni speaker who will be someone who participated in the
conference as a trainee and now has a successful career in our discipline. Sessions will be organized
by topics and invited speakers and trainees will deliver oral presentations at this time. Throughout the
conference there will be many opportunities for trainees to network with each other and the conference
will be an annual opportunity for trainees to facilitate interaction among potential future lab mates, PIs,
and collaborators. To further enhance the trainee experience, both institutions have committed to
provide funds for trainee research awards for outstanding oral platforms and poster presentations.
Priority will be given to individuals who are underrepresented in science to maximize broad participation
of diverse speakers and trainees. Together we will leverage our collective institutional strengths to
maintain the Upper Midwest Region as a preeminent nationwide leader in this critical research field."

Psychiatric disorders are the most prevalent debilitating illnesses across the lifespan. Importantly, epidemiologic
studies indicate that 75% of all diagnosable psychiatric disorders begin prior to age 24, highlighting the need for
investigations of the developing brain. Exposure to traumatic events during childhood and adolescence can
induce maladaptive functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, leading to long-term structural
and functional alterations in stress-sensitive brain regions that are known to be critical for cognitive control.
Similar neural aberrations have been identified across a range of mental health disorders, including anxiety,
ADHD, and depression. However, the extant literature focusing specifically on the impact of trauma and HPA
axis activation on the development of cognitive control networks is extremely sparse. Given the high incidence
of trauma in youth and ties with psychopathology, it is imperative that we develop a more detailed understanding
of the neurophysiological changes underlying brain development in the context of trauma exposure.
The proposed fellowship aims to partially remedy these knowledge gaps by utilizing the excellent spatial and
temporal precision (i.e., millisecond) of magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate the developmental
trajectory of brain networks critical to cognitive control and the impact of trauma and HPA axis activation on such
networks. Briefly, participants between the ages of 6 to 15 years-old will annually complete a cognitive control
task during MEG, complete cognitive and emotional assessments, and provide hair samples. The resulting MEG
data will be transformed into the time-frequency domain and imaged using a beamforming approach, while the
hair samples will be used to compute mean cortisol concentrations over 3 months. The output dynamic functional
maps will be used to examine spectrally specific brain responses that are developmentally-sensitive in regions
critical to cognitive control. Aim 1 will map the longitudinal development of neural dynamics and network
connectivity that underlie response selection in typically-developing youth from age 6 to 15 years-old. Aim 2 will
determine the impact of trauma exposure and HPA axis activation on the longitudinal development of cognitive
control networks, neuropsychological performance, and emotional health. To this end, we will leverage the latest
MEG and source reconstruction techniques, neural oscillatory dynamics and connectivity analysis methods, hair
cortisol concentrations, and cognitive assessments to map variability in the neurophysiological bases of cognitive
control development in healthy youth. In addition to the sponsor, who is a developmental cognitive neuroscientist
with extensive mentoring and NIH funding experience, we will leverage an expert mentoring team comprised of
leaders in cortisol analysis (Dr. Megan Gunnar), trauma assessment (Dr. Patrick Tyler), and the neuronal impact
of childhood adversity (Dr. Christopher Monk). In summary, this research will aid in providing a more complete
foundational understanding of the key neurological processes underlying cognitive control perturbations in youth
with trauma and identify potential windows for intervention."

 Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive, genetically diverse, and universally lethal
malignancy of the brain. The aggressive characteristics and genetic diversity observed in GBM have
been linked to a population of cells with stem-like characteristics known as glioblastoma stem cells
(GSCs). In collaboration with the Rich lab, we have shown that EYA2 (eyes absent transcriptional
coactivator and phosphatase 2) is highly expressed in GSCs compared to differentiated glioblastoma
cells (DGCs) and neural stem cells (NSCs), where it is highly localized to centrosomes. Importantly,
GSCs are uniquely reliant on EYA2’s tyrosine phosphatase (Tyr Ptase) activity for proliferation, as
pharmacological inhibition of EYA2’s Tyr Ptase activity or overexpression of an EYA2 Tyr Ptase dead
mutant causes cell cycle arrest, mono- and multipolar spindle abnormalities, and apoptosis when
compared to DGCs and NSCs. Together, these data provide evidence that the Tyr Ptase activity of
EYA2 elicits a novel function at centrosomes that is required for GSC proliferation.
 We have previously demonstrated that several cancers re-express EYA proteins to promote
tumorigenic and metastatic phenotypes through multiple cytoplasmic and nuclear functions. The Tyr
Ptase activity of EYA proteins is implicated in cell cycle progression in several cancers, but the
molecular cause of these phenotypes is mostly unknown. Intriguingly, EYA proteins have not
previously been shown to function at centrosomes. My data highlights that EYA2 is localized to
centrosomes in GSCs and that inhibition of EYA2’s Tyr Ptase activity leads to centrosome
fragmentation in mitotic GSCs, suggesting a novel, mitotic regulatory role for EYA2 in cancer.
Furthermore, using EYA2 substrate-trapping experiments I have identified several centrosome-
associated proteins and mitotic regulators as potential substrates of EYA2’s Tyr Ptase activity.
Because the precise mechanism for EYA2’s Tyr Ptase activity at centrosomes and in mitotic spindle
formation remains elusive, in this proposal I will test the hypothesis that EYA2’s tyrosine
phosphatase activity is directly required at centrosomes for centrosome maturation and
mitotic spindle formation, and that direct targets of the EYA2 Tyr Ptase activity can be
identified that are critical for mitotic progression."

Asthma is one of the most prevalent chronic conditions in the United States (US); it is also one of the most
disparate. Both in the US and in New York City (NYC), differences exist in asthma prevalence, morbidity, and
mortality by racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups. Substandard conditions faced by lower-income families
living in rented or public housing partially drive these asthma disparities by increasing exposure to indoor asthma
triggers such as mold. Mold can release spores, fragments, and toxins into the air which can lead to respiratory
responses; mold has been causally implicated in both the development and exacerbation of asthma. Despite the
known adverse health impacts of mold, proprietors have little incentive to perform remediations. Mold
remediations, especially those targeting the root causes of water damage and mold growth, may be costly, often
requiring pipe, roof, or ventilation system replacement. Thus, mold issues, especially in renter-occupied homes,
often go unaddressed. There are critical knowledge gaps surrounding (a) how, in the context of climate change,
mold growth exacerbates asthma disparities and (b) if mold interventions have the largest health benefits for
those needing it the most. Residents of the NYC Housing Authority (NYCHA) – the largest public housing
authority in North America, housing over 380,000 NYC residents – have long endured disproportionate
exposures to dampness and mold in their homes, likely contributing to consistently high rates of asthma
morbidity. However, in 2019, NYCHA implemented ‘Mold Busters’—a comprehensive program aimed to remove
mold in NYCHA developments. ‘Mold Busters’ presents a natural experiment and a wealth of data that could be
leveraged for our objectives: to understand (a) the dual burdens of mold growth and climate change faced by
NYCHA residents (b) neighborhood and building characteristics conducive to mold growth and (c) changes in
asthma morbidity resulting from ‘Mold Busters’—all of which could inform housing agencies’ approaches for mold
problems. We will combine building-level, longitudinal mold reports collected by NYCHA with longitudinal
meteorological and asthma-related emergency department visit data. First, we will conduct time series analyses
to quantify the relationship between extreme weather events, expected to increase with climate change, and
reports of mold, both overall and considering neighborhood and building characteristics that may modify this
relationship (Aim 1). Next, we will use pre-‘Mold Busters’ data to understand the neighborhood and building
characteristics that contribute to mold growth and asthma morbidity (Aim 2). Finally, we will conduct building-
level difference-in-difference (DiD) analyses comparing pre/post-‘Mold Busters’ asthma-related emergency
department visits in NYCHA buildings to non-NYCHA, control buildings, while considering neighborhood,
building, and individual characteristics (Aim 3). If we are successful, together these analyses will inform future
interventions by identifying vulnerable neighborhoods, buildings, and subgroups where further action targeting
mold and/or asthma morbidity is necessary, and that climate change will disproportionately affect."
10908738,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Training Program
Despite the urgent need to address maternal mortality, severe morbidity, and disparities, previous efforts have
failed to improve maternal health outcomes. Notably, most research efforts to reduce maternal mortality and
severe maternal morbidity have focused on clinical care and have not addressed the role of the maternal
health workforce in the community. To effectively reduce maternal health inequities and improve outcomes,
more research focused on structural and social determinants maternal health is needed, especially research
conducted in underserved areas by researchers from those communities. To this end, our proposed
Mississippi Delta Research Center of Excellence for Maternal Health will include a training program for
early-stage investigators focused on addressing the interpersonal and structural factors that affect maternal
health outcomes in at-risk communities. In meeting the challenges posed by the social determinants of health,
there is increasing recognition of the importance of research conducted with people and in places with the
greatest vulnerability. This includes valuing the potential of scientists working in historically under-resourced
institutions and with underserved communities, such as researchers at institutions located in limited-resource
regions of the Southern United States and at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) across the
rural–urban continuum. Our proposed training program will focus on early-stage investigators at two
Mississippi HBCUs, Jackson State University and Alcorn State University, and will leverage existing resources
in maternal health training within these universities, at the Southern Rural Development Center based at
Mississippi State University, and at Harvard University. Our collaborative approach will capitalize on the
expertise of our program leads and community partners in maternal health systems and the strong existing
relationships among the various participating institutions. The overarching goal of our research training
program is to foster culturally responsive research that addresses maternal health disparities. We will achieve
this goal through (1) increasing the number of postdoctoral trainees, junior faculty, and other early-stage
investigators engaging in research related to biological, behavioral, environmental, sociocultural, and/or
structural factors that affect pregnancy-related and pregnancy-associated morbidity and mortality and severe
maternal morbidity in the Mississippi Delta; (2) providing applied research experiences to predoctoral fellows
as the next generation of maternal health research professionals; and (3) providing outreach opportunities to
reach a broader audience. Our extensive research training program will support the goals of the center’s
research projects, address the interpersonal and structural factors that affect maternal health outcomes, and
prepare the next generation of clinical researchers focused on maternal health outcomes and equity.

The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley seeks to establish a Diversity Center for Genome Research that will
build UTRGV’s genomics research capacity by 1) expanding genomic research capabilities and discoveries in
two innovative research projects; and 2) enhancing the size and quality of the available genomics workforce.
Leveraging the exciting activities and resources available in the two highly innovative research projects, the
Center’s structure and approach are designed to expand the pool of diverse genomic scientists, clinician
scientists, and researchers at both the doctoral and technical staff levels who can perform cutting-edge
multidisciplinary genomics research. The Center’s Workforce Development Core includes efforts to develop the
pipeline of Hispanic pre-college students interested in careers in genetics and genomics so that workforce
development programs will expand and become self-sustaining in the future. The Center’s Community
Engagement Core is designed to improve genomic literacy in the predominantly Hispanic local population and
increase interest in participation in genomic studies. The research in the two multidisciplinary projects to be
supported by the Center is focused on diseases that are important health disparities for the local Mexican
American population, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and major depressive disorder. The team science-focused
research will be meaningful to our trainees since the diseases under investigation disproportionately impact
Mexican American families. The research programs leverage state-of-the-art instrumentation to provide
outstanding training opportunities for faculty, students, postdocs, and residents. Cutting-edge technologies are
incorporated into the projects, maximizing the impact of training and research experiences. Techniques and
approaches used in the projects include bioinformatics, computational genomics, statistical genetics, molecular
genetics, genetic epidemiology, genomics, proteomics, exposomics, stem cell biology, novel statistical methods,
environmental chemistry, environmental epidemiology, neuroscience, imaging genomics, and medical
anthropology. The proposed research areas provide an outstanding range of training opportunities and are rich
with potential spin-off projects for junior faculty and senior faculty seeking to branch into genomics. Through the
activities of its Administrative Core, Workforce Development Core, Community Engagement Core, and Research
Projects, the proposed UTRGV Diversity Center for Genome Research will support cutting-edge genomic
research, capacity building, and training in genomics at one of the nation’s largest Hispanic-serving institutions."

and activities of the Center. In order to maximize the impact of the Center, the Administrative Core will facilitate
participation in national genomics consortia, including the consortium of NHGRI Diversity Centers. Center
investigators already participate in TOPMed, T2D Genes, ENIGMA, WGSPD, and AMP T2D Genes. The
Administrative Core will use a variety of approaches to communicate with the scientific and local communities
about opportunities available through the Center and progress made by the Center, including an annual
Genomics Research Symposium and an annual Texas Mexico Research Collaboration Colloquium. The
Administrative Core will be responsible for implementing the Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives. Through
its varied activities, the Administrative Core will work to ensure the success of the UTRGV Diversity Center for
Genome Research."
10931443,"Summary
Our understanding of cell lineages is currently being challenged. Cell plasticity appears to be more prevalent
than previously thought and cell fate switching, even among fully differentiated cells is being more fully
uncovered and understood. For example, ‘paligenosis’ is an emerging concept whereby fully differentiated cells
revert to a stem cell like state and give rise to a multitude of cell types in part due to mTOR signaling. These
observations have important implications for bone fracture healing. Multiple differentiation events occur for the
bone to heal. Initially, the mechanical environment directs cell fate decisions within the periosteum. Mechanical
stability directs differentiation of osteoblasts and intramembranous ossification, while instability directs
differentiation of chondrocytes and endochondral ossification. Concomitantly, the stem cell compartment is
maintained, and a renewed stem cell pool will eventually populate the periosteum that covers the new bone. At
later stages of endochondral ossification chondrocytes become osteoblasts as the cartilage transforms into
bone. Disruptions to these distinct events can lead to delayed or failed healing, which is often associated with
increased fibrosis of the fracture site. In this application we propose to examine the process of differentiation of
periosteal cells in response to the mechanical environment (Aim1), to assess transformation of chondrocytes
into osteoblasts (Aim 2), and maintenance of the stem cell pool and population of the newly formed periosteum
by stem cells (Aim 3). This work utilizes a systems biology approach to examine molecular mechanisms that
underlie these cell fate decisions, and in parallel a more standard hypothesis-based approach. We focus on
the role of Nf1 and Sox2 during differentiation of periosteal cells and the transformation of chondrocytes into
osteoblasts. Our preliminary data show that deletion of Nf1 from the developing periosteum leads to a fibrous
non-union after fracture, and we focus on the role of mTOR in mediating these outcomes. Our data also show
that Sox2 is necessary for endochondral ossification, and we test the requirement of Sox2 in hypertrophic
chondrocytes for transformation to osteoblasts. Finally, we examine a role for Sox2 in maintaining the stem cell
compartment in the periosteum using a set of loss-of-function experiments in serial fracture repair. In summary,
combining a systems biology approach with hypothesis testing is a powerful way to develop deep
understanding of the processes regulating cell differentiation during fracture healing."

 TAZ/YAP are transcriptional effectors and proto-oncoproteins of the Hippo pathway, a signal transduction
pathway regulating tumor growth and metastasis in multiple cancers including sarcomas. While much has been
uncovered with regards to the upstream regulation of TAZ and YAP, little is known about epigenetic regulation
of their transcriptional programs, representing a significant gap in knowledge. To address this gap, we utilized
the TAZ-CAMTA1 (TC) and YAP-TFE3 (YT) fusion proteins. TC and YT are driving oncoproteins in epithelioid
hemangioendothelioma (EHE), a sarcoma arising in adolescents (responsive to PA-16-251, Gene Fusions in
Pediatric Sarcomas). TC and YT, hyperactivated forms of TAZ and YAP, are relevant because gene fusions
are the most common type of genetic alterations of TAZ/YAP in cancer. Our objective in this proposal is to
determine if TC and YT further stimulate TAZ/YAP transcription by altering the epigenome. Our central
hypothesis is that TC and YT recruit YEATS2 and ZZZ3, part of the Ada2a-containing (ATAC) histone
acetyltransferase complex, which potentiate the TAZ/YAP oncogenic transcriptional programs. This hypothesis
is supported by two serial unbiased approaches: BioID mass spectrometry followed by an shRNA screen that
identified YEATS2 and ZZZ3 as the proteins most critical for TC driven anchorage independent growth. We
plan to test our central hypothesis with the following specific aims utilizing TC, the predominant fusion protein
in EHE (85% of EHE):
Aim 1) Determine how YEATS2 and ZZZ3 alter the TAZ-CAMTA1 transcriptional program.
We will perform ChIP-seq and determine if TC co-localizes with YEATS2 and ZZZ3 on the genome. RNA-seq
will be performed in TC expressing cell lines with and without expression of YEATS2 or ZZZ3 to identify their
effects on the TC transcriptome.
Aim 2) Identify domains of TAZ-CAMTA1, YEATS2, and ZZZ3 required for cellular transformation.
The interaction of YEATS2 and ZZZ3 with TC will be dissected by co-immunoprecipitation utilizing deletion
mutants. The mutants will be further studied in anchorage independent growth assays we have developed.
Aim 3) Determine the contributions of the YEATS2 and ZZZ3 interactions with TAZ-CAMTA1 in vivo.
We will use both genetic and pharmacological approaches to inhibit YEATS2/ZZZ3/ATAC function in novel TC
transgenic and xenograft sarcoma mouse models and evaluate their effect on tumorigenesis and metastasis.
 The proposal is innovative because it utilizes TC and YT as well as two serial unbiased approaches to
identify YEATS2/ZZZ3/ATAC as novel epigenetic regulators of the TAZ/YAP transcriptome, expanding the
focus of the field and addressing a significant gap in knowledge. The project is significant because it identifies
YEATS2 and ZZZ3 as novel oncoproteins and drivers in sarcoma and provides a rationale for inhibiting histone
modifying complexes as a novel way of targeting the Hippo pathway, which currently lacks a therapeutic target."

The elderly have increased susceptibility to periodontitis, a prevalent inflammatory disease that causes
destruction of the tooth-supporting tissues (periodontium). This increased susceptibility is likely caused by
alterations to the immuno-inflammatory status and/or regenerative potential of the periodontal tissue. Impaired
tissue regeneration may be traced back to age-related alterations in the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) niche of
the periodontal ligament (PDL), harboring the osteoprogenitors. Del-1 is a homeostatic protein secreted by
distinct tissue resident cells: It regulates the recruitment of neutrophils (endothelial cell-derived Del-1) and the
efferocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils (macrophage-derived Del-1), thus Del-1 controls both the initiation and
resolution of inflammation. Additional research has shown that Del-1 is produced in the PDL and promotes
osteoblastic differentiation as well as induces the formation of new alveolar bone during resolution of
experimental periodontitis. However, Del-1 expression is severely diminished in old age. This project investigates
the overarching hypothesis that the aging-related Del-1 deficiency may contribute to the dysregulation of
osteogenesis, thereby leading to defective periodontal bone regeneration in old age. This proposal comprises
two specific aims and focuses on relevant animal model-based mechanistic and intervention studies, including
mice with lineage-specific deletions or overexpression of Del-1 or its receptor β3 integrin. In Aim 1, it is proposed
that Del-1 promotes osteoblastic differentiation by acting via its RGD motif on β3 integrin in osteolineage
progenitors. Aim 2 involves the elucidation of the mechanisms by which Del-1 regulates osteogenesis in vivo
and, moreover, examines the consequences of aging-related Del-1 deficiency on bone regeneration. It is also
proposed that impaired bone regeneration in old mice can be reversed by local administration of Del-1. On the
basis that the regenerative defect of the aged PDL-MSC niche is reversible and regulated by the extrinsic
microenvironment, the findings of this proposal may potentially pave the way to novel Del-1-based approaches
to rejuvenate niche functionality and thus enhance periodontal bone regeneration in old age."

Ubiquitous and conserved molecular chaperones Hsp70s and Hsp110s form one of the most essential
chaperone machineries in maintaining protein homeostasis (proteostasis). However, the molecular mechanisms
and exact role of Hsp110s in this chaperone machinery remain largely unclear. As distant homologs of Hsp70s,
Hsp110s are both independent chaperones and co-chaperones for Hsp70s. As independent chaperones,
Hsp110s demonstrate a unique high chaperone activity in preventing aggregation of denatured proteins, the
holdase activity. As co-chaperones, Hsp110s function as the major nucleotide-exchange factor (NEF) for
Hsp70s. Although the importance and mechanism of the NEF activity is well-characterized, the function and
involvement of the holdase activity is almost completely unknown primarily due to the lack of any available
approach to disrupt this holdase activity without affecting the NEF activity. Msi3 is the sole and essential Hsp110
in Candida albicans, the most prevalent cause of fungal infections in humans. Our preliminary studies have
identified a novel inhibitor for Msi3, named 2H. Excitingly, 2H specifically abolishes the holdase activity while
leaving the NEF activity largely intact. Importantly, 2H was seen to reduce protein folding both in vitro and in
vivo, providing the first direct evidence to support the importance of the holdase activity of an Hsp110 in the
Hsp70s/Hsp110s chaperone machinery. In addition, as the first inhibitor for fungal Hsp110s, 2H effectively
eliminates the growth and viability of C. albicans with limited toxicity in human cells, supporting that Hsp110s are
an important target for designing novel and potent therapeutics for fungal infections and 2H may represent a
promising lead compound for a new class of antifungals for future medicinal chemistry efforts.
 Taking advantage of the unique selectivity of 2H, the overall objective of this proposal is two-fold: 1)
to characterize the elusive molecular mechanism and biological function of the holdase activity of Hsp110s, and
2) to increase mechanistic understanding of Hsp110s as a new therapeutic target for fungal infections.
Accordingly, we propose two Specific Aims. Aim 1: Characterize the in vivo function of Hsp110's holdase activity
in proteostasis using 2H. Taking advantage of the powerful and facile genetics available to the yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we aim to directly analyze the conserved functions of Hsp110s' holdase activity in
two essential in vivo processes in proteostasis: protein folding and import into endoplasmic reticulum. We expect
to identify and characterize endogenous substrates for Hsp110s for the first time. Aim 2: Elucidate the inhibitory
mechanism via structural characterization of 2H in complex with Msi3. We aim to solve the structures of Msi3,
both alone and complexed with 2H, which will reveal the specific binding interactions between 2H and Msi3 and
the mechanism of 2H's inhibition of Msi3. We expect that our innovative proposal will make paradigm-shifting
discoveries on the function and mechanism of Hsp110s in the Hsp70s/Hsp110s chaperone machinery and pave
a solid foundation for our future effort to develop novel and selective antifungals by targeting Hsp110s."
10925355,"SUMMARY
Glioblastoma (GBM) remains deadly. A major reason is a highly infiltrative GBM border, making complete
surgical resection unattainable. Residual tumor cells inevitably spawn recurrent GBM, typically within 2-3 cm of
resection cavity. Understanding GBM margins is thus critical to curb GBM invasion and relapse. Tumor-
associated myeloid cells (TAMs) are the most abundant stromal cells in GBM, and they promote GBM expansion
and infiltration through immunosuppressive properties, secretion of tumor-promoting factors (gliomagens), and
preparation of invasion tracks. Previous research has largely focused on bone-marrow derived macrophages
(MDMs), which reside mostly in GBM interior, less is defined for microglia (MG), resident innate immune cells in
the brain that preferentially congregate at GBM margins. The current proposal intends to fill this gap by testing
the central hypothesis that perturbing the supportive niche provided by margin-MG may help slow down GBM
invasion and relapse. The premise of the approach rests on our compelling preliminary data establishing MG as
one of the most abundant immune cell populations at GBM borders. Furthermore, our pilot study demonstrated
that targeting MG proliferation (via IL-1/IL1R1 signaling) or MG motility/alignment (via axon guidance receptor
Plexin-B2) resulted in significant reduction of GBM growth and invasion. However, major knowledge gaps remain:
i) what are the signaling networks driving the persistence of tumor-promoting phenotypes of margin-MG, ii) does
genetic make-up of the tumor play a role in dictating the immune landscape at GBM margin, iii) what is the nature
of MG-derived gliomagens, iv) can we find a way to target margin-MG interactions with GBM cells, and v) how
does chemoradiation therapy alter gene signatures and tumor-promoting gliomagens of margin-MG? To address
these questions, in Aim 1, we will map the immune contexture and crosstalk with tumor cells at GBM margins
using multiplex immunostaining, advanced spectral flow cytometry, single cell transcriptomics, and spatial
multiomics. Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of GBM with defined driver mutations and human
GBM tissues of matching subtypes will be used. We will identify distinct margin-MG populations and pro-
tumorigenic signals originating from margin-MG. We will also conduct co-cultures and ex vivo organotypic brain
slice studies for validation. In Aim 2, we will study the functional significance of margin-MG in promoting GBM
expansion and invasion by examining the efficacy of targeting MG proliferation (via IL-1/IL1R1 signaling), MG
motility/alignment (via Plexin-B2 signaling), or both, using genetic and pharmacological approaches in GEMMs
of GBM. This will provide proof-of-principle that targeting key signaling pathways with different mechanisms of
action may achieve synergistic effects for perturbing the supportive niche provided by MG at invasive margins.
In Aim 3, we will examine the impact of chemoradiation on margin-GBM profiles, gliomagens, and functional
significance in GBM recurrence. The new knowledge will help leveraging the signaling networks underlying
intrinsic functions of tumor-promoting resident innate immune cells in order to curb GBM invasion and relapse."

Diabetes results from insufficient functional β-cell mass to meet peripheral insulin demands. β-cells rely upon
mitochondrial respiration to generate the energy necessary for insulin biosynthesis, processing, and secretion.
Indeed, defects in mitochondrial structure and function have been reported in the β-cells of patients with type 2
diabetes (T2D). Defects in mitochondrial structure and function are characteristic of impairments in mitochondrial
dynamics, the balance of fusion and fission of mitochondrial networks. Mitochondrial fusion is governed by
several dynamin-like GTPases, including Mitofusins 1 and 2 (Mfn1 and 2). Expression of Mfn1 and/or Mfn2 are
reduced in human T2D islets, mouse models of T2D, and following the deposition of toxic islet amyloid
polypeptide oligomers. However, the functions of Mfn1 and Mfn2 in β-cells in vivo, and their role in T2D
pathogenesis are unclear. Therefore, our goal is to dissect the mechanistic and physiologic regulation of
mitochondrial fusion in β-cells to elucidate its contribution to diabetes pathogenesis. The central hypothesis to
be tested is that Mfn1 and 2 regulate insulin secretion and islet β-cell connectivity through control of mitochondrial
DNA and network stability, and their dysregulation contribute to β-cell failure in T2D. We will test this hypothesis
by the following approach: Specific Aim 1 will directly assess the mechanistic implications of loss of mitochondrial
fusion on control of mitochondrial DNA copy number. Specific Aim 2 will delineate the mechanisms by which
incretins restore insulin secretion following impairments in mitochondrial fusion. Specific Aim 3 will investigate
the importance of mitofusins within human β-cells. We anticipate obtaining a clear understanding of the
importance and translational relevance of mitochondrial fusion in β-cell function from an evaluation of the central
effectors crucial to the maintenance of mitochondrial structure. These results should advance the field of β-cell
biology by defining the role of mitochondrial fusion in T2D pathogenesis and could open new horizons for
therapies for patients with diabetes."

 Patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) exhibit progressive memory loss, depression, and anxiety,
accompanied by impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). Although young adult-born neurons (ABNs)
have been shown to play an important role in memory and emotion processing under physiological conditions,
their function and therapeutic potential in degenerated AD brains remain largely undefined. A long-standing
question has been centering on whether AHN could be enhanced in otherwise impaired AD brains to restore
cognitive and affective functions. Our recent study showed that stimulating hypothalamic supramammillary
nucleus (SuM) exerts robust neurogenic effects in healthy wild-type (WT) mice. Specifically, chronic patterned
optogenetic stimulation of SuM leads to increased production of behaviorally-relevant ABNs with enhanced
developmental properties. Importantly, acute chemogenetic activation of these SuM-enhanced ABNs improves
memory performance and reduces anxiety-like behavior. We further tested this strategy in 5xFAD mice. Strikingly,
patterned SuM stimulation restores the number and developmental properties of ABNs and acute chemogenetic
activation of a small population of these SuM-enhanced ABNs (~500 ABNs/DG, <0.05% total granule cells/DG)
is sufficient to restore memory and reduce anxiety/depression-like behaviors in AD mice. These findings highlight
the therapeutic potential of enhanced ABNs (number, quality, and activity) in functional restoration in AD. Building
upon these findings, we propose the following aims to decipher the mechanisms underlying these beneficial
effects mediated by activation of SuM-enhanced ABNs using two complementary AD mouse models. Aim 1 will
determine the functional properties of SuM-enhanced ABNs and the molecular regulators underlying SuM-
mediated enhancement of neurogenesis in AD mice. Aim 2 will determine activity-dependent contribution of
SuM-enhanced ABNs to local hippocampal circuit and brain-wide network dynamics in AD mice. Aim 3 will
determine the effects of SuM-enhanced ABN activation on microglia properties, AD pathology, and hippocampal
function in AD mice."

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States for which
surgery remains a critical treatment option. The appropriate extent of resection for NSCLC is highly dependent
on intra-operative decision-making. Specifically, the diagnosis of NSCLC is often determined intra-operatively
by a limited resection of a suspicious pulmonary nodule, and intraoperative diagnosis is required before
proceeding to a larger, cancer-specific resection during the same procedure. Further, intraoperative evaluation
of resection margins is required in NSCLC surgeries to assure complete cancer removal before leaving the
operating room (OR). Thus, the ability to accurately diagnose NSCLC and determine surgical margins in the OR
is critical in the care for patients with NSCLC. However, the current technology used for intraoperative evaluation
of NSCLC diagnosis and margins is frozen section analysis, a century-old technique that is labor-intensive and
prone to error. Frozen section analysis also extends operative time, subjecting patients to increased risks of
surgical complications. New technologies that can provide surgeons with the ability to rapidly and accurately
diagnose NSCLC in the OR and evaluate surgical margins with high accuracy are critically needed to improve
surgical care and outcomes for patients. We have reported the development of an innovative technology, the
MasSpec Pen (MSPen), for rapid and non-destructive diagnosis of cancer tissues. The MSPen deploys a single
droplet of water to gently extract molecules from tissues, which are then analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS)
and statistical classifiers to provide diagnosis in seconds. We have demonstrated that the MSPen can accurately
diagnose NSCLC using banked tissues with 97% accuracy. We have also shown that the MSPen system can
be translated to the OR for use by surgeons for rapid in vivo and ex vivo tissue analysis. Through a collaborative
partnership between academic scientists and surgeons at Baylor College of Medicine and the R&D team at
MSPen Technologies Inc., we now propose to refine and validate the MSPen for intraoperative diagnosis and
surgical margin evaluation in NSCLC. Our objective is to optimize and translate new MSPen technology for
NSCLC detection, test its functionality, and validate its performance in the OR setting, thus delivering a potentially
improved platform for intraoperative lung tissue analysis to surgeons - the end users. Our specific aims are: Aim
1. Optimize the MSPen Technology for intraoperative use in NSCLC operations. We will develop a next-gen
MSPen platform for use in open and robotic NSCLC surgeries; Aim 2. Validate the MSPen for NSCLC diagnosis.
We will conduct a prospective observational study allowing thoracic surgeons to validate the technology for
NSCLC diagnosis in the OR; Aim 3. Validate the MSPen for intraoperative surgical margin evaluation in NSCLC.
We will validate the MSPen technology for surgical margin evaluation in vivo and ex vivo, including the most
representative tissue margins that are currently disregarded in clinical care. Our propose has the potential to
offer transformative benefits to surgeons in advancing the surgical standard of care for patients with lung cancer."
10861046,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The mechanosensitivity of the inner ear hair cells depends on cellular projections known as
stereocilia, organized in rows of increasing height, with mechano-electrical transduction (MET) channels
located at the tips of shorter row stereocilia. The core of stereocilia consists of a highly crosslinked
paracrystalline array of actin filaments. While crosslinker proteins are constantly renewed, the renewal of
actin is limited to the stereocilia tips. We previously reported that the stereocilia actin core exhibits activity-dependent plasticity (Velez-Ortega, et al., eLife 2017). We showed that the blockage of MET channels
or the breakage of the tip links that gate these channels lead to the selective shortening of transducing
stereocilia (i.e. the stereocilia that harbor MET channels), while the non-transducing tallest row stereocilia
remain unaffected. Once the MET blockage is removed or the tip links regenerate, the stereocilia regrow.
Our preliminary data also show that this MET-dependent stereocilia remodeling can affect the resting
tension within the MET machinery in seconds. Thus, this process may dynamically regulate the sensitivity
of hair cells to sound-induced vibrations and, hence, the sensitivity of our hearing. Yet, the exact
mechanisms of MET-dependent stereocilia remodeling are still obscure. It is unknown even whether the
activity-dependent plasticity of the stereocilia cytoskeleton is limited to the regions of active actin renewal
or can expand beyond this region into the “stable” part of the stereocilia shaft. Here, we hypothesize that
the MET activity regulates the extent of the stereocilia cytoskeleton undergoing active actin remodeling.
To test this, Aim 1 will evaluate MET-dependent changes in actin dynamics within the stereocilia and the
cuticular plate, an actin-rich structure supporting the stereocilia bundle. Aim 2 will evaluate MET-driven
changes in the ultrastructural organization of stereocilia actin with transmission electron microscopy
tomography. Since the MET-dependent stereocilia remodeling was studied so far only in young postnatal
hair cells, Aim 3 will assess whether this phenomenon is present also in the mature adult auditory hair
cells. In Aim 4, we begin to explore the molecular players involved in the MET-driven stereocilia
remodeling, by evaluating the expression of so-called “stereocilia row identity proteins” in a mutant mouse
model that exhibits MET-dependent actin remodeling not only in transducing stereocilia but also,
unexpectedly, in non-transducing stereocilia. The study is significant, because it may clarify how exactly
a hair cell performs fine adjustments of the architecture of the stereocilia bundle, thereby maintaining the
sensitivity of our hearing throughout a lifetime. In addition, stereocilia shortening—and perhaps their
eventual disappearance—could occur after noise exposure (when the MET current is reduced due to tip
link breakage) or in certain cases of congenital deafness (due to impaired MET current). Therefore, this
study will expand our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of various types of hearing loss."

10755345,"ABSTRACT – METHODS CORE
The Methods Core supports the CHIPTS mission by guiding measurement, statistical methods, and
implementation science across the center's aims and initiatives, maximizing innovation and impact. It applies
methods expertise specifically toward assessing influences of mental health, substance use, and social and
structural determinants of health on HIV-associated treatment and prevention outcomes. We respond to an
HIV research environment with an expanding mix of biomedical strategies, including long-acting agents for HIV
prevention and treatment, as well as a growing need to integrate information from multiple data sources (e.g.
mobile-phone-based assessments, electronic health records, laboratory data, administrative and public-use
databases). The push toward implementation science, community-partnered research, and team science
demands development of new methods. The Methods Core also targets measurement and evaluation of
persistent disparities across diverse racial/ethnic and sexual/gender minority populations in advancing HIV
research methodology when conducting investigator-initiated research and service-oriented activities. The
specific aims are (1) Science: To foster and facilitate cutting-edge HIV research by developing and
disseminating innovative technologies and analytic strategies for combination HIV prevention and treatment
research that transcends individual models, including but not limited to implementation science; (2)
Networking: To connect scientists across disciplines and across networks with complementary expertise and
community partners to bi-directionally inform available research tools and identify need for advances in analytic
methodologies; and (3) Capacity building: To recruit, mentor, and support high-caliber investigators with
methods expertise and disseminate innovative methods, assessment tools, and platforms through in-person
and virtual training activities with emphasis to emerging scientists from underrepresented minorities in science.
The Methods Core is guided by a broad causal-inference paradigm to maintain a scientific foundation in all
research activities and in evaluating potential impacts. The Methods Core will prioritize three areas: (a)
Harmonizing evidence across multiple data sources; (b) Statistical methods for complex applied contexts
including management of high-dimensional measurements, of varying data types, of missing data, and of other
complexities in HIV prevention research; (c) Dissemination and implementation science consultations utilizing
participatory approaches, balancing fidelity and adaptation, identifying core elements, modeling decision-
making in intervention adoption, and applying system-analytical tools. In housing the “UCLA Rapid, Rigorous,
Relevant Implementation Science Hub”, the core further expands its capacity to support and guide

10755348,"ABSTRACT – POLICY IMPACT CORE
The Policy Impact Core supports the CHIPTS mission by promoting policy-relevant research, training, and
dissemination activities that address mental health and substance use disorders, social and structural
determinants of health (hereafter “comorbidities”), and health disparities among people living with or at
elevated risk for HIV. The core aims to leverage policy to address issues and to translate scientific advances
into actionable policy items; activities that impact the gaps between targets and outcomes that can be
attributed to systemic inequities linked with comorbidities. The core uses data and scientific findings to highlight
systemic disparities in HIV prevention and treatment outcomes across racial/ethnic, sexual orientation, gender,
and mental health/substance use disorder groups that are overrepresented among socioeconomically
disadvantaged populations. Focusing on populations made vulnerable by changes to health policy,
experiences that lead to medical mistrust and over engagement with the criminal justice system, the core
contributes to CHIPTS research themes and stewards policy-level change in response to new developments in
science, policy, and practice towards equitable ends. Through elevating community-informed research
addressing factors that negatively and disproportionately affect Black, Latinx, and Native American populations
with comorbidities, the core supports efforts to use policy to increase access and equitable opportunities for
combination HIV prevention and treatment. These points illustrate the unique perspective and focus the core
brings to the overall center. The specific aims are: (1) Science: To promote and evaluate policy change in
response to scientific research that addresses barriers and facilitators to equitable dissemination and
implementation of emerging innovations, especially regarding HIV-related disparities and people with or at risk
for HIV with comorbidities and/or criminal justice system involvement; (2) Networking: To develop, strengthen,
and maintain channels of communication with policy makers, community stakeholders, investigators, and state
and local public health entities; and (3) Capacity Building: To build the capacity of investigators, including
domestic and international partners, to implement and evaluate evidence-based policies that aim to increase
contributions of emerging innovations to end the HIV epidemic. The core works to promote policy-relevant
research, training, and dissemination that address mental health and substance use disorders, social and
structural determinants of health, and health disparities among people living with or at high risk for HIV. The
gap between targets and outcomes can be attributed to systemic inequities in social determinants of health."

engaging investigators and community stakeholders; and (3) Capacity building: To build capacity within
affected communities, key stakeholders, and service organizations through community education and
workforce training; to mentor emerging scientists and faculty on the development, testing and evaluation of
combination prevention approaches; to facilitate linkages between community members interested in HIV
therapeutics or prevention with ongoing research opportunities."
10842329,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Stress leads to the enhancement of memory in both humans and animals. This stress-enhanced memory has
relevance to stress-related psychiatric disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is marked
by heightened, perseverant memories of trauma. Interestingly, only approximately 10-20% of people develop
the enduring symptoms of PTSD, despite nearly everyone experiencing at least one traumatic event in their
lifetime. In addition, rates of PTSD are higher among women and military personnel. A protocol was developed
by this group that results in differential susceptibility to stress enhancement of a remote (one month old) fear
memory among male mice and a greater propensity for enhancement in females. Despite the clear importance
of understanding the mechanisms supporting long-lasting, perseverant memory, the majority of basic memory
research focuses on recent (~ 1 day old), not remote memory and does not incorporate a stress component.
Additional research performed by the group with this protocol identified the basolateral amygdala (BLA) has a
critical hub mediating stress-enhanced fear memory and the associated differential susceptibility. The primary
goal of the current application is to delineate how stress engages and alters the function of the BLA to drive
differential susceptibility to stress-enhanced fear memory. The work will place particular focus on sex as a
biological variable and lateralized function of the BLA. Regarding the latter, the right hemisphere BLA is
associated with negative valence, while the left is associated with positive valence. This is conserved from
humans to rodents but is understudied in basic research. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that stress
leads to lasting impacts on the BLA, resulting in differential susceptibility to remote stress-enhanced fear
memory. The working hypothesis to be explored is that an intense acute stressor alters subsequent fear memory
strength by influencing the recruitment of specific BLA cell populations to the memory trace. Work leading up to
this proposal (F99 Aim 1A) details studies characterizing identity and laterality of neural ensembles supporting
stress-induced memory enhancement. To examine how stress impacts experience coding to influence stress-
enhanced fear memory (F99 Aim 1B), I will train in execution and data analysis of in vivo calcium imaging of the
BLA. In transitioning to a postdoctoral fellowship, I will focus on research based on the high rate of co-morbidity
between stress disorders and alcohol and substance sue disorders (K00). The research will incorporate
neurophysiological and deep sequencing measures to further study how stress individually impacts function of
the BLA and associated circuitry to influence alcohol or drug seeking. The proposed work will provide a much-
needed, deep characterization of the impact of stress on the brain in the context of differential stress
susceptibility. This information will then be used to guide cellular, molecular and circuit level mechanistic studies,
with the goal of identifying therapeutic strategies."

Broad, Long-Term Objectives. Oral diseases and disorders in and of themselves affect health and well-being throughout
life. Research is key to improving oral health, eliminating health disparities, and further reducing the burden of oral
diseases and disorders. Unfortunately, a wide gap exists between biomedical research and clinical practice. While
scientists constantly produce new knowledge relevant to oral disease prevention and clinical care, much of their work is
never incorporated into practice. Similarly, clinical problems are rarely translated into research questions and projects.
In addition, there have been growing concerns about the reduction in the clinician-scientist workforce, which may
impact oral health scientific contributions as well as the pipeline of future oral health leaders. The goal of the Pacific-
Stanford PRIMED Program is to train the next generation of clinical oral health researchers to effectively translate
biomedical research to ensure optimal oral and general health outcomes.
The specific aims and objectives of this program are to:
 1. Provide personalized education in clinical research skills development for clinically-oriented faculty, dental
 alumni, and dental students/residents by leveraging resources through the Stanford CTSA program.
 2. Engage and support research faculty and clinically-oriented faculty in intra- and inter-institutional collaborations
 at UOP and Stanford.
 3. Create peer and student mentoring partnerships with bidirectional research partnerships between research
 faculty, clinically-oriented faculty, and dental students/residents at UOP and Stanford.
 4. To carry out practice-based clinical research conducted in UOP and affiliated dental clinics with clinical faculty
 and students/residents participating in research conducted during the course of patient care.
We will accomplish these goals by: (1) providing clinical research education for clinically-oriented faculty, dental alumni,
and dental students/residents by leveraging Stanford CTSA program resources; (2) supporting research and clinically-
oriented faculty in bidirectional intra- and inter-institutional collaborations at UOP and Stanford; (3) creating mentoring
partnerships between research and clinically-oriented faculty, and dental students/residents at UOP and Stanford; and

10756082,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a widely used technology for non-invasive modulation of human
brain activity. TMS induces electric fields (E-fields) in the intracranial tissue by means of time-varying magnetic
fields (electromagnetic induction) that results in the possibility of obtaining suprathreshold stimulation
intensities safely and with little discomfort to the subjects. Clinical applications of TMS include major
depressive disorder (MDD) and treatment resistant depression (TRD) in which repetitive TMS (rTMS) is
administered to Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) with well-demonstrated efficacy. Both in clinical and
basic neuroscience research applications, it is important that the stimulation is accurately targeted to the
desired region(s). The E-field distribution that is induced by the TMS pulse in the intracranial tissue is the key
physical quantity that can be used to delineate which areas are stimulated and which are not. This is especially
important for non-motor regions such as the DLPFC because a direct peripheral measure (e.g.,
electromyographic response) cannot be used to guide the stimulation. To date, computationally estimated E-
field distributions have been used in “online” commercial neuronavigation systems to guide the TMS coil
positioning, but the currently available systems offer only spherically symmetric head models that cannot
properly take into account the individual differences in tissue geometries and may result in substantial targeting
and dosing errors. On the other hand, the most accurate computational methods for E-field estimation are too
slow to enable near real time operation. Therefore, no technique exists that has the computational efficiency to
enable neuronavigation applications while at the same time incorporating high level of anatomical detail and
numerical accuracy. To remove this efficiency vs. accuracy dilemma that is currently posing a critical barrier for
development of more quantitative TMS approaches, we propose to use our recently developed Boundary
Element Method (BEM) based computational strategy accelerated by the Fast Multipole Method (FMM) that is
suitable for both online and offline application scenarios. Our approach starts with developing an automatic
segmentation and surface generation pipeline to obtain accurate representations of the tissue conductivity
boundaries using individual MRI data. We will subsequently develop and experimental TMS neuronavigation
system that utilizes the fast BEM-FMM method. The purpose of this system is to render the E-field distributions
on top of the 3D brain anatomy and to guide the operator to position the TMS coil and associated E-field “hot
spot” to the desired location. We will interface the computational engine with a commercial TMS navigator to
demonstrate translational potential for clinical research and ultimately to therapeutic/clinical applications.
Finally, we will validate the computational neuronavigation accuracy with an anthropomorphic head phantom
and evaluate our system in healthy volunteers and in volunteer neurosurgical patients that are scheduled for
invasive direct cortical mapping that will be used as a gold standard."

10974020,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The processes that drive bacterial cell division should be prime targets for the design of novel
antibiotics, but our understanding of how one bacterium becomes two is riddled with significant gaps that
prevent its exploitation. Nearly all bacteria possess the same five-protein complex (FtsQLB-WI) to coordinate
the synthesis of a peptidoglycan (PG) septum between dividing cells. Our laboratory has extensive experience
with the purification and modification of lipid-bound PG precursors for the reconstitution of PG synthesis in
vitro, and, we have intimate knowledge of this specific PG synthesis complex as we were the first to
characterize FtsW as a PG glycosyltransferase. We are therefore uniquely poised to resolve the mechanism by
which pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae regulate the synthesis of PG during division. In Aim 1, I
will generate a structure of the synthase enzyme subcomplex, FtsW and FtsI, bound to PG precursor
substrate. FtsW is a novel member of the SEDS-family, and this structure will be the first to define how FtsW
binds PG precursors and suggest a mechanism of action. We have already reconstituted the PG synthase
activity of S. pneumoniae FtsWI in vitro and found that addition of FtsQLB is inhibitory. We hypothesize that
both protein-protein and substrate interactions are required for de-repression of the FtsQLB-WI complex. In
Aim 2, I will explore protein factors that regulate FtsWI synthase activity, including a systematic identification of
domains within the non-enzymatic subcomplex FtsQLB that are required for FtsWI regulation, as well as in vivo
co-immunoprecipitation assays against FtsQLB-WI to identify additional components required for FtsQLB-WI
de-repression. In Aim 3, I will isolate components of the peptidoglycan cell wall predicted to bind regulatory
domains within FtsQLB-WI to determine their influence on the activity of FtsQLB-WI in vitro. Together, these
aims will generate a comprehensive model of septal PG synthesis in S. pneumoniae that can inform the design
of novel antibiotics.
 The work proposed here will not only grant me the expertise in biochemistry I require to become an
independent researcher, but additionally place me in proximity to other important means of professional
development. At Harvard Medical School and in the Boston area, I will have ample access to teaching and
mentoring experiences in preparation for a career in higher education. I will also foster collaborative
professional relationships within my HMS community as well as the broader microbiology and undergraduate
educator community. As a postdoctoral fellow under Dr. Suzanne Walker at HMS, I will develop the skills I
require to be a well-rounded microbiology researcher and educator at an undergraduate institution."
10746388,"Falls are a leading cause of injurious death and non-fatal injuries in older adults. While fall prevention is a major
VA initiative, the current best fall preventions program only reduces falls by ~30% suggesting further research
and interventions are needed to reduce fall risk. Decreased lower extremity muscle mass and strength
contribute to balance and mobility limitations. Our recent studies show the hip abductors have a unique role in
balance and mobility function. Older adults with impaired hip abductor muscles demonstrate decreased hip
abductor strength, lower balance scores, and poor stepping mechanics when recovering from a balance
perturbation. Our preliminary results also show increased fatty infiltration of the hip abductor muscles may
contribute to poor muscle recruitment and make changing the hip abductor muscles with a traditional strength
intervention difficult. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation is one method to improve muscles in older adults,
though it is not traditionally used on the hip abductors.
Our preliminary results demonstrate that older adults who use neuromuscular electrical stimulation on their hip
abductors, in conjunction with a balance training intervention; demonstrate larger improvements in hip abductor
strength, balance, and mobility function. Our central hypothesis is that the addition of neuromuscular electrical
stimulation applied to the hip abductors during a balance intervention will result in: improved balance, larger
improvements in muscle and mobility function, and fewer falls than a balance intervention alone. In this
randomized control trial, we will determine the effects of a balance and strengthening program with and without
neuromuscular electrical stimulation on fall risk and mobility (aim 1), changes in hip abductor composition,
function, activation and gait variability (aim 2), and the retention of these changes at a six and twelve-month
follow up (aim 3). We anticipate that this patient-oriented translational research will provide the first evidence
from a large randomized control trial for the use of neuromuscular electrical stimulation applied to the primary hip
abductors as an efficacious adjunct to traditional rehabilitation programs to improve balance, mobility, and
muscle in older Veterans at risk for falls."

In chronic kidney disease (CKD), hyperphosphatemia and increased fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) levels
are associated with faster CKD progression, cardiovascular events and death. Novel therapeutic approaches to
limit the effects of excess FGF23 and phosphate (Pi), slow CKD progression and prevent adverse outcomes are
desperately needed. In preliminary data for this project, chronic administration of FGF23 or dietary Pi
supplementation that further increased FGF23 levels in mice with CKD, accelerate CKD progression. In addition,
we show that FGF23 and Pi are powerful regulators of circadian rhythms in the kidney. Impaired circadian
rhythms, or chronodisruption, is an established feature of CKD, but the factors contributing to altered expression
of kidney clock genes, and the consequences on kidney function and mortality remain unclear. FGF23 and Pi
activate FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1), increase early growth response protein 1 (EGR1) activation and stimulate
nuclear factor κB (NFκB), an established inhibitor of the repressor arm of the core molecular clock. We show
that administration of an FGFR1 inhibitor in FGF23-treated kidney cells and in mice with CKD reduces EGR1
expression and corrects the expression of clock genes in the kidney. Importantly, we show that FGFR1 inhibitor
improved kidney function in mice with CKD. In this innovative proposal, we will test the hypothesis that increased
FGF23 and Pi accelerate CKD progression through disruption of the kidney circadian clock, and that this process
is mediated by FGFR1.
In Aim 1, we will define the combined and individual roles of FGF23 and Pi on kidney function and identify their
kidney-specific molecular targets. We will use low and high dietary Pi administration, FGF23 administration and
bone-specific Fgf23 deletion in the wild-type (WT) and Col4a3KO mouse model of progressive CKD. In Aim 2,
we will assess the role of EGR1 and NFκB in mediating the effects of FGF23 and Pi on the kidney molecular
clock. We will use genetic and pharmacological approaches to modulate EGR1 and NFκB signaling, and assess
transcriptional oscillations of kidney clock genes in models of acute and chronic FGF23 and Pi excess. We will
identify kidney-specific gene targets using EGR1 and NFκB ChIP sequencing. In Aim 3, we will demonstrate
the contribution of increased Bmal1, one of the main core clock activators, to impaired kidney function using
genetic approaches to lower kidney Bmal1 expression in WT and Co4a3KO mice. We will also use genetic and
pharmacologic blockade of FGFR1 in mice with CKD to demonstrate its therapeutic potential to prevent FGF23
and Pi induced inflammation on the kidney and restore kidney circadian rhythms. We will assess amelioration
of lifespan, markers of mineral metabolism and kidney morphology and function. These innovative aims are
supported by a productive collaborative team with expertise, skills and resources at Northwestern University that
will further develop our understanding of FGF23 and Pi function, and support our ultimate goal of developing
novel therapies to improve CKD-associated outcomes."

Exposure of human populations to arsenic via drinking water, air, and food is associated with significant
morbidity and mortality. Along with impairments in immune function, an increased susceptibility to pneumonia
has been observed in children exposed to high levels of arsenic. Pneumonia is a major global health concern
accounting for 70% of pediatric hospitalizations in the US alone. Epidemiological studies indicate a decrease in
the efficacy of respiratory vaccines in arsenic-exposed children. While vaccine efficacy is largely dependent on
host immune function, recent evidence indicates that the gut microbiome may also play a role. However, the
interrelationship of immune function and the microbiome on vaccine response in arsenic-exposed children has
not been studied. It is likely that early exposures to arsenic compromise vaccines protecting against
Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most common bacterial cause of pneumonia. The Scientific Premise is that
Early life and in utero arsenic exposure in children leads to alterations in adaptive immunity via dysregulation of
lymphocyte development and function. The impairment in these immune cells is responsible for decreases in
protection from upper airway infections (such as S. pneumoniae) due to decreased vaccine PCV10 efficacy, as
measured by S. pneumoniae nasopharyngeal (NP) carriage and anti-PCV circulating antibody titers. We also
posit that arsenic disrupts the gut microbiome which may alter vaccine efficacy, due to altered adaptive T cell
development. In Aim 1, we test the hypothesis that arsenic exposure in utero and during early life in children
(1-2 year) leads to (a) impaired PCV10 antibody responses following a booster dose of PCV10, and (b)
influences the NP microbiota diversity and the S. pneumoniae carriage. We will measure PCV10 titers and NP
carriage using qRT-PCR and full length 16s rRNA sequencing. In Aim 2, we test the hypothesis that alterations
in immune function and development are associated with early life arsenic exposure, leading to compromised
host immunity. These measures include PBMC immune biomarkers and functional immune assays including:
a) cell surface markers (CSM = T, B, NK, monocyte/dendritic cells, memory effector T cells) and the Th cell
subsets (Th1, Th2, Th4, Th17, Treg) using 11-color flow cytometry; b) T cell proliferation; c) ex vivo cytokine
production. In Aim 3 we test the hypothesis that differences in functional gut microbial composition are
influenced by immune development and immune function. We will assess the gut bacterial microbiome by
shotgun metagenomics and correlations with; a) PCV10 titers and the pneumococcal carriage (Aim1) and b)
changes in immune markers/function (Aim 2). The study will be conducted among 400 children in Bangladesh
ages between 1 and 2 years. Mothers of the participating children are part of a birth cohort and are followed
throughout their pregnancy, and children are extremely well characterized for arsenic exposure in utero. These
studies will provide new evidence on altered PCV vaccine response and the importance of the gut microbiome
in adverse health outcomes associated with arsenic."

The Asian population in the U.S. has nearly doubled since the year 2000. Overall, 6.5% of births in the U.S. are
to Asian people, yet a recently published ECHO Cohort analysis of pregnancies indicated that only 5.0% of the
nearly 22,000 pregnancies included were to Asian people, representing just over 1,000 pregnant Asians. Despite
efforts to be inclusive at enrollment across individual cohorts, the ECHO Cohort may include too few pregnant
people of this underrepresented minority group to allow for meaningful examination of important race-related
associations. Concerns about insufficient statistical power are heightened when analyses require disaggregation
of data by Asian ethnicity due to heterogeneous risks. This proposal aims to increase the power and significance
of the ECHO Cohort by enrolling an additional 780 pregnant Asian people representing multiple Asian ethnic
groups from the three largest healthcare systems in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area, along with their
conceiving partners and the index infant. Our institutional expertise supports our focus on physical & chemical
and lifestyle measures for our Specialized Exposures, and obesity as our Specialized Outcome. This study will
allow us to further examine environmental health disparities among Asians, particularly among Southeast Asians
such at the Hmong, who overwhelmingly represent the largest Asian ethnicity in Minnesota. For example,
reproductive-aged Hmong women have been found to have significantly higher levels of certain phthalate
metabolites compared to NHANES averages; given the documented effects of phthalates on fetal development,
this is particularly concerning because Hmong women are roughly twice as likely to have had a birth in the last
year compared to all other women. Our scientific aims will investigate the role of phthalates on sexually dimorphic
outcomes including body composition in Asian ECHO Cohort participants. Our operational aim will use the
exceptional performance of our research team during the first seven years of the ECHO Cohort to enroll multi-
ethnic Asian participants. We will employ a novel recruitment methodology that transcends healthcare systems
and that will identify a pregnant person at their first prenatal visit, then allowing research professionals from their
own healthcare institution to recruit for our cohort. Upon enrollment, our study team will coordinate effortless
biospecimen collection from their routine prenatal visits (and during delivery), while providing in-person (remote
when necessary) study visits at our conveniently located Epidemiology Clinical Research Center; we will retain
our Asian families using community-engaged approaches. Children resulting from the pregnancy, and the
conceiving partner, will also be enrolled. 117 (15%) of these once-pregnant Asian people who may become
pregnant again, along with their conceiving partners, will be re-enrolled into the ECHO Pre-Conception Pilot.
This unprecedented collaboration of healthcare systems will leverage our previous successes within the ECHO
Cohort and provide valuable environmental health data to improve the health of Asian American communities."

Telomeres are protective noncoding DNA caps at the ends of chromosomes that maintain genomic integrity. In
most somatic tissues telomeres will shorten with successive rounds of replication and will reach a critically short
length, at which point a cell will become senescent or undergo apoptosis. This fate can be avoided if telomeres
are maintained through expression of telomerase, a reverse transcriptase that elongates telomeres by adding
telomeric repeats. This elongation of telomeres can lead to replicative immortality, one of the hallmarks of cancer.
Another hallmark of cancer is genomic instability that arises from DNA damage. The most prevalent form of DNA
damage are ribonucleotides (rNTPs) inserted during DNA replication. Left unrepaired these rNTPs will promote
genomic instability, changes to the DNA secondary structure, and human diseases. Given the deleterious effects
of rNTPs in DNA, cells have evolved the ribonucleotide excision repair (RER) pathway to remove rNTPs. While
the impact of rNTPs in the genome is well established to have deleterious effects and promote human disease,
the impact of rNTPs at telomeres remains unknown. One essential DNA secondary structure seen at telomeres,
that can be affected by rNTPs, is a G-quadruplex (G4). Specific to this proposal, it is not known what effect
rNTPs will have on telomeric structure and integrity, or how rNTPs at telomeres are repaired to protect telomere
integrity. To investigate this, we have developed a telomerase mutant (Y717A) that inserts rNTPs at a greater
rate than wildtype (WT) telomerase. Using this mutant, I will selectively increase the rate of rNTP incorporation
only at telomeres. The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine the effect of rNTPs on telomeric G4s
and characterize the repair pathway for rNTPs in telomeres. I hypothesize that rNTP insertion into telomeres will
alter telomeric G4 dynamics and that these rNTPs are repaired through RER. To test this hypothesis, I propose
the following specific aims: 1) characterize the structural effects of rNTP insertion into telomeres and 2)
characterize rNTP repair in telomeres. For aim 1, I will use circular dichroism spectrophotometry to systematically
examine G4 formation in vitro. Using oligos of the basic telomeric sequence that will form a G4 (TTAGGG)4, I
will systematically replace the dNTPs with rNTPs to determine if rNTPs alter the key G4 structural motif in
telomeres. Additionally, using cell lines that contain either WT telomerase or a telomerase mutant which inserts
rNTPs at a greater rate than WT in conjunction with antibodies that are specific for G4s to examine if the presence
of rNTPs alters the G4 content at telomeres. For aim 2, I will characterize RER by reconstituting the RER pathway
with a substrate that has a single rNTP that will either be linear DNA or DNA folded into a G4. I will monitor the
formation of the repaired product and compare RER functionality on the different substrates. Additionally, using
proximity dependent biotin identification (BioID) I will be able to identify any additional proteins that are involved
in repair of rNTPs at telomeres. This study applies an innovative combination of in vitro biochemical assays with
cellular assays to examine the impact and repair of rNTPs at telomeres."

Inflammation is an evolutionarily conserved reaction with both beneficial and detrimental impacts on health.
Excessive and prolonged inflammatory responses can promote damage to host tissues and contribute to
numerous chronic human diseases while inadequate inflammation promotes susceptibility to infection. It is still
not clear how the balance of these pro-and anti-inflammatory factors is determined and thus why inflammation
persists and becomes chronic in some contexts, but not others. Due to the antimicrobial effects of inflammation,
microbes have evolved strategies to interfere with the inflammatory response. Our published and preliminary
studies have provided evidence that a secreted Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) virulence-promoting protein (p60)
specifically targets the cDC1 subset of dendritic cells to promote the production of IL-10 by NK cells. IL-10 is a
cytokine important for resolution of inflammation. Our proposed studies will dissect the mechanisms by which a
specific domain present in p60 as well as proteins from numerous other bacteria acts to induce this response.
Specifically, we investigate how newly identified receptors promote the response to p60, how p60 acts once in
the cell, and unique features of p60 that support it ability to manipulate immune responses."
10752690,"Despite rigorous investigations and the expenditure of nearly 6% of Medicare funds on their care, annual
mortality among the 511,000 dialysis patients in the United States is extraordinarily high. Approximately, 17%
of patients die annually with half of deaths attributable to cardiovascular (CV) causes, particularly sudden
cardiac death. Current therapies do not effectively lower CV mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients thus
highlighting the importance of addressing existing gaps in understanding of the mechanisms underlying CV
complications in HD patients and identifying novel therapeutic targets. Transient intra-dialytic myocardial
stunning (IdMS) during HD—the dominant dialysis modality in the US—has been increasingly implicated as
one such mechanism potentially responsible for progressive myocardial damage and subsequent development
of heart failure, arrhythmia, and CV death. However, current understanding of this novel risk factor is woefully
incomplete. Prior studies were small, included few women, non-white, or incident patients—those with the
highest risk of CV death—and variation in estimated prevalence was extreme (20-100%). In addition, studies of
IdMS risk factors were underpowered and conflicting, and it is remains unknown whether IdMS occurs
intermittently or repetitively. Finally, although our both our own preliminary data and studies by other groups
implicate a potential role for autonomic dysfunction in IdMS pathophysiology, there have been few mechanistic
investigations and understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is incomplete.
In short, IdMS is a potentially important and treatable contributor to CV death in the HD population, but there
are major gaps in understanding its epidemiology, risk factors, and mechanisms. We propose studies designed
to address these critical knowledge gaps and provide the necessary information to determine whether and how
IdMS should be targeted to reduce CV mortality in HD: In Aim 1, we propose performing intradialytic
echocardiography on a large, diverse cohort of 400 incident HD patients to facilitate stable, generalizable
estimates of IdMS prevalence, the analysis of important subgroups, and the study of associations with key risk
factors. In Aim 2, we propose a comprehensive investigation of the hypothesis that unopposed surges in
sympathetic tone underlie susceptibility to IdMS. Myocardial 11C-hydroxephderine PET scanning and dedicated
studies in an autonomic function lab will be utilized to assess systematic and myocardial-specific autonomic
function. Conversely, intradialytic autonomic tone and circulating hormones will be measured during dialysis to
systematically define the patterns of change in autonomic tone preceding and predisposing to episodes of
IdMS. These studies will improve understanding of the epidemiology and physiology of a potentially critical
contributor to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the dialysis population, improve basic understanding of
the pathophysiologic impact of HD on the heart, and provide the necessary data to design targeted
therapeutics to reduce CV death for high-risk patients."

The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key brain region which encodes responses to both natural and drug
reinforcers. All drugs of abuse are known to increase the dopaminergic tone in the NAc, making it a central brain
structure in coordinating drug response. Drugs of abuse act largely through synaptic targets to alter intracellular
signaling cascades which leads to the activation or inhibition of transcription factors, which in turn induce or
repress the expression of specific genes. These drug-induced functions of brain transcription factors are
sensitive to, and contribute to, the epigenetic landscape within a neuron and have been associated with lasting
alterations in neuronal function and drug-related behaviors. Therefore, understanding the drug-induced function
of transcription factors in this brain area may expand our understanding of how drugs of abuse can coordinate
lasting changes in drug-related behaviors. This knowledge is critical for the development of the next generation
of specific substance use disorder (SUD) medications. Here, I propose innovation centered on synthetic biology
approaches to re-program the function of transcription factors, for viral delivery in the brain of awake and
behaving mice, to resolve the exact, damaging transcription factor functions that are distinct to stimulant versus
opioid addiction. I propose to accomplish this by applying novel synthetic transcription factor constructs
combined with brain transcriptome profiling and drug self-administration procedures. This project focuses on
ZFP189, a novel drug-activated transcription factor that I have carefully characterized in my earlier graduate
work. First, in the NAc, I will virally deliver synthetic ZFP189 transcription factors, which possess artificial
functional moieties capable of exerting distinct forms of transcriptional control at all in vivo target genes. I will
perform RNA sequencing approaches to uncover how the complete gene-regulatory functions of a ZFP189 are
differentially engaged in the context of stimulant versus opioid use. Second, I will utilize these same synthetic
ZFP189 transcription factors to investigate their causal contributions to drug reinforcement using intravenous
drug self-administration procedures. By innovating the application of synthetic transcription factors that can be
programmed to exert novel forms of gene regulation across the genome, these techniques can be combined
with existing RNA sequencing and complex behavioral procedures to serve as tools for both molecular
interrogation into the transcription factor functions distinct to specific drugs of abuse and as highly specific
transcription manipulations to uncover the causal gene regulatory events that drive certain SUDs. Together, this
work will provide new approaches to identify the transcription factor functions at the core of specific SUDs and
yield refined gene candidates as targets for future SUD medications."

Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is rapidly increasing in children infected with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
According to our preliminary data, 1 in 30 children infected with HIV between the age of 16 and 19 are
diagnosed with MetS. In addition, to MetS, tuberculosis (TB) remains a leading cause of morbidity and
mortality among HIV-infected children. Moreover, children with HIV have a 30-fold risk of developing TB and
a significantly higher risk of death compared to non-HIV-infected children. Clinically, TB in HIV-infected
children manifests with extensive heterogeneity (latent TB or active TB [probable, definite, or possible]), which
poses a significant diagnostic challenge. The paucibacillary nature of pediatric TB means that only a small
fraction of children with a compatible clinical presentation can be bacteriologically confirmed. There have
been various efforts to develop data science tools to address patient classification and risk stratification of
MetS and improve the diagnosis of TB in adult Western populations. However, these technologies have not
been deployed and evaluated in Africa, which bears the biggest burden of people infected with HIV and TB
and where the burden of non-communicable diseases is growing rapidly.
Furthermore, MetS is a known risk factor for the early development of diabetes mellitus (DM) and
cardiovascular disease (CVD) in adulthood. Unfortunately, interventions (either pharmacological or non-
pharmacological) that improve metabolic risk factors for children with long-term metabolic impairment (MetS)
do not completely prevent or reverse CVD or DM complications, which may be the result of the current timing
of interventions which are implemented after metabolic risk factors have been present for many years. Thus,
the determination of the longitudinal risk of MetS becomes imperative.
Similarly, the availability of multi-omics data presents a valuable opportunity to investigate the host genetics
of TB disease in SSA children to advance the development of highly sensitive TB diagnostic algorithms that
are much needed. Therefore, the overarching goal of this application is to utilize data science approaches to
integrate large temporal electronic health records (EHR) with multi-omics data to predict and improve health
outcomes of HIV-infected children in Africa. This retrospective, descriptive longitudinal study will leverage
existing data on ~118,000 HIV-infected children from the Baylor International Pediatric AIDS Initiative (BIPAI)
programs in Uganda, Botswana and Eswatini. In Aim 1, we will use machine learning to identify informative
features within longitudinal EHRs and genomic data to predict MetS in HIV-infected children. We shall also
develop composite risk scores for the development of MetS associated with dolutegravir-based combination
antiretroviral therapy. Aim 2 of this proposal will focus on the use of explainable machine learning to uncover
molecular signatures in multi-omics data as well as characteristic features in temporal EHR that improve the
power of predictive models for the diagnosis of TB in HIV-infected children. This effort will translate into
developing clinically relevant composite risk scores for the diagnosis of TB and the future development and
validation of non-sputum TB diagnostic biomarkers. This application provides a model methodological
framework that can be applied to multimodal data in HIV-infected children and improves our understanding
of how to effectively use artificial intelligence to target personalized or public health interventions that improve
outcomes across the entire spectrum of the HIV continuum care in Africa."

Subretinal fibrosis underlies the end-stage pathogenesis of several retinal diseases including age-
related macular degeneration (AMD) and proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). Fibrosis results
from neovascularization or injuries and is part of the wound healing response characterized by
the formation of excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) connective tissue.
Subretinal fibrosis can generate contractile force, cause scar formation, massive subretinal
hemorrhage, and retinal detachment, therefore disrupting retinal structures and eventually leading
to legal blindness. The cellular and molecular mechanism of subretinal fibrosis is still unclear, and
the clinical treatment for this condition is very limited. Myofibroblast is a predominant cell type that
are critically involved in fibrosis. The cellular contribution to myofibroblasts is diverse and
heterogenous, with multiple cell types involved. For example, RPE cells contribute to fibrosis
through epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), endothelial cells contribute to fibrosis through
endothelial-mesenchymal transition (endMT), and macrophages contribute to fibrosis through
macrophage-mesenchymal transition (MMT). To fully understand the mechanism of subretinal
fibrosis, the role of myofibroblast and the contribution of different cell-types to subretinal fibrosis
need to be resolved. MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) are endogenous small molecules which can
regulate diverse pathways in different cell types. Several miRNAs, including miR-29, miR-24, and
miR-21 have been associated with fibrosis. Our preliminary data showed that miR-24
overexpression inhibits EMT, endMT and fibrosis by regulating TGF-β/SMAD3 and LIMK2/MRTF
pathways, suggesting miR-24 could serve as an ideal therapeutic target for subretinal fibrosis by
targeting two major pathways in different cell types. The broad goal of this proposal is to elucidate
the cellular contribution, identity and function of myofibroblasts in subretinal fibrosis and test the
therapeutic potential of miR-24 in subretinal fibrosis. We hypothesize that: (1) myofibroblasts
from multiple cell lineages could contribute to subretinal fibrosis; and (2) miR-24, can repress
EMT, endoMT and MMT by regulating TGF-β/SMAD3 and LIMK2/MRTF pathways, therefore
representing an excellent “one drug/multiple targets” model for treating subretinal fibrosis in AMD
and PVR. Two Aims will be pursued: Aim I is to define the function, identity, and origin of
myofibroblasts in subretinal fibrosis; and Aim II is to determine the therapeutic potential
of miR-24 in subretinal fibrosis. Successful completion of the proposed project will pave the
way to study the mechanism and therapeutics of subretinal fibrosis in human AMD and PVR
patients."

The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) Maternal Health Research Center of Excellence (Center) will
effectively contribute to eliminating maternal morbidity and mortality by taking a system-level approach to
addressing maternal health inequity. The Center convenes investigators and leaders from diverse disciplines
and embodies decades of maternal health expertise in research, education, and community partnership,
including several pioneers in the field of maternal health. The overall goal of the Center is to advance maternal
health research by examining the mechanisms by which structural inequity contributes to maternal health
disparities and to develop innovative clinical strategies to prevent maternal mortality (MM), reduce severe
maternal morbidity (SMM), and promote maternal health equity in partnership with communities. We will move
away from a focus on individual outcomes and contributors to inequality and focus on studying ways to
leverage systems for large-scale impact. The theme of the Center is to Synergize Multilevel Systems of
Change for maternal health equity. The Specific aims include:
Aim 1. Conduct robust interprofessional research on maternal health equity, using a multilevel approach, with
the goal of decreasing preventable maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity, and promote maternal
health equity among women that experience persistent disparities.
Aim 2. Serve as a hub for maternal health career development and work-force training for early-stage
investigators interested in research training.
Aim 3. Disseminate effective strategies for improving comprehensive postpartum care and innovative research
methods to address maternal health inequalities.
Aim 4. Serve as a research resource and build a repository of maternal health data (biological, clinical, survey,
neighborhood) broadly available for use by researchers.
Aim 5. Facilitate and strengthen community partnerships to support the development of, and engagement in,
scholarship, dissemination, and translation of maternal health research.
The UIC Maternal Health Research Center of Excellence consists of three Cores: Research, Community
Partnership, and Training. We propose three complimentary projects: 1) Multilevel exposure to adversity
across the life-course; 2) Multilevel predictive modeling for maternal health equity; and 3) Implementing a novel
model of postpartum care to improve outcomes in rural and urban community sites (prospective intervention)."
10748094,"ABSTRACT – PROJECT 1.
In concert with the University of Illinois Chicago Maternal Health Research Center of Excellence (Center)
theme to Synergize Systems of Change for Maternal Health Equity, this project aims to characterize how
structural racism impacts postpartum women’s health. Black women bear a disproportionate burden of
death and are nearly three times as likely to die within one year of pregnancy as White women. Nationally and
in Illinois, almost 70% of pregnancy-associated deaths occur postpartum, making this a particularly sensitive
period. Women in Chicago have more than two times higher rates of severe maternal morbidity compared to
other geographical locations in Illinois. Postpartum women living in Chicago are disparately exposed to
structural racism and adverse social and physical conditions. Chronic exposure to structural racism, including
neighborhood living conditions such as racial residential segregation, concentrated disadvantage, and violence
play an important role in producing and maintaining health disparities and socio-economic disadvantage. Yet,
most maternal health research focuses on individual-level risk factors. This project will fill that gap in
knowledge by examining the broader contextual experiences of postpartum women. The aims of this project
are to: 1) describe the exposure to multilevel (neighborhood, family, and individual) adverse risk factors among
urban postpartum women, 2) assess the effect of multilevel (neighborhood, family, and individual) exposures
on bio-physical outcomes among urban postpartum women, and 3) understand multilevel (neighborhood,
family, and individual) context of daily experience across the life-course of postpartum women using qualitative
photovoice methods. These studies will identify molecular indicators of maternal health outcomes to pinpoint
neighborhood characteristics that trigger/exacerbate biological pathways resulting in maternal health
disparities. This project also will develop new knowledge about women's lived experiences and the impact of
structural racism that can inform the design of relevant and meaningful interventions for this population. Data
collected from this project will be managed by the Center Data Committee and uploaded to Center Research
Resource & Data Repository. This project will rely on the Community Partnership Core and Community
Advisory Board to integrate the voice of the community which is integral to maternal health equity research.
This project will be linked to Project 3, the prospective intervention study, by providing information about the
needs of postpartum women. This project also will serve as an opportunity for trainees in the Training Core to
gain valuable research experience in public health, social work, data science, and biology."

The UIC Maternal Health Research Center of Excellence Community Partnership Core (CPC) will address the
critical need for a structured, systemic approach to engage communities in research to address disparities in
maternal health outcomes. The Center expands on existing partnerships with EverThrive Illinois and
AllianceChicago to create a multi-sector coalition working together toward a common goal of improving
maternal outcomes for families in Chicago. EverThrive will convene a statewide Community Advisory Board
(CAB) that is representative of the diverse communities across Illinois, and they will support recruitment for
specific projects through their extensive and diverse community network. Through the CPC, the Center will
engage community partners in three ways: as Center members who are actively engaged in planning and
implementing research and dissemination, as a bridge to the community to recruit research participants and
disseminate information, and as community-based providers engaged in larger systems of care. Equitable
community engagement in research increases community trust, knowledge, and understanding of research,
drives community participation in research and implementation of best practices, and builds a sense of
collaboration between researchers and the community. However, the dissemination of research to a general
audience can be challenging. The CPC will address this challenge through an equitable human-centered
design (HCD) framework that recognizes the unique expertise of all partners, including community members
and community organizations, healthcare providers, policymakers, local government agencies, and
researchers, to create an environment where all partners contribute to the research from conceptualization to
dissemination of findings. This framework shifts the community from research “subjects” to collaborative
partners. HCD is particularly effective in engaging people who play key roles in the healthcare system, but
who are often excluded in the design of healthcare interventions and system reform. To accomplish this goal,
we propose the following aims: Aim 1: Facilitate, coordinate, and evaluate community engagement and
dissemination at all phases of the research and across the Center; Aim 2: Create an integrated community
partnership framework to promote meaningful engagement and responsive research, and facilitate appropriate
and relevant dissemination that is actionable in the community and responsive to the local context; and Aim 3:
Build capacity for bilateral exchange between community partners and researchers through partnerships that
establish shared understanding and goals for research processes and community experiences."
10748098,"Training Core Abstract
Rising rates of maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity among those who face persistent disparities,
not only demand new approaches to transdisciplinary research, but these inequities mandate the training of a
new research, clinical, and public health workforce who can address these challenges. This workforce must
have a knowledge base that is steeped in the structural, environmental, behavioral, and biological factors that
affect women’s maternal health, including pregnancy-related/associated mortality and severe maternal
morbidity. In addition, the maternal health workforce must include those who represent communities typically
underrepresented in the research, clinical care delivery, and public health. Commitment to the rigorous training
and exposure of this workforce to a wide variety of diverse and transdisciplinary concepts, methods, and
approaches to etiologic and intervention research is paramount. As such, the University of Illinois at Chicago
(UIC) Maternal Health Research Center of Excellence proposes the development of a Training Program to
build the research capacity of early stage investigators (ESIs), junior faculty, post-doctoral fellows, research
assistants (RAs), as well as clinical partners from community agencies who together will have a diverse set of
skills and experiences to enable them to bring fresh insights, ask novel questions, and discover innovative
approaches to reducing inequities in maternal health outcomes.
A. Specific Aims
1. To increase the diversity of the maternal health research pipeline by recruiting and supporting the
 academic career development of racially and ethnically diverse postdoctoral and junior faculty fellows from
 a variety of clinical and public health backgrounds.
2. To develop and successfully implement a robust training program for early stage investigators, including
 junior clinical and public health faculty and post-doctoral fellows, to enable them to address a variety of
 research questions related to reducing maternal health inequities using innovative quantitative and
 qualitative research methods and strategies.
3. To provide community-based clinical partners with a robust research training experience that will enable
 them to successfully undertake or partner with investigators to conduct maternal health research.
4. To provide a strong research and journey mentoring program to early stage investigators to enable them to
 effectively address maternal health issues including reducing inequities in maternal health outcomes."
10747854,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressive, paralytic and ultimately fatal disease characterized
by the selective loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain. The overarching objective of this application
to the Optimization Track of the CREATE Bio Program is to refine the safety and efficacy of a gene therapy
that we developed for forms of ALS caused by toxic, gain-of-function mutations in superoxide dismutase 1
(SOD1), which account for up to 20% of all familial cases of the disease. Specifically, we have developed an
approach to inactivate the production of the mutant SOD1 protein in vivo using CRISPR base editing, a gene-
editing modality capable of introducing precise base substitutions in DNA, but without the requirement for a
mutagenic DNA break, thereby overcoming a major safety hurdle facing the implementation of traditional gene-
editing nucleases. In particular, when delivered to the spinal cord via adeno-associated virus, our SOD1-
targeting base-editing platform prolonged survival and markedly slowed the progression of disease in a highly
aggressive mouse model of SOD1-linked ALS.
Importantly, as opposed to current strategies for silencing SOD1, which target SOD1 mRNA and can have a
transient effect that requires a lifetime of redosing or can risk saturating endogenous RNA processing
pathways, which could then lead to adverse effects, our approach harnesses a highly precise DNA editing
pathway to permanently turn-off the production of mutant SOD1 and involves only a single treatment. Thus,
because of its strengths and in vivo efficacy, we now aim to refine this strategy for the ultimate goal of
developing a gene therapy for ALS. Specifically, by optimizing its targeting specificity, its editing capabilities, its
pharmacokinetics and its safety, which we will ensure via the introduction of a self-inactivating functionality that
facilitates its clearance from cells, we will develop a highly optimized SOD1-targeting CRISPR base editing
platform that can be used to permanently and effectively treat SOD1-linked ALS. Thus, by capitalizing on: (1) a
highly innovative DNA editing technology that has the capabilities to overcome the limitations of gene-silencing
and (2) a multidisciplinary research team with complementary expertise in ALS, AAV delivery, gene-editing and
immunology, this project will result in not only an optimized therapeutic candidate for ALS, a devastating,
debilitating and currently incurable disorder with few effective treatment options, but also lay the foundation for
using base editing to safely treat neurological disorders."
10744785,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 This application requests a career development award for a head and neck surgeon with an interest in
recurrent laryngeal nerve neuropraxia and developing prolonged methods of topical therapeutic delivery. The
described career development plan will help her to build the skills in data analysis, study design, and drug
delivery necessary to become an independent translational researcher developing topical therapeutics for
Otolaryngology applications. The candidate’s mentorship team combines expertise from neuroscience,
bioengineering, laryngology, and otolaryngology to provide a collaborative environment to help her accomplish
her goals. Dr. Kita’s objectives during this mentored career development award will be: 1) Complete coursework
in biostatistical methods, 2) Develop expertise in sustained-release therapeutics, and 3) Design a method of
further characterizing recovery from neuropraxia in a Long Evans rat model.
 Manipulation of the recurrent laryngeal nerve is common in surgical procedures of the neck.
Postoperative weakness can results in difficulty with speech, swallowing, and breathing. Return of function from
neuropraxia, the mildest and most common form of nerve injury, often takes a few months. The impairment in
communication, swallowing ability, and breathing that results can severely impact patient quality of life during
this time. This award will allow the candidate to study recovery from neuropraxia and screen topical interventions
for their ability to expedite recovery. Through the completion of this award, Dr. Kita will establish preliminary data
and a model of neuropraxia that may be used to test therapeutics. This will be accomplished in 3 aims:
1. Design a drug-eluting hydrogel with sustained elution. Melatonin will be encapsulated in poly (lactic-co-
glycolic acid) microparticles within fibrin hydrogels and elution of medication characterized.
2. Determine Schwann cell response to melatonin in vitro. Schwann cells will be grown with resuspended
melatonin, filter-sterilized eluted melatonin, and with melatonin secreted from microparticles in hydrogels.
3. Create a rat model for characterizing recovery from recurrent laryngeal nerve after neuropraxia. Vocal
fold movement video, electromyography readings, ultrasonography, and immunohistochemistry will be used to
describe recovery after injury in a Long-Evans rat model. Drug-eluting hydrogels will be implanted and analyzed
for their ability to shorten the period to recovery of vocal fold motion seen on ultrasonography.
 Recurrent laryngeal nerve neuropraxia is a common and debilitating complication after surgeries in the
neck. Better characterization of this injury will allow insight into ways to help at risk individuals. Through this
award the candidate will investigate a method of prolonged topical therapeutic delivery for its ability to assist in
recovery of vocal fold function after surgical manipulation and establish the skills necessary to become an
independent translational researcher."

 Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and their derivatives (PFAS) are industrial chemicals that are wide-
spread in the environment, including blood serum of wildlife and humans. Their pervasiveness and long half-life
raises the questions about their toxicity, especially with regards to the effect on the developing fetus. Several
studies have demonstrated that these compounds cross the placenta, are found in the umbilical cord blood, and
can cause neurodevelopmental abnormalities in the offspring of the exposed mothers, including early pregnancy
loss, low birth weight, hyperactivity, decreased head circumference and behavior problems. However, the
molecular mechanisms following PFAS exposure, such as dysregulated genes and pathways, especially in the
context of human brain development, remain unexplored. Here, we are proposing to use human induced
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived models such as neural progenitor cells (NPCs), spheroids and brain cortical
organoids, to fill in this knowledge gap. We hypothesize that PFAS impact early brain development by
dysregulating transcriptional programs of NPCs that are involved in proliferation, cell cycle and survival.
We also hypothesize that these early alterations will have significant impact on the formation of cortical
networks. We are proposing the following Specific Aims to test these hypotheses: (1) Investigate dose-
dependent impact of PFAS on neural progenitor cell cycle, cell viability and proliferation; (2) Perform genome-
wide pooled genetic screens with CRISPRi/a sgRNA libraries to identify modifier genes and pathways upon
PFAS treatment; (3) Validate the impact of PFAS on long-term neurodevelopment in cortical organoids models
and identify cell populations impacted by PFAS. Our study will identify genes, molecular and cellular pathways
dysregulated by PFAS exposure across various stages of brain development, modeled in vitro. It has a potential
to uncover new mechanisms behind PFAS exposure, and to predict the impact of PFAS on developing human
brain network function."

 2 on improving the health of vulnerable older adults, such as those with Alzheimer’s disease and
 3 related dementias (ADRD) living in rural areas, by improving systems of care. The experiences
 4 of those in rural areas with ADRD, including the older adults with ADRD, their caregivers, their
 5 health and social service providers, and their community, are distinctly different from those in
 6 urban areas. A lack of integration between services is a barrier to caregivers receiving information.
 7 Providers desire more integrated services, such as having case managers at primary care offices
 8 to help coordinate social services. Failure to improve the communication and care coordination
 9 across rural ADRD networks as the aging population increases will compound these existing
10 disparities and result in poorer care for older adults with ADRD in rural settings. Health Information
11 Technology (HIT) tools, such as telehealth, clinical decision support, mobile applications,
12 electronic referrals or prescribing, and others, have been applied in rural areas to ADRD disease
13 risk, testing, and diagnosis, but have not yet been applied to communication and care
14 coordination. The purpose of this K01 is to build off preliminary data and use network analysis to
15 identifying communication and care coordination gaps in two rural ADRD care systems then, in
16 collaboration with local older adults with ADRD, their caregivers, their health and social service
17 providers, select and pilot test a HIT tool to fill those gaps. Specifically, this study will: 1) build
18 network models of communication and care coordination within two rural ADRD networks, and
19 identify factors related to communication and care coordination gaps; 2) assess the perceived
20 usability, feasibility, and acceptability of HIT tools designed to address communication and care
21 coordination in the networks and select a HIT tool to pilot test; and 3) pilot test the communication
22 and care coordination HIT tool in the network. Through this K01 award, Dr. Prusaczyk, who is a
23 health services researcher at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (WUSM), will
24 improve upon and address gaps in her skill set through targeted training activities in: 1) advanced
25 network analysis; 2) HIT; and 3) rural ADRD research. These activities will be possible through
26 resources available at WUSM, including the Knight Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center and
27 the Institute for Informatics. Dr. Prusaczyk has the support of an outstanding mentorship team
28 with expertise in ADRD, network analysis, rural health services research, and HIT. This research
29 is significant because it will yield a comprehensive understanding of rural ADRD systems – a
30 critical context for which there is limited knowledge – and a possible solution for improvement."

Children whose parents have substance use disorders (SUDs) or histories of incarceration are especially
vulnerable to developing problematic substance use and disorders. These youth are also more likely to struggle
with comorbid mental health disorders and engage in antisocial behaviors. Although mental health and
substance use services can improve outcomes, youth face many barriers to receiving them. This is the first
prospective, longitudinal study of intergenerational patterns of service use in high-risk families. I will
investigate how parents’ experiences–their history of SUDs, service use, and barriers to services–affect their
decision to seek services for their children. Data are from two studies: the Northwestern Juvenile Project, a
prospective, longitudinal study of mental health needs and outcomes of 1829 youth in the justice system; and
Next Generation, which interviews the original participants of the Northwestern Juvenile Project, and their
children, ages 10-18 years (anticipated sample, n=640 parent and child interviews). All data collection will be
completed by April 2023. Aim 1: What determines whether children who need services receive
them? I will examine how demographic variables (e.g., age, sex, race, ethnicity) and clinical variables (type of
drug used and comorbid mental health disorders) affect children’s service use. I anticipate that Black or Latinx
youth will be less likely to receive needed services than non-Hispanic White youth; that the type of substance
used will determine if youth receive services; and that youth with comorbid disorders (e.g., posttraumatic
stress disorder) will be more likely to receive services. Aim 2: How do parents’ experiences with SUDs
and service use—during adolescence and adulthood—affect their decision to seek services for
their children? I will focus on parents’ history of SUDs, service use, attitudes, and barriers to service use
during their own adolescence and adulthood. I anticipate that the timing of the parents’ SUDs (only during
their own adolescence vs during their child’s lifetime) and the location of the parent’s services (community vs
corrections) will affect the children’s service use. I hypothesize that parents who experienced barriers to
receiving services during adolescence are less likely to seek services for their children than those who did not.
My findings will provide the empirical basis for future studies to identify novel strategies to reduce barriers to
services and to engage high-risk youth in services. My training will be strengthened by the mentorship of Dr.
Linda Teplin, the Principal Investigator of the Northwestern Juvenile Project and Next Generation, her
collaborators, Drs. Karen Abram and Leah Welty, and key personnel, Drs. Margareta Alegria and Faye Taxman,
experts in health inequities in service utilization. The proposed fellowship training plan will prepare me to
become an independent researcher of addiction science, focusing on health inequities in service use."
10845274,"A significant portion of the global burden of AUD (Alcohol use disorder) derives from an increased risk and
susceptibility to diseases including infection, cirrhosis, and cancer. These diseases are influenced by the
composition of the intestinal microbiota, which is altered by alcohol use. Though it has been accepted that
change to the microbiota contributes to disease establishment and progression in AUD, our understanding of
the mechanisms by which this occurs is inadequate. These mechanisms likely involve a variety of microbiota-
derived products (membrane vesicles, excreted chemicals, cellular components, LPS, etc.). The preliminary data
addressed herein support the proposition that microbiota-derived membrane vesicles (MVs) are an important
driver of alcohol-driven tissue injury.
To address this possibility, this proposal will examine the effects of alcohol on the composition and frequency of
microbiota derived MVs. This proposal will also evaluate the effects of alcohol-associated MVs on promoting
tissue injury and mucosal infection. Our preliminary data demonstrate that alcohol alters the composition of MVs
generated by the gut microbiota, and that isolated alcohol-associated MVs increase susceptibility to respiratory
infection, independent of alcohol use, suggesting that MVs influence mucosal host defense. We hypothesize that
MVs from an alcohol-associated microbiota will have increased inflammatory properties and increase
susceptibility to mucosal infections via epithelial inflammation and barrier dysfunction. Understanding the
alterations to bacterial MVs following alcohol exposure may give new insight into disease pathogenesis, which
may inspire future therapies centered on modulating MVs."

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major disease affecting 1 in 6 adults above 60 years of age in US that significantly impairs
quality-of-life by impacting movement and function. Tissue health and disease is frequently governed by a
complex and non-linear interplay of cell-intrinsic and systemic factors including both biochemical and biophysical
cues. The overall aim of this project is to understand how the changes in ECM (extra cellular matrix)
viscoelasticity affect cartilage homeostasis in health and during disease initiation and pathogenesis in OA.
Recent studies by our team have elegantly demonstrated that ECM viscoelasticity governs cell volume in
cartilage cells i.e. chondrocytes. Previous studies of cartilage biology had only examined the impact of ECM
elasticity (i.e. “stiffness”), and the role of viscoelasticity had been mostly ignored. We found that viscoelastic
hydrogels that exhibit fast stress relaxation, or were more viscous, could provide a microenvironment that is
more conducive to anabolic gene expression in human chondrocytes resulting in increased ECM production,
promoting a healthy chondrocyte phenotype. The underlying cause was observed to be the ability of
chondrocytes to expand their volume in the fast relaxing gels, an ability that was restricted in the slow relaxing
gels, which are more elastic. Understanding the optimal ECM viscoelasticity for healthy and human induced
pluripotent stem cell derived chondrocytes can guide ideal scaffold preparation for cartilage tissue engineering.
The aim of this proposal is therefore to optimize hydrogel viscoelasticity for engineering inflammation-
suppressive cartilage constructs. We will firstly optimize development of cartilage constructs in fast relaxing
hydrogels in the presence of dynamic mechanical loading. Secondly, these constructs will be tested in human
and rat models of cartilage defects. Thirdly, we aim to gain an understanding of the molecular pathways
underlying the relationship between mechano-transduction and inflammation in cartilage health and disease.
The experimental outcomes from these studies have the potential to enhance therapeutic strategies for cartilage
regeneration and OA that remain unmet clinical needs."

Detection of moving objects is a retinal function which is crucial for an animal's survival. Multiple neurons and
neural networks in the retina have been identified as critical players in this task, including starburst amacrine
cells (SACs) and direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs), which sense direction of motion. Recent studies
have revealed that several neural networks among bipolar and amacrine cells are involved in direction
selectivity. However, the impact of environmental factors on motion sensitivity tuning of these neurons is not
well understood. Background scenery affects the gain control and tuning of neurons for object motion
detection; however, we have just begun to understand the sensitization and adaptation of those neurons. The
long-term objective of the present project is to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms in the retina
for sensing direction of motion. We will conduct patch clamp recordings, two-photon calcium imaging,
immunohistochemistry, computational simulation, and behavioral studies to examine the mechanisms
underlying direction selectivity. We previously found that cholinergic feedback from SACs to bipolar cells
contributes to SAC direction selectivity. We now have evidence that the cholinergic feedback is transferred for
a long distance and tune SAC direction selectivity. Therefore, we hypothesize that an incoming object send a
signal to bipolar cells through a cholinergic pathway to tune SAC direction selectivity, a form of predictive
coding. We propose two Specific Aims to investigate long-distance cholinergic feedback. We will test this
hypothesis by recording long-distance cholinergic feedback in bipolar cells (Aim 1), and we will examine the
outcome of the long-distance cholinergic feedback in bipolar cell axon terminals, SAC dendrites, and DSGC
activity (Aim 2). Visual prediction is an essential feature for motion detection, which would reduce neural signal
delays and facilitate the animal reaction. Knowledge gained from the results of this project will shed light on the
additional layer of motion detection and visual signal processing in the retina."
10891426,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Deficits in motivated behavior and effort-cost decision-making (ECDM) are core to schizophrenia and related
disorders (SZ). ECDM paradigms show that SZ are less likely to use contextual information (e.g., reward
magnitude and probability) to drive decisions about whether to exert high effort for rewards. As such, they are
less likely to expend effort in situations when it would benefit them the most to do so. These motivational deficits
have been closely linked to functional outcomes and their treatment remains ineffective, highlighting the need to
examine factors that could enhance ECDM in SZ. Social influence (e.g., the presence of information about peer
decisions) has been shown to drive ECDM in healthy individuals (HC), particularly in conditions of low reward or
probability (when the other contextual factors may be less likely to independently do so). While there is very little
literature examining the role of social influence on effort in SZ, there is some evidence that SZ may increase
effort expenditure in response to social encouragement and that (unlike in HC) this may particularly be the case
in conditions of high reward magnitude. Thus, social factors could enhance ECDM in SZ by increasing effort in
the conditions in which it would be most beneficial to do so-- conditions in which SZ demonstrate the most
impairments. Consistent with behavioral findings that SZ are less likely to use reward-related information to
inform effortful decisions, they also may show reduced reward-related modulation in neural regions associated
with effective ECDM: ventral striatum, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex. Interestingly,
these regions overlap with those involved in response to peer information and social reward, raising the
possibility that social information may modulate decisions about effort in SZ by activating neural systems that
play a role in effective ECDM. Further, to understand whether and for whom these laboratory-based neural and
behavioral markers of social influence on ECDM might lead to functional benefit in SZ, it is critical to examine
how they relate to individual differences in real-world reports of social motivation. Thus, this proposal seeks to
use a multimethod framework (e.g., behavioral task, fMRI, EMA) to examine whether social information
modulates decisions about effort expenditure in SZ as it does in HC, the neural bases of these decisions, and
real-world individual differences in social motivation that are associated with this relationship. Results from the
proposed study could elucidate the nature of social and motivational impairments in SZ and inform intervention
efforts to ameliorate these impairing deficits. The realization of this project will allow the applicant to receive
training in: 1) neuroimaging techniques and analysis, 2) the link between social processes and motivated
behavior in SZ, 3) EMA design, collection and analysis, 4) research rigor and reproducibility, and 5) professional
development. This project will help the candidate accomplish her goal of becoming an independent principal
investigator that uses multimodal approaches to investigate the mechanisms and real-world correlates of social
and motivational impairments in SZ."

 Sensory adaptation is a short-term memory process by which a signaling system returns to its
pre-stimulus level despite ongoing exposure to the input signal. Although well-characterized in
bacterial chemotaxis, little is known about how adaptation operates in the other bacterial signaling
systems. A better understanding of how adaptation operates in these systems will provide new
fundamental knowledge and could identify new therapeutic approaches. We focus on
mechanosensing, which is critical for surface colonization and infection in Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (PA), a leading cause of multi-drug resistant nosocomial infections and a significant
health threat. PA uses the Pil-Chp mechanosensing system to transduce a mechanical signal that
drives twitching motility and cAMP production to modulate a virulence program upon surface
contact. How adaptation functions in this system, or mechanosensing in general, is unexplored.
We propose to dissect the mechanism and role of adaptation in the Pil-Chp system because (i)
The core enzymatic machinery of the mechanosensory adaptation system, the methylating
enzyme PilK and demethylating enzyme ChpB, are conserved but its regulation appears to be
distinct from the E. coli chemotaxis system; (ii) This system affords the opportunity to understand
how adaptation is deployed in response to surface contact; and (iii) The Pil-Chp system
contributes to virulence in a murine model of acute pneumonia, demonstrating its relevance to
human PA infections. We discovered that PilK acts as a methylase and ChpB acts as a
demethylase for the PilJ chemoreceptor to control the two outputs. Unlike in chemotaxis, the
methylase and demethylase exhibit inverse spatial localization. Our studies support a model in
which the PilK methylase localizes to the lagging pole, where the PilJ chemoreceptor would be
methylated and poised to be activated. In contrast, the ChpB demethylase is recruited to the
leading pole by interactions with the response regulator PilG. PilG is required for coordinating
TFP extension and retraction at the leading pole. This localization would lead to temporally and
spatially restricted PilJ demethylation at the leading pole. PilJ activity would be dampened,
potentially facilitating PilG relocalization to the lagging pole and reversals. Thus, sensory
adaptation in the Pil-Chp system is fundamentally different from adaptation in E. coli chemotaxis
in that it uses temporal AND spatial cues. We will test this hypothesis as follows: Aim 1. Link
PilJ methylation states to PilJ activity and outputs. Aim 2. Determine how the response
regulator PilG regulates the ChpB demethylase. Aim 3. Test whether the PilK methylase is
regulated by MapZ, a c-di-GMP binding protein, to link twitching and flagellar motility."

Cortico-cortical projection neurons (CCPNs) connect cortical areas with each other to facilitate
sensory processing and execute appropriate motor actions. Defects in intra-cortical connectivity
are associated with a variety of neural circuit disorders such as dyslexia, autism, and
schizophrenia. Because these diseases have genetic components and potentially arise from
altered brain development, it is important to understand how CCPNs know which area to target
and which synaptic inputs to receive. The long-term goal of my research program is to gain
mechanistic insights into cortical circuit assembly at the single cell level in an effort to
understand underpinnings of neurodevelopmental disorders and develop new therapies. In
doing so, we will be able to identify molecular and genetic mechanisms that link gene
expression and neural activity to neuronal connectivity. The objective of this proposal is to
identify mechanisms by which long-range cortico-cortical neuronal connectivity is established in
the mammalian cortex using the mouse visual system as a model. Our central hypothesis is that
V1 neurons, projecting to the AL (anterolateral: V1→AL) or the PM (posteromedial: V1→PM)
higher visual areas, differ in timing and molecular regulation of their axonal projection
development, and their input versus output connectivity is specified by two distinct rules: early
specification and synaptic pruning mechanism, respectively. We will test this hypothesis with the
following aims: 1) we will determine the patterns and timing of cortico-cortical neuronal
projection development in the mouse visual cortex. 2) we will determine the roles of Teneurins,
cell-adhesion molecules, in specifying the projection identities of V1→AL and V1→PM neurons.
3) we will determine developmental principles of ‘like-to-like’ cortico-cortical feedback circuit
formation. This research is significant because elucidating the developmental mechanisms of
neural circuit assembly will provide cell-type or circuit-specific therapeutic interventions for
specific aspects of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorder phenotypes. The proposed
research is innovative because we are using and developing the technical solutions to allow us
to target gene expression and capture the rapid developmental connectivity dynamics of layer-
and projection-specific cortical neurons. Results will provide a comprehensive understanding of
how a long-range connectivity network arises at the cellular level. This new knowledge will have
a positive impact on the neuroscience field as it will establish a solid foundation to provide
connectivity-based therapeutic interventions for neurodevelopmental disorders."
10841615,"Project Summary (Abstract)
 Lymphatic vessels play an important role in tissue fluid homeostasis and immune surveillance. Thus,
impaired function of lymphatic vessels due to abnormal vessel development or damaged lymphatic vessels
causes obstruction of draining body fluid and leads to the development of lymphedema. Despite a continuous
increase in the incidence of lymphedema, therapeutic options are limited to conservative treatment or palliative
surgery. Over the past decades, new biological treatments such as gene or cell therapy have emerged for
treating various cardiovascular diseases. However, the effects of adult stem cells turned out to be minimal, and
embryonic or induced pluripotent stem cell (ESC/iPSC)-derived cells are costly to produce and maintain and
may cause side effects. To avoid these problems, a new approach, called direct reprogramming or direct
conversion has been developed, in which somatic cells are converted into other lineage cells by overexpression
of lineage- or cell-type specific transcription factors (TFs). This approach allows simpler and safer target cell
generation and has the potential for more convenient clinical translation. With this direct reprogramming
approach, we have successfully generated reprogrammed endothelial cells (rECs) via ETV2, and more recently,
reprogrammed lymphatic ECs (rLECs).
 The overall goal of this project is to develop a direct reprogramming approach for treating lymphedema.
The direct EC reprogramming approach for therapy has two options: cell therapy or direct in vivo reprogramming.
In this proposal, we will follow both options. For clinical application, both require a safer delivery vector to
minimize the possibility of genomic integration. Thus, we developed an adenoviral-ETV2 (Ad-ETV2) vector. As
a first approach, we will develop a cell-based therapy using rLECs. As a second approach, we will develop a
direct in vivo reprogramming approach without using cells. In the latter, Ad-ETV2 will be injected into animal
models to see whether host cells can be reprogrammed into LECs and form new lymphatic vessels. To date,
none of these two approaches have been attempted for treating lymphedema. More specifically, in Aim 1, we
will generate early and late rLECs from human fibroblasts by changing various culture conditions. In Aim 2, we
will determine the therapeutic effects of rLECs on experimental lymphedema and the mechanisms underlying
these therapeutic effects. In Aim 3, we will explore whether ETV2 is able to directly reprogram fibroblasts into
functional LECs, induce lymphatic vessel formation, and ameliorate lymphedema. We anticipate that the results
of the proposed experiments will yield new insight into the role of novel cell and gene therapy for treating
lymphedema."
10885204,"Children and adults with neurological conditions often experience significant, lifelong consequences of their illness. Rigorous clinical trials have yielded substantial advances in care for people with neurological disorders. For several conditions, however, the development of meaningful therapeutic interventions has not materialized. The Network for Excellence in Neuroscience Clinical Trials (NeuroNEXT) was created with a goal of reducing barriers to successful early-phase clinical trials for neurological diseases. The network has made progress, not only by conducting trials with on-time or early enrollment completion, but also by succeeding in expediting trial start-up through use of a central Institutional Review Board and master trial agreements. Equally important is the mission embedded in NeuroNEXT to ensure the next generation of neurology clinical trialists receives adequate training and mentorship to expand the capacity to design and conduct these trials. An advisory workgroup evaluated NeuroNEXT in 2022 and set forth additional recommendations, including prioritizing trials in pediatric populations, integrating the patient voice in the development of trials and strengthening community engagement, improving the racial and ethnic representativeness of trial participants and research team members, and further enabling the development of the clinical trial investigator workforce. Our Kennedy Krieger Institute and Johns Hopkins University (KKI-JHU) team is eager to become a flagship NeuroNEXT site by addressing several aims: 1) bolstering the integration of KKI-JHU NeuroNEXT site infrastructure to support wide-ranging neurology-focused trials across the lifespan, including gene-targeted therapies and rare disease interventions; 2) ensuring the efficiency and quality of trial conduct by using Clinical and Translational Science Award resources and closely working with the NeuroNEXT Clinical and Data Coordinating Centers; 3) implementing a rigorous training program for NeuroNEXT fellows; and 4) embedding an engaged approach to the concepts of diversity and inclusion in all site activities, beginning with a representative leadership team. We will broadly share what we learn with the network. We offer an extraordinarily talented and diverse multidisciplinary group of clinicians and other investigative team members, a track record of excellence in mentorship, a large and representative patient population, and extensive institutional and regional resources for conducting clinical trials. As a committed and collegial group of leaders, we are confident that the KKI-JHU site will add unique and tremendous value to NeuroNEXT, ensuring the rapid success of NeuroNEXT trials and expansion of a talented pool of neurology trialists."
10896210,"Lineage plasticity has emerged as an important mechanism of treatment resistance in prostate cancer that
results into multiple different tumor states. Recent classifications efforts have revealed that besides the androgen
receptor pathway positive adenocarcinomas (CRPC-AD) and the terminal neuroendocrine tumors (NEPC), there
are also tumors enriched in a “hybrid state” characterized by the expression of mesenchymal and stem cell traits.
This phenotype is termed mesenchymal and stem-like prostate cancer (MSPC). The overarching goal of this
application is to identify novel molecular mechanisms underlying the MSPC phenotype that can be targeted
therapeutically. Our hypothesis is that the loss of PKCλ/ ι
(encoded by PRKCI gene), by upregulating the
CD44/Hyaluronan (HA) axis, induces the mesenchymal phenotype characterized by the activation of epithelial
EMT and the generation of desmoplastic tumor stroma, both critical events for tumor progression and therapy
resistance. We postulate that the detailed characterization of the mechanisms whereby PKCλ/ ι controls the
CD44/HA axis will provide critical new information on the molecular pathways leading to MSPC progression and
will offer a rationale for the selection of patients susceptible to respond to new therapies designed at
mesenchymal/stromal targets. Our preliminary data demonstrate that (1) human MSPC has low PRKCI levels
and a highly desmoplastic stroma; (2) PKCλ/ ι loss in the prostate epithelium in vivo induces EMT and promotes
a desmoplastic response that remodels the tumor microenvironment; (3) Low PRKCI levels correlate with
upregulation of the CD44/HA axis in human PCa, supporting the human relevance of these findings. Based on
these premises, in this proposal we will address the following specific Aims: Aim 1A: Determine how interfering
with CD44 or its ligands (OPN/SPP1, HA) block MSPC and enzalutamide resistance promoted by PKCλ/ ι-
deficiency in the epithelium; Aim 1B: Determine the role of the CD44/HA axis in stromal activation and the
stromal-epithelial feedback crosstalk; Aim 1C: Determine the molecular mechanism whereby PKCλ/ ι regulates
CD44; Aim 2A: Determine the role of prostate epithelial CD44 in driving MSPC in vivo; Aim 2B: Determine the
role of prostate stromal CD44 in driving MSPC in vivo; Aim 3A: Determine the therapeutic potential of PEGPH20
in combination with enzalutamide in the treatment of MSPC tumors and Aim 3B: Investigate its mechanism of
action at a single-cell level. The results of this proposal will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding
of the mechanisms driving the MSPC type of PCa and will be key for the design of new more selective and
effective therapies for this type of aggressive neoplasia."

Throughout history, infectious diseases have been, and continue to be, a leading cause of morbidity and
mortality throughout the world. While all ages are affected by infectious diseases, the ends of the spectrum of
life (young children and elderly) are particularly vulnerable. Thus, the prevention and treatment of infectious
diseases through the development of vaccines, therapeutics, devices and diagnostics is a critical global
priority.
As a VTEU for nearly 25 years, we have provided the scientific, clinical, administrative, and organizational
structure to support implementation of clinical trials and studies for the Division of Microbiology and Infectious
Diseases (DMID) including respiratory infections, enteric diseases, sexually transmitted infections and
neglected tropical diseases. Also, we are recognized experts in the area of human challenge infection models
(CHIMs) of enteric and respiratory pathogens. Additionally we repeatedly have demonstrated the ability to
provide surge capacity to address infectious disease outbreaks as evidenced by our responses to the testing of
H5N1 and novel H1N1 influenza vaccines (for which we received a personal letter from Dr Anthony Fauci). To
further expand the capabilities of our Unit; we have added expertise in epidemiology and vaccine
effectiveness.
We consistently have met or exceed enrollment goals and routinely have over 90% of our subjects
complete the study. We consistently have exceeded contractual obligations, including rapid recruitment of
subjects spanning the age spectrum including pregnant women.
We have provided outstanding leadership of multi-center studies and have been excellent collaborators on
studies led by other VTEU sites. We have developed investigator initiated trials and have assisted in the
development of trials initiated by DMID. We also have undertaken vaccine projects incorporating systems
biology to more deeply understand correlates of vaccine-induced immunity. We are extremely excited to
continue as a VTEU, collaborating with the IDCRC, the Leadership Group, NIAID, and other Infectious
Diseases experts under this NIAID Cooperative Agreement."

People experience more positive than negative consequences from drinking,1 but negative consequences
often have the potential to have a larger impact on a person (e.g., romantic or friendship problems, poor
academic performance, and unsafe driving).2,3 According to alcohol expectancy theory4 and social learning
theory,5 the experience of consequences after drinking leads to the development or updating of expectancies
(e.g., beliefs about what consequence will occur as a result of drinking).4 However, understanding an
individual’s expectancy evaluations such as likelihoods and valences likely depend, at least in part, on how
individuals perceive recently experienced consequences. Previous research has not consistently evaluated
people’s evaluations of consequences,6–9 and if they do they only evaluate the consequence once either cross-
sectionally or retrospectively the next day. This prevents us from gaining an understanding of how people view
these consequences and how their views change with time. In addition to the changing consequence
evaluations, research has typically aggregated across positive and negative expectancies6,8,10–13 which has
prevented us from developing an understanding of how expectancy evaluations are altered following the
experience of specific consequences and how these may change leading up to a drinking event. To address
these gaps, the proposed F31 will use a complex ecological momentary assessment (EMA) design to assess
consequence and expectancy evaluations over the short term to examine changes in people’s perceptions
based on their experiences. Specific Aims include (1) test whether Fading Affect Bias (FAB) can be observed
as changes in people’s evaluations of positive and negative drinking consequences following weekend drinking
episodes over the course of a week and (2) test whether likelihoods change over the short term, to what extent
these changes depend on prior experience of these consequences, whether FAB can be observed as changes
in people’s valences of negative expectancies, and whether increases can be observed as changes in people’s
valences of positive expectancies leading up to a drinking episode, and (3) test how the changes in
consequence evaluations are associated with changes in likelihoods and valences over the short term. To
complement these aims, the applicant will receive training in (1) alcohol expectancy theory and young adult
alcohol consequences and expectancies, (2) design and implementation of longitudinal ecological momentary
assessment (EMA) studies, (3) quantitative analysis, and (4) research dissemination via manuscript
preparation and conference presentations. Study findings will have important implications for future alcohol
expectancies prevention research. Specifically, results can be used to inform individuals on a daily-level of
when they may be susceptible to experiencing a greater number of negative consequences from drinking on a
given occasion and prompt greater reflection of upcoming plans."

 Understanding individual differences in language understanding and use in autism is a top priority of
research, as the acquisition of language early in life has been consistently linked with long-term outcomes in
individuals with autism. Typically developing children look to visual cues of speech (i.e., mouth movements),
early in life during language acquisition, and visual cues facilitate speech processing across the lifespan.
Looking to visual speech cues has been associated with language ability, but the neural mechanism underlying
this link is not well understood. Multisensory speech processing may explain individual differences in language
understanding and use. Electroencephalography (EEG) research has illustrated a boost in speech processing
efficiency in response to audiovisual speech via a decrease, or suppression, in the amplitude of the event-
related potential (ERP) signal in response to audiovisual speech versus auditory-only speech. Children with
autism show highly variable amplitude suppression, and the degree of amplitude suppression is associated
with language ability. However, it is unclear at present how early in development this phenomenon emerges
and whether it explains observed links between looking to audiovisual speech and language understanding
and use. This dissertation project seeks to evaluate the emergence of amplitude suppression and to
statistically test whether speech processing efficiency mediates the association between early looking to
audiovisual speech and language understanding and use in infants at increased likelihood for autism. A low
demand measure of speech processing with the temporal precision necessary to evaluate immediate
responses to speech (EEG) and a state-of-the-art measure of eye gaze with high precision to attentional focus
(eye-tracking) will be used. We hypothesize that relatively low, general population level likelihood infants will
display amplitude suppression at 12-18 months of age. Additionally, we hypothesize that infants at increased
familial likelihood for autism on average will display less amplitude suppression compared to their lower
likelihood peers. However, based on previous observations of variable audiovisual speech processing in
autism, we expect to see a wide range of individual differences in the amount of amplitude suppression
experienced in response to audiovisual speech. We anticipate that the degree of amplitude suppression will
explain the relation between looking to audiovisual speech and language understanding and use.
IMPACT: If our hypotheses are born out, the proposed work will yield empirical support for a novel framework
of language learning in early development and improve our understanding of the neural mechanisms
underlying differential language development in infants at elevated likelihood for autism and communication
disorders. This improved understanding of early language development has the potential to facilitate early
identification of children who may struggle with language acquisition and guide our development of
preventative interventions that may mitigate the long-term consequences of language impairments."
10751023,"Transient global ischemia in rodents (2 vessel occlusion in mice, 2VO) induces delayed death of hippocampal
CA1 neurons and is a model for human ischemic brain injury and long lasting hippocampal memory deficits.
Events that occur before neuronal death include caspase and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member (Bax)
activation, cleavage of the anti-death Bcl-2 family protein Bcl-xL, cellular Ca2+ dysregulation and large
conductance mitochondrial channel activity. The opening of a large conductance, Ca2+ dependent, inner
mitochondrial membrane channel occurs early during the injury phase, therefore the identification and targeting
of this inner membrane channel has long been an important goal of both basic research and clinical communities.
The inner membrane channel is known as the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). It is activated
by neuronal Ca2+ dysregulation and by the binding of the mitochondrial peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase
cyclophilin D (CypD). It has been reported that CypD binds to the stator region of the ATP synthase at the OSCP
subunit. CypD binding is inhibited by the well-known mPTP inhibitor cyclosporine A (CsA), which attenuates mPT
channel activation. During the previous funding period, we were the first to demonstrate that the ATP synthase
membrane-embedded c-subunit forms the largest known channel of the mPTP, the ATP synthase c-subunit leak
channel (ACLC), and we showed that CsA inhibits ACLC activity by binding within the ATP synthase F1/stator
portion because channel inhibition fails to occur when the membrane portions of the ATP synthase are chemically
stripped of the F1/stator components. We also reported that Dexpramipexole (Dex) is a safe modulator of ATP
synthase leak that binds directly to OSCP/subunit b on the stator complex. Dex ameliorates disease in a
neurodevelopmental brain disorder. In this current renewal we will focus on the ACLC as the target to inhibit
mPTP opening and death. By mutation of the c-subunit to reduce channel activity, we will inhibit ACLC opening
and prevent mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT) during glutamate excitotoxicity in neurons and in vivo
ischemic brain injury in mice. We will determine if memory loss, a severe, long lasting effect of transient global
ischemia in rodents and humans, will be prevented by this genetic strategy."
10751025,"Project Summary/Abstract
Blindness resulting from photoreceptor degeneration is a leading cause of disability. A primary treatment option
is the use of epiretinal prostheses, which directly activate retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), sending artificial visual
signals to the brain. However, vision restoration with current-day epiretinal prostheses is limited, due to the
coarse-grained stimulation that fails to replicate natural, light-evoked RGC activation patterns. In natural vision,
~20 functionally-distinct RGC types communicate unique representations of the visual world to the brain
through coordinated and precise cell type-specific patterns of activity. Modern implants don’t produce
high-acuity vision in part because they fail to elicit naturalistic RGC responses, due to coarse and nonspecific
stimulation. The goal of my research is to determine how well vision can be restored in the central retina by
analyzing the responses of primate RGCs to visual and electrical stimulation.
To accomplish this goal, I will first conduct ex vivo experiments in the central retina of the macaque monkey
with visual and electrical stimulation while recording with a high-density multi-electrode array. After identifying
the major functionally-distinct cell types, we will then characterize their spatiotemporal light response properties
and determine how they differ from cells of the same types in the peripheral retina. I will also compare how well
features from natural images are represented by central and peripheral RGCs of the major types. Next, to
determine how well central RGCs can be electrically activated, I will determine the electrical receptive fields for
each cell as well as quantify the extent to which RGCs of each type can be stimulated selectively. We will then
test the degree to which RGCs of major types in the central retina can be activated without activating axon
bundles. To achieve better electrical access to RGCs in the central retina, I will test whether removing the inner
limiting membrane decreases stimulation thresholds and enhances selective activation. In cases in which
selective activation of RGCs is unattainable with single-electrode stimulation, I will test whether tri-electrode
stimulation can better focus the electric field on a cell of interest through current steering to enhance selective
activation. Finally, to estimate how well high-resolution vision can be restored with a future implant targeting the
central retina, we will develop a simulation by aggregating the visual and electrical response properties across
many data sets and perform image reconstruction analyses to quantify the structural details of images that can
be perceived."

The neurotransmitter dopamine provides an important modulatory signal that facilitates a myriad
of brain functions. The heterogeneity of neurons in the VTA has long been appreciated, but
therapeutic strategies targeting the system are still based on a monolithic perspective. Recent
advances in genetics-based methods have provided new approaches to resolving the molecular
pathways that regulate the intrinsic properties of these cells that underlie their distinct functions
and likely confer unique pharmacological sensitivities. Using single nuclear RNA sequencing,
we defined unique genetic signatures within specific cell types that we hypothesize contributes
to their functionality. Specifically, we identified ion channel subunits that are differentially
expressed in dopamine subpopulations that confer unique electrophysiological properties to
essential voltage-gated potassium channels that we hypothesize contributes to differences in
the intrinsic excitability of these cells. We have also defined the unique circuit connectivity of
these cells. We will utilize a combination of genetic and pharmacological approaches to
understand how the regulation of ion channels and circuit connections contributes to the
specialization of these cell types. In addition to the genetic profile of specific populations, we
have identified a neuropeptide receptor that is expressed in subsets of the major projection
subpopulations. Activation of neurons that express this receptor is minimally sufficient to
promote reinforcement, but the function of this receptor and its intracellular signaling in this
context remain largely unknown. To address this, we will use a combination of pharmacology
and molecular genetics approaches to understand the intracellular signaling associated with this
receptor that confers its function within dopamine neurons. Collectively, the aims of this
proposal will provide important new insight into the molecular pharmacology of dopamine
subpopulations."

Immunotherapy has recently emerged as a promising new approach to cancer treatment. Durable anti-tumor
responses have been achieved with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) such as anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4.
However, most cancer patients respond poorly to ICIs, including soft tissue sarcoma patients. An important
research objective in improving therapy for soft tissue sarcoma patients is to understand pathways that are
associated with resistance to ICIs. Downregulation of the antigen presentation pathway has been associated
with resistance to ICIs in various cancers. Radiation therapy, on the other hand, has been shown to increase
antigen presentation. Although it has been postulated that radiotherapy enhances therapeutic effects of ICIs
through upregulation of MHC-I molecules, the regulatory pathway(s) for radiation-induced MHC-I upregulation
remains poorly understood. To investigate the role of radiotherapy in modulating tumor antigen presentation, I
will use genetically engineered mouse models of autochthonous soft tissue sarcomas to dissect the
mechanisms responsible for modulating MHC-I expression after radiation.
The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate the mechanisms by which radiotherapy can help to overcome
immunotherapy resistance. The primary objective of this proposal is to investigate the underlying pathway
through which radiotherapy modulates the MHC-I antigen presentation pathway. The central hypothesis of this
study is that radiotherapy upregulates MHC-I expression in soft tissue sarcomas, which increases neoantigen
presentation to the immune system and sensitizes tumor cells to cytotoxic T cell killings and ICI treatments. I
will test this hypothesis in the following two specific aims:
Aim 1: Investigate regulatory networks responsible for MHC-I expression in soft tissue sarcomas.
Aim 2: Test whether radiation increases neoantigen presentation on tumor cells and antigen-presenting cells in
vivo."

The pretectum (PT) is a relatively unexplored brain area in mammals, and it is currently unknown
how the PT affects the visual properties of thalamic neurons that underly the complex integration
of vision and movement. Here, a team of investigators propose a multifaceted approach - from
synapse to behavior – to answer fundamental questions regarding PT circuits (Aim 1), the visual
and/or motor response properties of identified PT neurons (Aim 2), the effects of PT input on the
response properties of thalamic neurons (Aim 3), and the effects of the PT on visual behavior
(Aim 4). Each aim will utilize a combination of novel intersectional circuit labeling techniques,
neuronal activation, and recording strategies to probe two identified PT pathways: a GABAergic
pathway to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the visual sector of the thalamic reticular
nucleus (vTRN), and a nonGABAergic pathway to the pulvinar nucleus (PUL) from PT neurons
that contain parvalbumin. Aim 1 will use cre-dependent monosynaptic rabies tracing to induce
the expression of the calcium indicator GCaMP to classify, using 2P imaging, the receptive field
properties and morphology of retinal ganglion cells that innervate PT-LGN/TRN and PT-PUL
neurons. Monosynaptic rabies tracing will also be used to characterize cortical and subcortical
brain inputs to PT-LGN/TRN and PT-PUL cells; identified PT inputs will subsequently be studied
using electron microscopy and in vitro whole cell recordings paired with optogenetic activation to
characterize their ultrastructure and synaptic properties. Aim 2 will use in vivo extracellular
recordings in awake animals paired with “opto-tagging” to determine the response properties of
PT-LGN/TRN and PT-PUL neurons. Aim 3 will use in vivo extracellular recordings from awake
animals paired with optogenetic activation of PT inputs to determine the effects of the PT inputs
on LGN, vTRN and PUL response properties. Finally, Aim 4 will use cre- and flp-dependent
chemogenetic activation of PT-LGN/TRN or PT-PUL neurons to determine if these cells affect
stereopsis and/or optokinetic responses. Collectively, these 4 lines of inquiry will provide key
information regarding the role of the PT in active vision."

Age-related heart valve disease is the 3rd leading cause of cardiovascular disease and is especially prevalent
among the elderly. Studies have shown that degenerative aortic valve disease affects over 25% of people over
65 years of age, and eventually leads to calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD). There is no effective medical
therapy that modifies the progression of CAVD. CAVD is believed to be primarily driven by the valve interstitial
cells (VICs). Briefly, when these normally quiescent VICs become ‘activated’ via unknown mechanisms, they
become myofibroblasts and express smooth muscle α–actin and cadherin-11 (CDH11). We have generated
robust evidence over the past decade to advance CDH11 as a prime candidate for CAVD therapy. Our
hypothesis is that CDH11 is the mechanobiological driver of the majority of cases of CAVD and that targeting it
can halt the progression and possibly reverse CAVD. Therefore, we propose three aims to advance targeting of
CDH11 for treatment of CAVD. Aim 1: Clarify the cell-cell-specific mechanism of CDH11 engagement that leads
to CAVD. Aim 2: Determine if targeting CDH11 can halt or reverse AS progression. Aim 3: Evaluate circulating
CDH11 as a biomarker to identify interventional timing in AS patients. At the conclusion of these aims, we will
have clarified the precise cell-cell interaction by which CDH11 drives CAVD, established if targeting CDH11 after
the development of CAVD can halt or reverse the pathology, and determined if circulating CDH11 can be used
as a biomarker in the progression of AS to guide a future clinical trial."

Adolescence is a time of both vulnerability and opportunity for brain and behavioral development. Cortical
spine pruning and outgrowth of the axons of the dopamine system are two hallmarks of adolescent brain
development that can be observed in humans, primates, and rodents (Delevich et al. 2021). Exploration, risk
taking, and dispersal from the natal site or familial group are core behavioral milestones of adolescent
development in many species, yet we currently do not understand how and why these behaviors are regulated
by changes in neurobiology (Lin & Wilbrecht, 2022). The relationship between these topics is challenging to
study because programs for adolescent development are likely disrupted by domestication in lab animals.
A wild species of mouse, Mus spicilegus, presents an exciting model in which to study adolescent
development and risk taking because it shows different life history trajectory depending on season of birth. M.
spicilegus born in spring and summer on long days (LD) disperse in the first three months of life, while M.
spicilegus born on shorter autumnal days (SD) delay dispersal through the wintertime. We are breeding these
mice in a laboratory context to compare age-matched mice who will express adolescent developmental
programs on different timelines. In preliminary data we confirmed that when we reared M. spicilegus on an
SD 10h:14h light:dark photoperiod, they showed reduced weight gain and reduced novel object investigation
compared to 12h:12h reared mice (Cryns et al., 2022).
Here we will test the idea that differences in photoperiod alter risk taking exploratory behavior in M.
spicilegus via effects on the development of the tail of the striatum (TS). We have decided to focus on
the TS area because of recent work showing that dopamine release in the TS regulates approach and retreat
behavior in the context of a novel object (Menegas et al., 2018; Akiti et al., 2022). This makes it an exciting
candidate for the control of a larger repertoire of bold adolescent exploratory behaviors that support natal
dispersal. In Aim 1, we will use newly established nIRCat imaging in ex vivo slices (Beyene et al., 2019) and
fiber photometry in vivo recording of dLight to test how rearing in short day (SD) and long day (LD)
photoperiod impacts dopamine release in the tail of the striatum. In Aim 2, we will test how rearing in short
day (SD) and long day (LD) photoperiod impacts spine pruning on the cortical neurons that project to the tail
of the striatum.
Photoperiod manipulation will create new contrasts that allow us to dissociate age from function.
These data will be impactful because they will help to isolate mechanisms that evolved to regulate
adolescent risk-taking and dispersal related behavior. These data can have broad impact on
understanding vulnerabilities and opportunities in human adolescence."
10880359,"SUMMARY
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive and lethal neuroendocrine lung cancer type. Most patients initially
respond to chemotherapy but relapse occurs within months and genetic alterations that drive chemoresistance
are poorly understood. Beyond amplification of MYC family members and epigenetic silencing of SLFN11, the
field has an extremely poor understanding of genes that promote SCLC chemoresistance. We developed a novel
system in which we genetically alter highly chemosensitive patient derived xenograft (PDX) models of SCLC to
identify perturbations that confer resistance to cisplatin/etoposide (CIS-ETO) in vivo. Lentiviral overexpression
of either MYCN or MYCL caused complete switch to chemoresistance (Grunblatt et al, 2020). To systematically
identify SCLC chemoresistance drivers, we expanded use of this PDX lentiviral transduction system to perform
in vivo CRISPR inactivation screens. We identified sgRNAs targeting multiple components of the SAGA (Spt-
Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase) chromatin modifying complex as screen hits and confirmed that deleting the SAGA
member USP22, a deubiquitylase, indeed confers chemoresistance in two SCLC PDX models, while return of
USP22 to a USP22-null SCLC PDX model re-sensitizes to chemotherapy. Our overarching hypothesis is that
suppressing the expression of USP22 and SAGA complex members drives chemoresistance in SCLC, and that
transcriptional changes caused by SAGA suppression are critical. Aim 1, we will interrogate how genetically
perturbing multiple SAGA complex members, including USP22 and TADA1, in PDX models alters the in vivo
response to chemotherapy. Aim 2 employs genomic and proteomic approaches to develop a deep molecular
understanding of the USP22-regulated genes and pathways that contribute to chemotherapy response in SCLC
and uses human patient data to prioritize key SAGA targets for functional study. Decades of studying
chemotherapy response in SCLC cell lines grown in vitro have provided little insight into how chemoresistance
emerges, suggesting that key aspects of this process are not recapitulated under tissue culture conditions. Our
novel system prioritizes the study of chemoresistance using in vivo approaches with potential to provide
foundational knowledge to help prevent chemoresistance or re-sensitize chemoresistant SCLC to chemotherapy."
10909373,"Project Summary: Intracellular vesicular transport is essential for all aspects of neutrophil physiology and
defects in this mechanism leads to disease in humans. In neutrophils, vesicular trafficking is associated with the
processes of exocytosis, phagocytosis, signaling and NETs production; however, the molecular mechanisms
that regulate mobilization of the different neutrophil secretory organelles require further elucidation. We have
identified several key regulators of neutrophil granule trafficking, including the small GTPase Rab27a and its
effectors JFC1 and Munc13-4. We have now identified WASH as a neutrophil factor that regulates cytoskeleton
remodeling, vesicular trafficking and phagosomal maturation. Furthermore, we have pioneered the development
of systems biology approaches to analyze vesicular dynamics and actin remodeling in granulocytes. Finally, we
have identified a novel mechanism of late endosomal maturation that involves the interaction between the
calcium sensor Munc13-4 and the late endosomal SNARE protein syntaxin 7 (STX7), to regulate TLR9 signaling
and downstream neutrophil functions. Here, we use innovative quantitative methods to elucidate the
mechanisms regulating vesicular transport associated with exocytosis, phagocytosis, late endosomal maturation
and NETs production in neutrophils. We also propose to use our newly designed small-molecule inhibitors of
Rab27a-JFC1 and Munc13-4-STX7 binding to investigate mechanisms of vesicular transport and to elucidate
neutrophil function in disease using in vivo models of systemic inflammation and infection. The central goal of
this grant is to elucidate the vesicular transport mechanisms that govern neutrophil pro-inflammatory processes,
develop translational approaches to interfere with these processes and provide preclinical validation for their use
to attenuate systemic inflammation. Since dysregulated neutrophil activation is injurious to the host and
neutrophil secretory proteins play fundamental roles in the damage to the endothelium associated with
endotoxemia, sepsis and sterile inflammation, these studies have important physiological significance and
potential clinical applications. We hypothesize that the differential regulation of vesicular transport by Rab27a
and its effectors is an essential mechanism to determine specific neutrophil functions and responses to insult.
We also propose that small-molecule modulators of specific vesicular transport pathways will prevent some of
the deleterious consequences of neutrophil activation during systemic inflammation. To test our hypotheses we
propose the following Specific Aims: 1) Define the mechanisms that differentially regulate vesicular trafficking,
actin-dependent propulsion and blockage of neutrophil granule subsets during phagocytosis and NETosis; 2)
Establish the molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial nucleic acid-sensing by endosomal TLR signaling in
neutrophils; 3) Develop mechanistic and translational approaches to decrease neutrophil-mediated systemic
inflammation without affecting the innate immune response. The proposed research will elucidate the molecular
mechanisms regulating neutrophil vesicular transport and lead to new strategies to treat inflammatory diseases."

An estimated 3.1 million American are currently diagnosed with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and
the worldwide incidence of disease is increasing. There is growing appreciation for mitochondrial
dysfunction as a cause of and therapeutic target for inflammatory disease, however mitochondrial health
has been understudied in the intestine. The broad goal of this proposal is to determine how
mitochondrial dysfunction in the intestinal epithelium contributes to IBD pathogenesis and to
investigate whether reversing or preventing mitochondrial dysfunction can improve outcomes.
We evaluated the intestinal epithelium of patients with IBD for protein levels and expression of
Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor-γ Coactivator 1-α (PGC1α), the master regulator protein of
mitochondrial biogenesis, and found evidence of significant downregulation. Intestinal epithelium-specific
PGC1α knockout mice were found to be highly susceptible to an acute intestinal injury model, while
pharmacologic restitution of PGC1α levels rescued mice from inflammation. Recently, we found that
mitophagy is a key adaptive response to mitochondrial damage in the intestine during IBD. In response
to mitochondrial injury, the mitophagy protein Nix is upregulated and moves to the mitochondria where it
binds LC3 and initiates degradation of the affected mitochondria. In parallel to these investigations, we
contributed to an important multi-institutional study detailing a “mitochondriopathy” of pediatric-onset UC
characterized by downregulation of PGC1α and associated genes governing oxidative phosphorylation
and mitochondrial quality control. In fact, this mitochondrial signal was found to be the most
significant hallmark of treatment-naïve pediatric-onset UC. Although a disruption of mitochondrial
dynamics alone likely does not cause IBD, it appears to drive ongoing inflammation within the intestinal
epithelium and may serve as important biomarker of disease. Whether a cause or consequence of
disease, we postulate that the process of mitochondrial dysfunction offers significant opportunity for
therapeutic intervention. Our hypothesis is that the mitochondriopathy of IBD is a signature feature
of disease with important functional consequences, and one that is amenable to therapeutic
targeting. In order to test this hypothesis, we have devised the following aims: Aim 1: To evaluate the
cause of mitochondrial dysfunction during IBD. Aim 2: To characterize the physiologic response
to mitochondrial dysfunction during IBD. Aim 3: To target mitochondrial dysfunction
therapeutically in murine colitis and characterize the metabolic effects of mitochondrial
dysfunction in human IBD. Successful completion of these experiments will frame the causes and
consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction during IBD, offering the opportunity to improve disease
outcomes by mitigating ongoing inflammation."
10754861,"Project Summary. This proposal responds to PAR-19-253 “Focused Technology Research and
Development”. Our main goal is to develop a novel class of implicit solvation models, as accurate, and even
more accurate, than standard explicit solvent models, but much faster. The high accuracy, fast implicit
solvation models will be combined with several innovative strategies to deliver new computational protocols to
improve accuracy and speed of binding free energies prediction, directly relevant to drug design. We will
develop a computational tool for fast screening of existing and potential multiple simultaneous mutations in the
SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus genome for high affinity to human cells, which translates into high infectivity.
 Progress in modern bio-molecular sciences, from structural biology to structure-based drug design, is
greatly accelerated by atomic-level modeling and simulations that bridge the gap between theory and
experiment. The so-called implicit solvation models can provide critical advantages in speed and versatility
through representing the effects of solvent – often the most computationally expensive part of such simulations
– in a particularly efficient manner. The resulting speed-up of modeling efforts is critical in many areas such as
protein folding or protein-ligand docking; however, the accuracy of the current fast models does not reach the
standard of the more traditional, but computationally very demanding explicit solvent approach. As a result,
prediction reliability of the practical, fast implicit solvation models remains low. In general, high accuracy is a
prerequisite for quantitative in-silico drug design. Here, the accuracy limitation of the current implicit solvation
framework will be addressed in a novel, systematic way; advantages of the new implicit solvation models will
be demonstrated in the context of improving the accuracy of protein-ligand binding free energy calculations.
 We will use a novel approach to systematically add most of the missing explicit solvation effects to the
very basic, but computationally efficient implicit solvation framework of the Poisson and generalized Born (GB)
models, with little computational overhead. The GB model is particularly well suited for molecular dynamics
simulations. We have set high accuracy standards for the new theory: one kT (thermal noise) deviation from
experiment for small molecules hydration, which is better than what most widely used explicit water models,
such as TIP3P, can currently deliver. Based on preliminary results, this goal is within reach. The high accuracy
combined with the expected computational efficiency will usher in the next generation of implicit solvation
models that can make a profound difference in bio-medically relevant atomistic calculations.
 Example of an immediate impact: Close to, or better than, “industry standard” accuracy in protein-
ligand binding calculations, but at a significantly reduced computational expense. Example of a long term
impact: Fast, versatile computational tools to analyze binding of viruses to host cells will increase our
preparedness for future pandemics."
10903884,"Healthy aging of the brain is highly dependent upon a range of protein quality control systems, and such quality
control capacity is often disrupted in neurodegenerative disease. Recently it has come to light that diseased
neurons can transfer toxic products, such as aggregated proteins, to neighboring cells, likely leading to the
spread of pathology within the brain. How neurons generate and send out extracellular material in vivo is a
question that must be addressed as we consider therapeutic intervention. Basic research can inform on
mechanisms relevant to late onset neurodegenerative disease and can suggest avenues of treatment.
Our studies take advantage of the enormous technical advantages in the simple animal model C. elegans
permissive of experimentation that can yield mechanistic insight into neurodegeneration and neuroprotection
biology. With high conservation of molecular function and a naturally transparent body plan, lessons learned
from individual neuronal dynamics directly visualized and measured within the intact adult animal provides high
predictive power for understanding key subcellular processes in more complex systems, including humans.
We discovered that some stressed C. elegans neurons can extrude giant vesicles we call “exophers” that can
be loaded with human disease protein aggregates. Exopher formation dramatically increases upon increased
challenge to protein quality control in those neurons, including over-expressing human Alzheimer’s disease
fragment Aβ1-42 or Huntington’s disease-associated polyQ protein. Aggregated proteins extruded in exophers
are taken up by a glial pruning-like interaction with the neighboring cell, which attempts degradation.
We hypothesize that exopher production is a previously unrecognized alternative route for adult neurons to
clear protein aggregates and damaged organelles. Highly similar processes of giant vesicle budding and
transfer of aggregates, lipids, and damaged organelles have been recently reported in C. elegans muscle,
mouse cardiomyocytes, and mouse and human brain, strongly implying that discoveries we make about how
this process operates in C. elegans will be widely relevant across species, including informing on elusive
spreading mechanisms operating in human brain in neurodegenerative disease.
We propose to exploit the considerable advantages of the C. elegans model (transparent body, facile genetic
manipulation, exquisitely defined nervous system, powerful cell biology, short lifespan) to advance fundamental
understanding of exopher biology. Our goals are to define the genetic and cell biological mechanisms
operative in exopher formation with a focus on the cytoskeletal roles in exophergenesis: 1) define the genetic
and cell biological mechanisms of microtubule dynamics that mediate exopher formation; 2) address how a

 CD8 T-cells recognize and kill virus-infected cells displaying at the cell surface short viral peptides bound
to major histocompatibility (MHC) class I molecules (MHC-I). CD8 T-cells contribute to the clearance of many
viral infections. After an infection subsides, an expanded population of “memory” CD8 T-cells (M CD8 T-cells)
may contribute to more rapidly controlling a secondary infection with the virus. Vaccines can mimic this process.
 Modified mRNA (mmRNA) encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (mmRNA-LNP) have emerged as a
powerful vaccine platform. mmRNA-LNPs have many advantages as vaccines: 1) They can be focused on the
antigen of interest. 2) They are highly immunogenic. 3) they are easy to make. 4) They can be mass-produced
rapidly. 5) They are relatively inexpensive. The swift development and approval of the mmRNA-LNP vaccines to
combat SARS-CoV-2 attest to their potential. While it is known that mmRNA-LNPs induce CD8 T-cell responses,
most of the work on their protection mechanisms has focused on Abs. The mCD8 T-cells induced by mmRNA-
LNP can potentially complement Ab protection or may provide most of the protection for viruses that are
refractory to Ab-mediated control. mmRNA-LNPs could also be used to induce CD8 T-cells against cancer.
 We have published that the mCD8 T-cell responses induced by mmRNA-LNPs protect mice from highly
lethal mousepox, a systemic viral disease of the mouse caused by the Orthopoxvirus (OPV) ectromelia virus
(ECTV). ECTV is an outstanding model for systemic viral infections in general and for OPVs that can infect
humans, such as the eradicated variola virus (virus of smallpox) and for monkeypox virus (MPXV), which recently
caused a major outbreak. In still unpublished experiments, we also found that M CD8 T-cells induced by a mini-
mmRNA vaccine encoding for only the minimal, highly conserved CD8 T-cell epitope VNFNFNGL of the SARS-
CoV-2 Spike protein protects wild-type mice from lethal respiratory infection with the mouse-adapted SARS-
CoV-2 strain MA30, an outstanding model for SARS-CoV-2 and other grave respiratory infections. Here we
propose elucidating the mechanisms whereby mmRNA-LNPs induce protective mCD8 T-cells using the ECTV
systemic and the MA30 SARS-CoV-2 respiratory mouse models. Our Specific Aims are to: A) Specific Aim 1.
Investigate the Mechanisms of MHC-I antigen presentation after mmRNA-LNP vaccination. B) Specific Aim 2.
Investigate the roles of Type I interferon (IFN-I) and other proinflammatory cytokines in protective M CD8 T-cell
development after mRNA-LNP vaccination."
10928822,"Youth who are assigned female at birth (AFAB) and identify as transgender (e.g., as non-binary or as
trans boys), not as girls, are at risk for negative sexual health outcomes yet are effectively excluded from
sexual health programs because gender-diverse youth do not experience the cisgender, heteronormative teen
sexual education messaging available to them as salient or applicable. This lack of programming is likely
contributing to obstacles to sexual health: Data suggest that AFAB trans-identified youth may be less likely to
use condoms when having sex with people who have penises and are at least as likely as cisgender girls to be
pregnant. This health inequity must be addressed.
 Access to inclusive sexual education, condoms, and sexual health support can vary widely across
regions of the US, and within states for those living in rural versus urban settings. This is particularly true now
that states have more influence on adolescents’ access to sexual health services and gender-affirming care.
Our comprehensive sexual health program will be developed nationally for maximal impact.
 The foundation for this R01 proposal is our work with Girl2Girl, a text messaging-based sexual health
program designed for cisgender sexual minority girls 14-18 years of age. In an RCT of 948 LGB+ girls,
Girl2Girl was associated with higher rates of condom-protected penile-vaginal sex (f2=.11) and use of
birth control other than condoms (f2=.13)
at 12 months post-intervention.
 We propose to adapt Girl2Girl to address social and structural influences of sexual behavior of AFAB
trans-identified youth, including significant social stressors, discrimination, dysphoria and rejection. In so doing,
this proposal addresses the National Institute of Nursing Research’s (NINR) research lens on HEALTH
EQUITY. It also speaks to NINR’s research lens on PREVENTION AND HEALTH PROMOTION across the
prevention continuum by including both sexually experienced and inexperienced youth. Specifically, we aim to:
 Specific Aim 1: With ongoing feedback from trans-identified youth assigned female at birth,
adapt Girl2Girl for gender inclusivity to create #TranscendentHealth. First, we will conduct focus groups
(n=80) to identify and give voice to the contexts that affect sexual decision making of AFAB trans-identified
youth. After adapting the content, we will conduct Content Advisory Teams (CATs; n=50) to ensure that
program content resonates with these youth. Finally, we will conduct a beta test (n=22) to confirm the protocol.
 Specific Aim 2: Test the resulting adaptation in a national RCT of 700 trans-identified AFAB
youth 14-18 years of age. Our main outcome measures will be: 1) Rates of condom-protected sex, 2) use of
other types of birth control methods (e.g., the shot, IUDs) other than condoms, 3) HIV/STI testing, and 4) PreP
uptake for those for whom it is indicated. Secondary measures also will include pregnancy, and intentions to:
1) use condoms, 2) uptake other birth control methods, 3) test for STIs and 4) uptake PrEP."

Background. Combination inhaled-corticosteroid/long-acting beta-agonist (ICS/LABA) inhalers are a mainstay
for controlling respiratory conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
These inhaled medications can be delivered to the patient with a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) or a dry-powder
inhaler (DPI). Although the active ingredients of MDI and DPI inhalers are similar, the mode of drug delivery is
different, and there are limited real-world data on their comparative effectiveness. Additionally, MDIs have a
disproportionate environmental toll because they use hydrofluorocarbon aerosol propellants with high global
warming potential. A global phase-down of hydrofluorocarbons to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will likely
result in disruptions to the inhaler aerosol market, further underscoring the importance of developing evidence-
based guidelines to inform clinical decision-making. A 2021 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) national
formulary change provides a unique opportunity to assess both the clinical outcomes and the net
environmental impacts of a switch from MDI to DPI inhalers in a national cohort of adults with a high burden of
respiratory disease. Specific Aims: (A1) Test the real-world clinical effectiveness of metered-dose vs dry-
powder ICS/LABA controller inhaler therapy. (A2) Identify patient and facility factors associated with successful
conversion from MDI to DPI controller therapy. (A3) Estimate the greenhouse gas emissions avoided under a
variety of inhaler prescribing scenarios. Impact: Our results will assess the impact of the 2021 VHA formulary
change on 181,524 Veterans impacted by the 2021 VHA formulary change and inform optimal inhaler
prescribing to maximize control of common respiratory diseases while minimizing the environmental impact of
care. Innovation: Our study is innovative because it leverages a large natural experiment (2021 VHA
formulary change) and addresses under-studied topics (real-world clinical effectiveness of MDI vs DPI therapy;
the climate impact of healthcare). Methods: In a national cohort of 181,524 patients switched from metered-
dose to dry-powder ICS/LABA under the 2021 VHA formulary change, we will use a within-person study design
to test the clinical effectiveness of metered-dose vs dry-powder ICS/LABA therapy. Clinical outcomes will
include albuterol fills, prednisone fills, and healthcare utilization. We will identify patient and facility factors
associated with successful conversion from MDI to DPI controller therapy using a sequential mixed methods
study design. We will complete life-cycle assessments to quantify the environmental impact of inhalers on the
VHA formulary; calculate the greenhouse gas emissions averted by the VHA formulary change; and estimate
the greenhouse gas emissions that could be avoided under a variety of scenarios for optimizing inhaler
therapy."
10756073,"ABSTRACT
The development of type II diabetes (T2D) is strongly associated with obesity, and both are well-established risk
factors for cardiovascular disease. Vascular dysfunction is an early event in developing cardiovascular disease
in obese diabetic (OB-T2D) patients. Therefore, we set our long-term goal to define molecular mechanisms of
vascular dysfunction and corrective strategies that target these mechanisms, such as physical activity and weight
loss. We recently discovered that human adipose tissues release extracellular vesicles (adiposomes) that are
efficiently captured by endothelial cells. Adiposomes are known to carry bioactive cargos such as proteins and
micro RNAs; however, their lipid content has not been studied, neither their ability to transfer their lipid cargo to
endothelial cells. In the current application, we propose investigating the role of adiposomes in communicating
the unhealthy milieu, mainly dysregulated lipids, to endothelial cells in OB-T2D subjects. On top of these lipid
species that we propose to be carried by adiposomes are glycosphingolipids (GSLs). GSLs originate from
ceramide glycosylation, a chemical process that is upregulated in the presence of inflammation and high glucose
levels. Our preliminary findings showed that in endothelial cells, GSL-rich adiposomes disturb plasma membrane
structure and subsequently induces endothelial dysfunction. Moreover, we found preconditioning endothelial
cells with high shear stress (which is an exercise mimetic) protected endothelial cells from the detrimental effects
caused by adiposomes. Therefore, our central hypothesis is that adipose tissues in OB-T2D patients release
GSL-loaded adiposomes that induce vascular endothelial dysfunction. We propose that exercise and weight loss
interventions (bariatric surgery) will restore adipose tissue homeostasis, reduce GSL-loaded adiposomes, and
subsequently alleviate vascular risk in OB-T2D patients. We will test our hypotheses by pursuing the following
Aims: Aim 1: Investigate the role of GSL-rich adiposomes in the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction in OB-
T2D adults; Aim 2: Test the effectiveness of exercise training in reducing adiposome-mediated effects on
vascular function; and Aim 3: Examine changes in adiposome/caveolae axis following metabolic surgery and
their association with vascular function. This study will improve our mechanistic understanding of the biological
underpinning of adiposome production, packaging, and role in inducing ED under conditions of obesity and T2D.
It will also identify adiposomes and the proposed mechanisms of their interaction with endothelial cells as novel
therapeutic targets for improving vascular function in OB-T2D individuals. Once these pathways are elucidated,
strategies for targeting them can be advanced, leading to an improved therapeutic management of T2D-related
cardiovascular disease."
10756074,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome and a predominant cause of
mortality in adults. The overall objective of this renewal is to continue to elucidate the mechanism of action
of the myosin binding protein-C (MyBP-C) family of proteins on cardiac function. MyBP-C proteins regulate
contractile structure and function in both cardiac and skeletal muscles. The present proposal is focused on
defining the role of one of the MyBP-C proteins, fast myosin binding protein-C (fMyBP-C), as a negative
regulator of cardiac contractility. fMyBP-C is minimally expressed at baseline in the heart but is significantly
increased in the cardiomyocytes during HF. In the pilot studies, a novel transgenic mouse that expresses
fMyBP-C (fMyBP-CTg) specifically in cardiomyocytes and at levels similar to those observed in HF develops
cardiac hypertrophy, decreased maximal force and reduced myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity. In contrast,
homozygous fMyBP-C knockout (fMyBP-CKO) mice, when challenged with transverse aortic coarctation
(TAC)-induced pressure overload, shows significantly improved cardiac function, compared to controls.
Furthermore, in vitro studies revealed that fMyBP-C negatively modulates cardiomyocyte contractility by
increasing super-relaxed state of myosin, actomyosin interactions and thin filament activation. However,
the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of fMyBP-C and, in turn, its impact on
sarcomere function, are completely unknown.
 On the basis of the preliminary findings, our central hypothesis is that fMyBP-C upregulation
reduces cardiac function during HF by reducing actomyosin interactions, preventing thin and thick filament
interactions and decreasing the rate of force generation, resulting in contractile dysfunction and HF.
SPECIFIC AIM 1 will use a novel fMyBP-CTg mouse model to determine the sufficiency of fMyBP-C
expression in the cardiomyocytes in reducing cardiac contractility, actomyosin interactions and cross-
bridges and developing HF, compared to controls, including cMyBP-C transgenic and null mice. Using the
fMyBP-CKO mice, SPECIFIC AIM 2 will define the necessity of fMyBP-C to exacerbate (TAC)-induced
pressure overload HF using fMyBP-CKO mice, compared to controls. In the same aim, a novel Mybpc2-
mScarlet (fluorescence) knock-in mouse model will be used to fate map fMyBP-C expression during TAC-
induced pressure overload. Using these mouse models, SPECIFIC AIM 3 will elucidate the molecular
mechanism(s) underlying reduced cardiac contractility using cardiomyocytes from the fMyBP-CTg and
fMyBP-CKO mice, as well as recombinant proteins and chimeras of cMyBP-C/fMyBP-C, on various
biophysical, biochemical and functional studies in vitro, compared to wild-type controls. Together, these
studies will determine the necessity and sufficiency of fMyBP-C to negatively regulate inotropy and cause
HF. The results will lead to the identification of potential therapeutic targets to treat HF."

 Severe complications after thoracic surgery are common and lead to increased readmissions and
mortality. The early symptoms of developing complications may not be detected by the usual scheduled
postoperative care before they worsen and become severe. Postoperative care can be done remotely and in
real-time with automated systems that electronically deliver surveys to patients to directly capture patient-
reported outcomes and send alerts to providers for concerning responses (ePROs). ePROs improve quality
of life, healthcare utilization, and survival in several large clinical trials as well as have emerging evidence of
clinical effectiveness in real-world applications in oncology patients. ePROs also have been shown to be
feasible for symptom management in small trials of thoracic and colorectal surgery patients. These data
suggest ePROs have the potential to improve care after thoracic and other high-risk surgery. However, there
are no widely implemented ePRO systems in routine surgical care, despite evidence from other settings to
support the value of systematically identifying and then addressing anticipated barriers to implementation in
the ePRO design. Current gaps in knowledge to designing ePROs for use in surgical care include identifying
optimal survey/alert features and workflow, barriers to routine use, and clinical effectiveness.
 The candidate for this career development award, Dr. Mody, is a thoracic surgeon whose career goal
is to improve clinical and patient-centered outcomes for patients with chronic lung conditions requiring
surgery. The proposed award will build on her prior MPH that included formal training in biostatistics and
health services research and will provide advanced training in areas necessary for her to achieve her career
goals. Specifically, during the award period Dr. Mody will receive training in qualitative data analysis including
mixed methods and implementation science research methods. Dr. Mody will perform a prospective study of
implementation and effectiveness outcomes in thoracic surgery clinics using postoperative ePROs. To ensure
her success, an interdisciplinary team of mentors and advisors with complementary expertise have been
enlisted including Dr. Ethan Basch (clinical trials in oncology, PRO research), Dr. Jennifer Leeman
(implementation, qualitative research), Dr. Antonia Bennett (quality of life measurement, qualitative research),
Dr. Andrea Pusic (clinical trials in surgery, PRO research), Dr. Angela Smith (surgery, health information
technology for PRO measurement), and Dr. Angela Stover (implementation of PROs). By the end of the
award period, Dr. Mody will have the necessary preliminary data and training to successfully perform a large
scale randomized controlled trial to evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of an ePRO system in
cardiothoracic surgery patients. Designing and evaluating such a system in thoracic surgery patients first is
important as they serve as a model for the increasing numbers of medically complex patients requiring
invasive treatments for chronic conditions and for whom ePROs may substantially improve outcomes."

The human flu virus undergoes fast antigenic evolution driven by the challenge of the host immune system.
Circulating viruses are a moving quasi-species of high genetic and antigenic diversity, which is structured in
distinct clades representing niches with separate avenues of escape from human herd immunity. Specifically,
viral-immune co-evolution follows a Red Queen’s dynamical pattern of competing lineages, which is further
modulated by global transmission patterns, host population structure, and herd-immunity acquired by previous
infections and vaccination. This process poses a challenge for vaccine strain selection: to determine a single
strain from each of the four seasonal lineages to provide the best protection from the viruses that are expected
to dominate almost a year in advance.
Here we posit that shape and dynamics of the global viral population can be understood and predicted from the
underlying human population immunity. In this project, we will develop a comprehensive and objective
computational approach to provide a mechanistic understanding of the influenza virus-host immune interaction
on the host level, to quantify the selection imposed on the virus on the global evolutionary scales. Specifically, we
will build biophysical models, both for the B-cell and T-cell driven immune recognition of epitopes in a host, to
accurately characterize the immune structure of the human population to best represent the fitness effects acting
on the virus on the global scale. For the model of B-cell immune recognition (Aim 1), we will leverage diverse
antigenic human serology assays to prepare a detailed map of antigenic effects of mutations and epistatic
interactions. The data will be cross-mapped on the dataset of sequences of globally circulating viruses and our
detailed phylogenies for each of the four seasonal lineages. The T-cell immune recognition (Aim 2) will be based
on computational machine learning predictions of epitopes, combined with novel biophysically motivated models
for prediction of immunodominant antigens. Host population geographically diverse HLA diversity will be
accounted for estimating selective pressures imposed on the population of the virus.
These components, together with a component describing the selective pressure due to previous vaccinations,
will be used to optimize a joint fitness model (Aim 3). Information theoretic approaches will be used to optimize
and evaluate the predictive power of the combined model. We will objectively quantify the significance of each of
the components and validate the predictions on the historical sequence and epidemiological data. With the
resulting fitness model we will define principled criteria for vaccine strain selection, to optimize the coverage and
efficacy of the vaccine in the future populations of the of seasonal human influenza viruses."
10915440,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Next generation sequencing technologies have greatly expanded the size of the known transcriptome. Many
newly discovered transcripts are classified as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) which are assumed to influence
phenotype through sequence and structure and not via translated protein products, despite the vast majority of
them harboring short open reading frames (sORFs). Recent advances have demonstrated that the noncoding
designation is incorrect in many cases and that sORF-encoded peptides (SEPs also called micropeptides)
translated from these transcripts are important contributors to diverse biological processes including
inflammation and cell viability. An appropriate inflammatory response is critical for host defense against
pathogens, but chronic inflammation is associated with many diseases. Macrophages play a significant role in
both initiating and resolving inflammation and understanding their part in this process is scientifically and
practically important. One long studied - yet not fully understood - model of macrophage proinflammatory
polarization involves lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Following detection of
LPS, a signaling cascade initiates leading to the translocation of transcription factor NFkB to the nucleus. This
is followed by increased expression of established inflammatory cytokine and interferon genes. However, this
also results in changes in expression of many unstudied lncRNAs. In addition to changes in transcription,
changes in translation also follow inflammatory stimulation and these alterations have been observed to
increase translation of “noncoding” regions in some cases. Indeed our lab and others have observed dramatic
changes in associations between lncRNAs and polysomes following LPS stimulation in mouse macrophages.
Therefore, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that translation of lncRNAs produce SEPs that
play important roles in the TLR4-NFkB inflammatory response and in macrophage viability. To test this
hypothesis, I present a strategy for screening lncRNA sORFs with evidence of coding potential in mouse
macrophages. The screen will make use of macrophage cell lines with a NFkB-GFP reporter and CRISPR-
Cas9 casssette. Secondly, I propose a biomolecular pipeline for mechanistically characterizing a selection of
novel SEPs. This work has the potential to identify many novel SEPs that are important for regulating the
inflammatory response. This would further our understanding of a model inflammatory pathway and could help
identify novel peptides with therapeutic potential or as therapeutic targets."

 Sexual minority women consume alcohol, experience alcohol-related problems, and suffer from mental
health problems at higher rates than do their heterosexual peers. Although several clinical programs are being
developed for sexual minority women (SMW) seeking treatment for these problems, only a small proportion of
SMW needing it ever seek treatment. Meanwhile, preventive interventions able to avoid these problems by
reducing drinking and improving psychological well-being among non-treatment seeking SMW have been slow
to emerge. The proposed research builds on R21AA025767, which established the preliminary feasibility and
effectiveness of delivering personalized normative feedback on drinking and coping behaviors to SMW within a
broader app-based social competition designed to challenge harmful stereotypes about this population and
foster a supportive virtual community. In our pilot trial, sexual minority women enthusiastically engaged with the
app in the absence of participation incentives for doing so. Further, relative to a sub-sample that received PNF
on control topics within the competition, those who received PNF on drinking and coping substantially reduced
their consumption and negative consequences over a 4-month period. Moreover, qualitative feedback
suggested that negative stereotype disconfirming PNF and social media inspired community features (present
across conditions) may have also provided psychological benefits beyond the alcohol and coping PNF
evaluated. To build on these promising findings and remedy limitations, this research proposes to first optimize
the app based on feedback from participants in the pilot trial (AIM1) and then conduct a large, sophisticated,
Type I implementation-effectiveness trial to simultaneously examine the effects of the fully featured app on
drinking, alcohol-related problems, and psychological well-being relative to a limited feature psychoeducational
control version of the app (AIM2), identify explanatory psychological mechanisms associated with the fully
featured app’s effectiveness (AIM3), elucidate demographic and sexual minority stigma-related moderators
(AIM4), and examine engagement, acceptability, and sustainability of use under real world conditions among a
sub-sample of unincentivized, fully featured app users (AIM 5)."
10864805,"ABSTRACT
A significant number of individuals with alcohol use disorder struggle to maintain sobriety as a result of withdrawal
symptoms that emerge during early abstinence. Despite this, the neural mechanisms underlying symptoms of
withdrawal are not well understood. The rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) is a GABAergic region that
plays a critical role in avoidance behavior, aversive signaling, pain, and importantly, alcohol-related behaviors.
Recent work from our lab provides evidence of RMTg hyperactivity during acute withdrawal from chronic
intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure. In addition, we showed that pharmacological inhibition of the RMTg
attenuates withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behavior. The afferents that drive RMTg-mediated withdrawal
symptoms are currently unknown. However, previously published studies have implicated the lateral habenula
(LHb) – a region that provides dense input to the RMTg – in withdrawal-induced negative affect similar to our
work in the RMTg. In addition, our preliminary data revealed significant cFos induction in RMTg-projecting LHb
neurons during acute withdrawal in CIE-exposed rats compared to AIR controls. Interestingly, the LHb is heavily
enriched in mu-opioid receptors (MORs), which are known to regulate both pain and affect. Oprm1, the gene
that encodes MOR, is hypermethylated in individuals with AUD suggestive of a potential mechanism by which
chronic ethanol exposure drives decreases in Oprm1 expression. However, the effect of withdrawal on MORs in
the LHb is unclear. Together, these data lead us to hypothesize that LHb afferents to the RMTg are
mechanistically involved in withdrawal from chronic ethanol and that epigenetic dysregulation of the Oprm1 gene
may contribute to this mechanism. Three specific aims will be used to test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, in vivo
chemogenetics will be used to determine whether selective inhibition of RMTg-projecting LHb neurons reverses
symptoms of withdrawal. Oprm1 expression and methylation levels will be assessed in RMTg-projecting LHb
neurons in Aim 2 using fluorescent in situ hybridization and MethylMiner. Tract tracing will be combined with ex
vivo whole-cell patch-clamp slice electrophysiology in Aim 3 to investigate withdrawal-induced changes in
epigenetic regulation of MOR receptor-mediated firing in RMTg-projecting LHb neurons. These studies will
provide the applicant with new training in cutting-edge neuroscience techniques while also providing new insight
into the role of the LHb-RMTg circuit in ethanol withdrawal."

Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) is the pathogen that causes the world’s most common bacterial sexually transmitted
infection, with over 129 million cases in 2020. Untreated urogenital Ct can have severe sequelae, including
pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, tubal factor infertility, epididymitis, urethritis, and prostatitis.
Untreated anorectal Ct can lead to proctitis, ulcerations, abscesses, fissures, and fistulas. Anorectal infections
likely also act as a reservoir for the bacterium, in which urogenital infection occurs via autoinoculation. Most Ct
research has focused on female urogenital infections, as these infections more commonly cause severe
sequelae. However, there is a large gap and an urgent need to study Ct infections in males. Although male
urogenital tract infections are less likely to lead to severe sequelae, males can transmit infection to the female
reproductive tract, which is more vulnerable to complications. Additionally, anorectal infections occur in men
who have sex with men, men who have sex with women and in women. Current treatment is curative antibiotics,
but these do not prevent reinfection, do not robustly clear infection at all anatomic sites, and can have poor
patient compliance. Identifying strategies to reduce and prevent transmission of Ct, as well as limit infection, is
very urgent. Our lab has developed vaccines against Chlamydia using highly immunogenic bacteriophage virus-
like particles (VLPs) as a platform displaying short peptide epitopes of Ct adhesion factors in an immunogenic
manner. In particular, our Qb-VD4-MOMP vaccine, targeting Ct adhesion factor Major Outer Membrane Protein,
provides protection in female mice. However, the anorectal tract and male urogenital tract have distinct
immunological environments, and Ct infections at these sites are not well studied. This F31 proposal aims to
investigate the ability of our Qb-VD4-MOMP vaccine to protect against Chlamydia infection in male mice. The
overall goal of this proposed research is to determine the immunogenicity and protective ability of these vaccines
in male mice, utilizing urogenital, anorectal, and sexual transmission infection models. The outcome of this
research will highlight the populations that will benefit from vaccination by preventing both infection and
transmission. Aim 1 will investigate vaccine efficacy in male mice urogenitally or anorectally infected with
Chlamydia. Additionally, vaccine efficacy in the context of immunization of either or both partners will be
investigated in mouse sexual transmission models of Chlamydia (Aim 2). These vaccines may or may not elicit
the same protection in males as in females, and the use of adjuvants, mixed vaccines, or alternative vaccine
targets may be necessary to provide protection in males. Overall, this research will reveal important aspects of
vaccine-mediated protection and advance these vaccines closer to human clinical trials."

patient management. CT can be used to robustly obtain global measures of function in adult rTOF patients, but
regional dysfunction is not currently quantified. Strain evaluation can be limited by changes in ventricular
geometry and dyssynchronous contraction, both of which are common in rTOF patients. Myocardial work (MW)
– clinically measured as the ventricular pressure-strain loop area – can overcome this concern, as it is closely
related to myocardial perfusion and has been shown to be more independent of loading conditions. However,
ventricular pressure measurements do not capture regional heterogeneities in myocardial stress and the
impact of this approximation has not been explored. Further, the clinical utility of MW to detect early RV
dysfunction in rTOF patients with CT has not been established.
We have recently developed MWCT, an estimate of regional MW that combines regional endocardial strain
measurements from ECG-gated CT (RSCT) and RV pressure waveforms. The proposed project aims to
investigate MWCT as a quantitative tool to capture regions of subclinical dysfunction in adult rTOF patients. The
ability for MWCT to detect regional dysfunction will be compared to advanced MW estimates derived from finite-
element models of regional endocardial stress and RSCT. This aim will establish the simple, pressure based
MWCT estimate as an effective tool for characterizing regional RV performance. Further, this aim will compare
FE methods and establish an approach to measure MW as the endocardial stress-strain loop area within our
MWCT pipeline. Cross-sectional CT imaging will assess whether well-performing areas on MWCT agree with
cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) findings better than strain alone. Additionally, longitudinal evaluation via
functional class and CT imaging will be performed to assess whether the amount of discordant endocardium
(disagreement between regional work and strain measurements) corresponds with worsening symptomatology
and dysfunction respectively. This aim will demonstrate that capturing early dysfunction will improve clinical
care by detecting adverse remodeling prior to global changes. The long-term goal of this proposal is to
establish CT as a feasible method for evaluating regional RV function and develop robust quantitative tools for
early detection of dysfunction in all rTOF survivors."

In the past decade, opioid use disorders have significantly increased in pregnant women and women of
childbearing age. In parallel, we have seen a drastic rise in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS).
Despite having well-defined, short-term phenotypic symptoms for NOWS, molecular effects and long-term
consequences are incomprehensible. This is of particular concern given that opioid exposure alone, as well as
withdrawal, can induce inflammation in the brain, and recent work has shown an increase in pro-inflammatory
cytokines and chemokines, which may be promoted by reactive glia as a result of in utero opioid exposure.
Moreover, cognitive functioning and memory deficits have been observed in preclinical models of in utero
opioid exposure, and intellectual impairments and increased attention disorders have been observed in clinical
populations previously diagnosed with NOWS. While much of the research has focused on inflammation and in
utero opioid exposure in brain regions associated with reward and cognition, less is known about the brain
regions associated with withdrawal symptoms in NOWS, and how this may relate to cognitive function later in
life. Understanding the pro-inflammatory effects of in utero opioid exposure and withdrawal may allow for novel
targets for the treatment of NOWS, and better understanding of long-term consequences. Therefore, by using
an established rat model of NOWS that has previously shown an upregulation of inflammatory markers due to
in utero opioid exposure, we will investigate inflammation in a withdrawal-associated brain region, the locus
coeruleus, and determine effects on behavioral indices of withdrawal and subsequent cognitive function. More
specifically, in a rat model of NOWS, we will utilize immunohistochemistry, qPCR, and multiplex assays to
evaluate inflammatory markers including reactive glial cells, toll-like receptor 4 expression, and levels of pro-
inflammatory cytokines and associated neuropeptides, and their respective associations with quantified
behavioral withdrawal symptoms. In addition, we will test the specific role of reactive glia on physical
withdrawal symptoms in the rat neonate by systemically administering the glia-inhibiting agent, minocycline.
We will assess the resultant cognitive function at PN21 and PN60, when rats are considered preadolescent
and early adulthood, respectively. We will test spatial learning and memory in heroin- or saline-exposed rat
pups who experienced precipitated withdrawal at PN10. Additional experiments will also include the use of
neonatal, systemic minocycline administration to mitigate cognitive deficits previously observed in preclinical
and clinical populations of NOWS. Together, these experiments will allow us to better understand the effects of
inflammation on physical withdrawal symptoms, as well as the relationship between physical withdrawal
symptoms and subsequent cognitive function, as a result of in utero opioid exposure and precipitated
withdrawal, thereby establishing novel targets for the treatment of NOWS and laying the foundation for future
studies evaluating its long-term consequences."

Antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections pose a substantial and growing threat to human health. There is a
pressing need to characterize new antibacterial targets and to develop methods that enable discovery and
characterization of inhibitors for these targets. The research described here focuses on understanding late
steps in the assembly of the peptidoglycan cell wall that surrounds bacterial cells. The cell wall is essential for
bacterial survival, making it an outstanding target for antibiotics. Indeed, some of the most important antibiotics
in history, the beta-lactams and the glycopeptides, target late steps in peptidoglycan assembly. Historically, the
enzymes that catalyze these late steps have been extremely difficult to study due to the nature of the
substrates that are required, the products that are formed, and the fact that many peptidoglycan biosynthetic
enzymes are polytopic membrane proteins or function only when complexed to a membrane protein. Recent
technological innovations made in our labs have advanced the field of peptidoglycan biosynthesis
considerably, and we are able to pursue challenging targets that have not previously been studied. This project
has four aims. Aim 1 involves further development of chemical tools to enable mechanistic and structural
studies of cell wall biosynthetic enzymes. Aim 2 focuses on understanding MurJ, the flippase that exports the
peptidoglycan precursor Lipid II from the cytoplasm to the cell surface where it is polymerized to produce
peptidoglycan. Aim 3 focuses on characterizing FtsW, the only universally conserved peptidoglycan
polymerase in bacteria. Aim 4 focuses on two novel Staphylococcus aureus cell wall hydrolase complexes that
process uncrosslinked peptidoglycan before it is integrated into the cell wall. These four aims will provide
fundamental information on how the bacterial cell wall is built. The studies will also provide new chemical tools,
assays, and scientific knowledge to enable the discovery of inhibitors that may be useful for treating resistant
bacterial infections."
10752679,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Effector and regulatory T cells targeting the central nervous system (CNS) play a pivotal role in the
pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and its model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).
Dendritic cells (DCs) control CNS-specific T cells, but the pathways regulating DC function are poorly
characterized. Published studies suggest a role for the ligand-activated transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon
receptor (AHR) in the control of DCs. During the previous grant cycle we have made the following findings: 1)
Deletion of AHR expressed in classical DCs (AHRcDC) worsens EAE and exacerbates autoimmune T-cell
responses, 2) Single-cell RNA-seq analyses of mouse and human classical DCs (cDCs) detected the
coordinated expression of AHR with the transcription factor KLF4 and the ectoenzyme CD39, 3) Indeed, AHRcDC
drives the expression of KLF4 in cDCs (KLF4cDC), a transcription factor known to limit NF-kB activation and drive
anti-inflammatory gene expression in macrophages, 4) KLF4cDC deletion worsens EAE and exacerbates
pathogenic T-cell responses, 5) AHRcDC also drives the expression of CD39 in cDCs (CD39cDC), which degrades
pro-inflammatory extracellular ATP (eATP) and participates in the synthesis of anti-inflammatory adenosine, 5)
CD39cDC deletion worsens EAE and exacerbates pathogenic T-cell responses, 6) AHR activation induces mouse
and human tolerogenic cDCs, and 7) A novel probiotic engineered to produce the AHR agonist IAA (named
EcNIAA) suppresses EAE in an AHRcDC-dependent manner. Based on these findings we hypothesize that
AHRcDC-driven KLF4 and CD39 expression in cDCs limits CNS autoimmunity. Our specific aims are:
Specific Aim 1: DETERMINE THE ROLE OF KLF4 IN THE CONTROL OF cDCS BY AHRcDC.
We propose to: 1) Define KLF4-dependent and KLF4-independent transcriptional programs controlled by AHRcDC
in single cell and bulk genomic studies, and 2) Establish the role of KLF4 in the control of NF-kB by AHR in cDCs.
Specific Aim 2: ESTABLISH THE ROLE OF CD39 IN THE CONTROL OF T CELLS BY AHRcDC.
We propose to: 1) Define the effects of AHRcDC-induced CD39cDC expression on myelin-specific T cells, 2)
Determine whether the AHRcDC-CD39cDC axis promotes regulatory T cell differentiation, and 3) Establish the roles
of AHRcDC, KLF4cDC and CD39cDC in the control of T cells by DCs in healthy controls and MS patients.
Specific Aim 3: DEFINE THE ROLE OF AHRcDC IN EAE SUPPRESSION BY EcNIAA.
This aim evaluates the therapeutic potential of activating AHRcDC with EcNIAA, a novel probiotic engineered to
produce the AHR agonist IAA. We propose to: 1) Evaluate the therapeutic effects of EcNIAA in EAE, 2) Define
the roles of AHRcDC and KLF4cDC on the transcriptional modulation of DCs by EcNIAA, 3) Establish the contribution
of AHRcDC and CD39cDC to the control of effector and regulatory T cells by EcNIAA.
IN SUMMARY, in this competitive renewal we use unique tools and clinical samples to study a novel aspect of
AHRcDC as a regulator of T-cell autoimmunity, and its potential as a therapeutic target in autoimmune diseases."

Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent L-type (CaV1.2) channels into cardiomyocytes is a multi-dimensional
signal that mediates excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling, controls action potential duration, and regulates gene
expression. Dysregulation of CaV1.2 causes heart disease, the leading cause of death in the US and worldwide.
β-adrenergic up-regulation of CaV1.2 underlies the positive inotropic response essential for the fight or flight
response. Despite decades of intense focus, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying β-adrenergic up-
regulation of Ca2+ influx via CaV1.2 in cardiomyocytes remained elusive and controversial. In the last funding
period, using an ascorbate-peroxidase (APEX2)-proximity-labeling method, we discovered that under basal
conditions the Ca2+ channel inhibitor Rad, a small G-protein, is enriched near CaV1.2 but is depleted upon
exposure to a β-adrenergic agonist. Our findings fundamentally recast the mechanism for β-adrenergic
regulation of CaV1.2: under basal conditions, Rad inhibits a sub-population of CaV1.2 in cardiomyocytes; upon
adrenergic activation, protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates Rad and relieves this inhibition to increase whole-
cell L-type current (ICa,L). The implications of this new model are profound and raise a slew of fundamental
questions that we are uniquely poised to address based on several innovative approaches we have developed
and insights we have attained in the last funding cycle. This renewal application is motivated by the overall
hypotheses that deepened understanding of the precise mechanisms underlying kinase regulation of CaV1.2 via
Rad will not only provide fundamental new insights into cardiac physiology in the fight or flight response and
beyond, but may also be exploited to develop novel positive inotropic agents to combat heart disease. We
combine innovative approaches developed in the Marx (proximity labeling proteomics, knockin mouse models)
and Colecraft (nanobody-based targeted regulation of CaV1.2) labs to address three specific Aims. 1) Elucidate
mechanisms and determinants underlying Rad targeting to CaV1.2 in heart and β-adrenergic regulation of ICa,L.
2) Elucidate mechanisms and physiological role of kinase-phosphatase balance regulation of basal CaV1.2 in
cardiomyocytes. 3) Engineer the kinase-phosphatase balance in the CaV1.2 nanodomain using targeted
recruitment of kinases."

Yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood, thwarting the development of improved treatments.
While the etiology of internalizing illness is undoubtedly complex and multifactorial, emerging evidence motivates
the overarching hypothesis that aberrant neural processing of Threat and Safety independently confer increased
risk for internalizing illnesses. This work suggests that: (a) hyper-reactivity to Uncertain Threat anticipation
increases risk, (b) deficient Safety Signaling increases risk, and (c) these associations are magnified by
exposure to Negative Life Events (NLEs). Archival data from the Maryland iRisk Study provide an optimal
platform for rigorously addressing these fundamental gaps. iRisk is a recently completed prospective-longitudinal
study focused on a racially diverse, sex-balanced sample of emerging adults enriched for internalizing risk. At
enrollment, fMRI and a well-established Threat-anticipation task were used to quantify reactivity to Uncertain
and Certain Shock-Threat, as well as Safety. Reactivity to a popular emotion-perception (‘threat-related’ faces)
task was also assessed. Smartphone ecological momentary assessment (EMA) was used to intensively probe
daily experience at 0, 6, 24, and 30 months, providing an unprecedented multi-year assessment of mood
dynamics and a first opportunity to assess the real-world significance of Threat and Safety brain circuitry. At
each wave, mood, symptoms, function, and social support were also assessed. Diagnoses, dimensional
symptoms, and NLEs were assessed using gold-standard interviews at 0, 15, and 30 months. These data will
enable me to (1) understand the relevance of Threat and Safety circuity to the emergence of internalizing
symptoms/diagnoses, (2) understand their role in the emergence of more etiologically proximal pathology-
promoting feelings and behaviors in daily life, and (3) explore the relative predictive merits of a genuinely
distressing Threat-anticipation task vs. a widely used Threat-perception (emotional-faces) task. Impact.
Internalizing illnesses are a leading cause of human misery and morbidity. This project would provide a
potentially transformative opportunity to deepen our understanding of etiology and refine clinical science theory.
It would inform the development of mechanistic models in humans and animals, and provide a quantitative
rationale for prioritizing new biological and psychosocial targets for therapeutics development and repurposing,
including scalable mHealth approaches. This project builds on my strong computational and neuroimaging skills,
my extensive experience with practical aspects of study implementation, and my preliminary experiences
working with EMA data. It would provide an exceptional vehicle for training in state-of-the-art analytic
approaches, EMA data collection and best-practices, internalizing illness, and research ethics; and for
developing the cutting-edge research program, professional skills, and publication record necessary to flourish
as an independent clinical affective neuroscientist."

A large number of studies over the last 14 years show that orexin neurons play an important role in reward
processing and drug abuse. Although these studies show that orexin-1 receptor (OxR1) signaling is particularly
involved in the motivation for many drugs of abuse, none have linked this system to the persistent, chronically
relapsing nature of addiction. Here, we extend studies from the previous terms of this project to tackle this
important issue. We recently found that the intermittent access (IntA) cocaine self-administration paradigm
produces a strong, multiphenotype addiction-like state as well as increased numbers of orexin-expressing
neurons. Importantly we find that the IntA-induced increase in addiction behaviors and orexin expression are
persistent (>30d of abstinence). We also find that chronic administration of an OxR1 antagonist during IntA
blocks the increased demand that this paradigm normally produces. Here, we propose to more fully characterize
the IntA-linked addiction profile and induced-orexin neurons following 30d abstinence. We also will examine the
contribution of OxR1 and OxR2 signaling in ventral tegmental area (VTA) and paraventricular thalamus (PVT),
two reward-related areas previously linked to orexin function, in persistent addiction behaviors after IntA. Finally,
we will test whether the FDA-approved dual orexin receptor antagonist, Belsomra™ (suvorexant), is effective in
acutely decreasing addiction behaviors, and in preventing the transition from a moderate to a severe addiction
profile. Together, the proposed experiments are a natural and important extension of the prior studies in this
project and will represent an important step forward in the development of an orexin-based treatment for cocaine
addiction."

Obesity is a key risk factor for many secondary chronic illnesses, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular
disease. Canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling is well-established as an important regulator of mesenchymal cell
fate determination and differentiation, inhibiting adipogenesis and promoting osteoblastogenesis. Emerging
genetic evidence in humans has linked various Wnt pathway members to body fat distribution, obesity, and
metabolic dysfunction, suggesting that this pathway is operative in terminally-differentiated adipocytes. Indeed,
recent studies in mice have uncovered compelling evidence suggesting that the Wnt pathway plays important
roles in adipocyte metabolism, particularly under obesogenic conditions. However, the exact functional roles of
the Wnt pathway and its underlying molecular mechanisms in this context remain unclear. In our initial
experiments to characterize the importance of this pathway in terminally-differentiated adipocytes, we deleted
Wntless, a dedicated intracellular chaperone for Wnt protein secretion, or β-catenin, the central signaling
molecule canonical Wnt pathway from cultured adipocytes and in adipose tissue. Both approaches revealed
that loss of adipocyte-derived Wnts or canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling in adipocytes coordinately down-
regulates lipogenic gene expression, resulting in impaired de novo lipogenesis and fatty acid
monounsaturation. Further, these effects on lipid metabolism are mediated by repression of Srebf1 and Mlxipl,
known master transcriptional regulators of lipogenic enzyme expression. In vivo, deletion of Wntless or β-
catenin does not influence global metabolism in mice maintained on chow diet. However, our studies revealed
a striking phenomenon by which adipose tissues are able to defend adipocyte-specific loss of Wntless or β-
catenin by compensatory up-regulation of Wnt signaling in surrounding stromal-vascular cells. Finally, long-
term overnutrition overrides this compensatory mechanism, such that both Wls-/- and β-cat-/- mice are resistant
to diet-induced obesity and protected from metabolic dysfunction. Herein we propose experiments to
investigate further the roles of Wnt signaling in adipose tissue. Specifically, we will investigate the mechanisms
by which Wnt/β-catenin regulates adipocyte gene expression and cell functions, and how intercellular Wnt
signaling monitors and compensates for the loss of Wnt signaling in adipocytes. Successful completion of
these aims will improve our understanding of how this ancient signaling pathway is critical for the physiology
and pathophysiology of adipose tissues."
10747944,"Gaining access to health data is the major barrier in developing and validating new AI methods for clinical
applications, since health data are protected by strict privacy laws. A significant obstacle in current data
provisioning is that existing methods to access and deidentifying health data are increasingly being
challenged for their effectiveness, with a common perception that it is generally impossible to fully
deidentify any health data set and still retain utility for research purposes.
 Synthetic data is a promising concept for solving this conundrum, by reconciling data innovation with
data privacy. The goal of synthetic data is to create an as-realistic-as-possible dataset generated from
existing data - one that maintains the statistical properties of the original dataset, but does so without risk
of exposing sensitive information. While synthetic data is not new in health care, so far it was limited to
simple, single-modality, static datasets, which severely affected its impact.
 The aim of this interdisciplinary research effort is the development of an algorithmic framework for the
faithful and privacy-preserving generation of heterogeneous, dynamic synthetic datasets to boost the
development of clinical decision support applications.
 In the US, critical illness effects a significant number of Americans per year with an estimated 4 million
admission and 500,000 deaths per year. A sizable proportion of the patients suffer respiratory failure
requiring intubation. To increase the utility of algorithms in clinical applications, like in the ICU, strategies
are needed to address barriers to use of complex data. Thus, the ICU is a prototypical setting where
high-quality synthetic data would be tremendously helpful to break through this data bottleneck, while
respecting health data privacy laws. However, ascertaining data to test and validate the algorithms is
difficult to obtain. As such, this project proposes to use a type of severe respiratory (lung) failure, acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to study the use of synthetic data for the development of artificial
intelligence-based algorithms. Patients with ARDS experience substantial morbidity and mortality,
prolonged mechanical ventilation high hospital-associated costs, and long-term physical and psychological
dysfunction. Using ARDS as an archetypical model to guide this research effort will a ensure successful
transition from theory to clinical practice.
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
The results of this project will play a key role in advancing AI research in health, especially in areas of
high-risk, high-cost care such as the emergency department, operating room, and ICU. On a specific level,
the project will improve detection and treatment of the acute respiratory distress syndrome. On a broader
level, this effort will contribute to more cost-efficient health care while enabling improved patient treatment
outcomes."

Endometriosis affects 6-11% of premenopausal women, causing pain, infertility, and
billions of dollars in U.S. health care related costs annually. With a poorly understood
etiology, endometriosis is characterized by hormonally responsive endometrial implants
outside the uterus. Evidence from experimental and human studies indicate that
endocrine disrupting chemicals, to which humans are nearly ubiquitously exposed, may
play a role in endometriosis etiology and severity. We propose to measure nine
perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and 53 persistent organic pollutants (POPs) to which
the population is broadly exposed, in eutopic (healthy uterine tissue) and ectopic
(endometriosis implants) endometrial tissue. The literature is limited in that there are no
studies of endometriosis incidence and severity in relation to PFASs, POPs, and their
mixtures measured in uterine tissue. This study leverages a unique biorepository
collected from the operative cohort of the Endometriosis: Natural History, Diagnosis,
and Outcomes (ENDO) Study, an NICHD study which enrolled 495 women aged 18-44
from 14 clinical centers in California and Utah prior to laparoscopic surgery. We will
determine: 1) whether higher levels of PFASs, POPs, and their mixtures in eutopic
endometrial tissue are associated with incident endometriosis and 2) how these
exposures in ectopic endometrial tissue are associated with endometriosis severity; 3)
whether mixtures of PFASs and POPs across serum, adipose tissue, and eutopic
endometrial tissue, are associated with endometriosis incidence; and finally, 4)
recognizing the infeasibility of most epidemiologic studies of gynecologic disease to
obtain endometrial tissue, we will develop a model to predict eutopic endometrial dose
from serum levels of PFAS and POP exposure. This study will provide critical data on
PFASs and POPs, which will advance scientific understanding and inform policy
makers."
10747855,"The assembly of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes is central to processes such as protein
translation, mRNA splicing, and telomere maintenance. ATPases of the DEAD-box family are
ubiquitous, highly conserved enzymes that play essential roles during RNP assembly in all
kingdoms of life. DEAD-box proteins play critical roles in human health and disease; defects in
DEAD-box proteins underlie the progression of specific cancers as well as developmental
disorders, and are co-opted by RNA viruses such as HIV and West Nile for viral RNA processing.
Though they are part of the SF2 family of helicases, DEAD-box proteins lack key domains
present in processive SF2 helicases, and rely instead on trans factors that regulate ATP
hydrolysis and substrate binding. During RNP assembly, ATPase activity has been proposed to
drive the remodeling of secondary and tertiary RNA structures, coordinating the ordered
addition of proteins to form functional RNP assemblies. The requirement of trans modulators
makes DEAD-box ATPases ideal regulators, integrating RNP biogenesis with cellular signaling.
However, due to the transient nature of their interactions, we have no molecular understanding
of the how DEAD-box proteins engage and remodel their RNP assembly substrates. This
proposal describes a hybrid approach to define the molecular details of four essential DEAD-box
proteins (Dbp10, Drs1, Spb4 and Mak5) during the assembly of a complex RNP, the large
ribosomal (60S) subunit. We genetically manipulated yeast strains to trap and enrich distinct,
transient DEAD-box·RNP intermediates. The structural characterization of these dynamic
complexes by cryo-electron microscopy, as part of an integrated approach that includes cross-
linking mass-spectrometry and targeted in vitro reconstitution experiments, will shed light on
the molecular interactions of DEAD-box proteins with substrate RNA and modulating co-
factors. Because DEAD-box modulation of 60S maturation is closely associated with the
regulation of nucleolar pre-60S release, we will use a color-switching yeast strain to probe the
effect the expression of Dbp10, Drs1, Mak5 and Spb4 trapping mutants have on the subcellular
distribution of 60s intermediates. Together, these studies represent a unique approach to
understand the function of DEAD-box proteins in the centrally important 60S biogenesis
pathway. These innovative reagents and their use within an integrative experimental
approach will uniquely inform how DEAD-box proteins engage transient, dynamic
intermediates to modulate RNP assembly."
10932961,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 This project seeks to investigate the intersection of a rare neurometabolic disorder, sepiapterin reductase
(SPR) deficiency, and a relatively rare childhood disorder, cerebral palsy (CP). Both present with motor deficits
and sometimes the clinical presentation can be similar. Mutations in the SPR gene result in deficiency of
tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). BH4 is not only a cofactor of five important enzymes in the brain, but is also involved
in the pathways of cell death, especially involving oxidants. Of the forms of non-apoptotic cell death, ferroptosis
is caused by a slew of oxidants along with the involvement of BH4. Given our past interest in oxidant effects
and that antioxidants reduce motor deficits, we propose to study ferroptosis in our rabbit model of CP. The
exact role of BH4 will be investigated by comparing the changes in ferroptosis pathways between a knock-in of
a human mutation in the rabbit and wild-type rabbits. Generating precise knock-in rabbits representing patient
mutations has not been possible until recently, achieved by our multi-principal-investigator team. The knock-in
of the human R150G mutation was done through the clustered-regularly-interspaced-short-palindromic-repeats
(CRISPR) gene editing platform. The rabbit model of CP utilizes hypoxia-ischemia (H-I) akin to human acute
placental insufficiency at preterm gestation, based on the human abruptio placentae. This fetal H-I model is the
first to reliably lead to CP, allowing us to rigorously test not only mechanistic pathways but also possible
therapies for motor deficits, for which there is none currently available. With the development of a surrogate
marker of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we can predict which fetuses will develop postnatal motor
deficits. This advance allows the early identification of critical pathways causing hypertonia, making an in-depth
study of ferroptosis possible, as ferroptosis occurs early after the fetal insult. Our hypothesis is that cell death
by specific pathways of oxidant stress related to BH4 determines the development of later CP motor deficits
The first Aim will determine whether knock-in of the human mutation R150G in rabbits increases susceptibility
to motor deficits. The second Aim will determine whether specific oxidants related to BH4 determine critical
ferroptosis that leads to motor deficits. The underlying biochemical mechanisms will be studied utilizing the
identification of fetuses destined to get postnatal hypertonia and studying entire brain, brain regions and cell
suspensions. Innovations proposed are the systemic integration of MRI as a surrogate marker with flow
cytometry techniques, fluorescent and electron microscopy, automated western blot, electron paramagnetic
spectroscopy, high performance liquid chromatography, and mass spectrometry into the unique animal model
to probe the biochemical basis of ferroptosis, with testing of possible future therapies. These studies will
elucidate the early events around critical cell death that cause motor deficits. The clinical importance is that the
proposed studies provide the mechanistic understanding for the systematic development of much-needed
therapies for prevention of motor deficits from congenital BH4 deficiency and CP."

Poxviruses include family members that are categorized as Class A Priority Pathogens with significant future
pandemic potential, while modified forms of other family members are widely used as vaccine vectors and
oncolytic therapeutics. Beyond their more direct medical significance, poxviruses also have a long history as
invaluable research tools at the forefront in the discovery of fundamental cellular processes. These include the
discovery of 5’ 7-Methyl GTP capping, 2’-O-Methylation and 3’ polyadenylation that we now know to occur on
almost all eukaryotic as well as viral mRNAs. This is in part because poxviruses encode their own fully
functional DNA replication, transcription and mRNA biogenesis machinery, which enables these remarkably
self-sufficient DNA viruses to replicate in the cytoplasm. Despite this, like all other viruses, poxviruses remain
entirely dependent on gaining access to host ribosomes to synthesize viral proteins and replicate. While the
mechanisms by which both viruses and their host cells control translation through the activity of eukaryotic
initiation factors (eIFs) are well understood, until recently ribosomes were largely viewed as passive code-
reading machines that lacked intrinsic regulatory capacity. In the prior award, we revealed that the poxvirus
kinase, B1 phosphorylates a number of ribosomal subunit proteins (RPs) at Serine and Threonine residues
that are not modified in uninfected cells or cells infected with other viruses. These include phosphorylation of
S278 in a loop domain of the small 40S RP, Receptor for Activated C Kinase 1 (RACK1) that serves to
enhance translation of viral mRNAs that harbor unusual 5’ polyA-leaders. Such leaders are normally selected
against in their mammalian hosts where adenosine homopolymers are restricted to the 3’ untranslated polyA-
tail, but B1-mediated phosphorylation effectively mimics negatively charged amino acids that are found in the
RACK1 loop of dicot plants and protists whose translation systems naturally accommodate 5’ polyA. Beyond
insights into viral manipulation of ribosomes, these findings provided one of the first examples of ribosomal
post-translational modifications that can regulate translation directly as well as unexpected insights into the
structural and functional diversification of ribosomes across different species. Beyond RACK1, which lies at the
mRNA exit channel, we also identified additional poxvirus-specific phosphorylation events in other small RPs,
including RPS28 that lies at the mRNA entry channel. Biochemical and structure modeling lead us to
hypothesize that these modified RPs form an interconnected network whose phosphorylation enables
poxviruses to remodel the mRNA channel of the ribosome to better accommodate 5’ polyA-leaders in their
mammalian hosts. Preliminary cryo electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and functional studies using a newly
developed cell system reconstituted with phosphomimetics of poxvirus-modified RPs further supports this
hypothesis and suggests an unprecedented level of ribosome remodeling or “species repurposing” arises from
these phosphorylation events, which this renewal application proposes to study in fine mechanistic detail."

Project Summary
Timely recognition and forecasting of cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) in hospitalized patients in step-down
units (SDU) has clear implications for strategies to reduce preventable morbidity and mortality. Continuous
noninvasive vital signs (VS) monitoring is widely used to facilitate nurse detection of actionable events
requiring a diagnostic or therapeutic response, yet failure-to-rescue rates in US hospitals, defined as death due
to complications, remain high. Traditional VS monitoring alarms are largely based on numeric threshold
exceedance, translating to very low true positive rates and adversely leading to alarm fatigue and reactive
nursing care. We and others have demonstrated that decompensation evolves over time and featurization,
trending, and phenotyping of multi-channel VS time series for building relevant models for forecasting CRI is
feasible. Over the past two funding periods, we have built the largest multi-site database of EHR-linked, high
fidelity VS monitoring data from SDU patients known to us. Using this multi-expert, multi-tier ground truth
annotated database we have begun to build clinically relevant Machine Learning models to discriminate
artifactual anomaly from real CRI with high accuracy, as well as to classify mild vs. serious CRI and forecast
cases that require escalation of care or up transfer to intensive care. We now aim to move these extensive
efforts to fruition and refine and build these models in the workflow for prospective validation and clinical
deployment. The specific aims of this renewal application are: 1) build and deploy a real-time data streaming
architecture at bedside for an intelligent alerting system, including the iterative design and usability testing of a
clinician-facing graphical user interface; 2) build and externally validate a multi-layered alerting system
forecasting CRI; and 3) perform a prospective validation of the intelligent alerting system, including silent
deployment and evaluation at SDUs at UPITT and UCSF followed by prospective field testing at a 16-bed SDU
at UPITT. The final deliverable is an intelligent alerting system for detection and mitigation of CRI in SDU
patients of sufficient readiness to be deployed in a multicenter human effectiveness trial as a next step.
Building such a clinically relevant system in clinical workflow to predict patient instability has important
implications for reducing preventable morbidity and mortality, eliminating alarm fatigue, improving patient
safety, nursing care logistics (monitoring frequency, case load and mixture, staff allocation) and care delivery
systems (triage, bed allocation, prevention of adverse events)."

commencing L-DOPA, nearly 90% of PD patients develop intractable abnormal involuntary movements known as L-
DOPA-induced dyskinesias (LID), severely impacting quality of life. Research implicates serotonin (5-HT) neurons
as a source of LID as they can take up L-DOPA, convert it to dopamine (DA), and release DA as an unregulated
“false neurotransmitter” leading to a dyskinesogenic phenotype. Although treatments aimed at alleviating LID have
emerged, only a minority of patients benefit due to their cost, side effects and/or invasiveness. Moreover, we
have yet to find a way to prevent LID development, in part due to major gaps in knowledge on how L-DOPA
treatment instigates maladaptive 5-HT reorganization and aberrant striatal output. Our research team has
recently collected preliminary data using novel approaches that provide exciting new insights into the
mechanisms of 5-HT neuroplasticity that will enlighten both basic and clinical science. These convergent findings
led us to postulate our Central Hypothesis that maladaptive 5-HT-raphe-striatal neurocircuit plasticity
precipitates and maintains LID. The overarching goal for our multi-investigator team is to identify the mechanisms
underlying the development of structural and functional maladaptation within the raphe-striatal circuit driving LID,
which in turn could lead to novel, optimized targets for intervention. We will fill this knowledge gap through the
pursuit of 3 independent, but inter-related Specific Aims. Our 3 Specific Aims will: 1) define the extent to which
DA denervation and/or L-DOPA treatment results in anatomical and functional reorganization of the 5-HT raphe-
striatal pathway in PD and experimental parkinsonism, 2) use projection-specific chemogenetic modulations to
determine the impact of the 5-HT raphe-striatal activity on L-DOPA-induced anti-parkinsonian efficacy and
dyskinesia, and 3) establish how regulating DA release from 5-HT raphe-striatal neurons prevents the
development of LID and associated maladaptive neuronal changes. The proposed cross-species investigation will
establish neuroplasticity within the 5-HT raphe-striatal circuit as a foremost factor in the development and expression
of LID and in so doing, identify optimal treatment strategies to improve the quality of life for millions of current and
prospective PD patients."

Exposure of the developing brain to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and disruption of the gut microbiome
have independently been implicated in the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Both phenomena
likely interact by two mechanisms to cause adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes: PCB-mediated changes in
the gut microbiome (1) alter the profile of neuroactive microbial metabolites distributed to the developing brain and
(2) affect PCB disposition in the developing brain by modifying host and microbial PCB metabolism. A mechanistic
understanding of these interactions is required to address the critical need for interventional strategies that effec-
tively reduce the impact of PCB-induced NDDs on individuals, families, and society. The long-term goal is to de-
termine the role of the gut microbiome–liver–brain axis in modulating susceptibility to PCB effects on the develop-
ing brain, with the objective of characterizing how dose-dependent interactions between maternal exposure to an
environmentally relevant PCB mixture and the gut microbiome influence neurotoxic outcomes in conventional
(CV) vs. germ-free (GF) juvenile mice. We will test the central hypothesis that dysbiosis of the gut microbiome as-
sociated with developmental exposure to varying doses of PCBs contributes to adverse neurodevelopmental out-
comes later in life. This hypothesis is based on preliminary studies showing that: (1) PCB exposure causes
dysbiosis of the gut microbiome; (2) PCBs and their metabolites are present in the rodent brain; (3) the expression
of PCB-metabolizing enzymes differs between CV vs. GF mice; (4) PCB disposition differs between CV and GF
mice; and (5) PCBs are developmental neurotoxicants in mice. Guided by these preliminary data, the novel hy-
pothesis will be tested by (a) characterizing gut microbiome composition and function and neuroactive microbial
metabolites; (b) determining how differences in host vs. microbial biotransformation affect disposition of PCBs and
their metabolites; and (c) examining neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, synaptic connectivity, and behavior in
dams and fetuses/pups derived from (i) CV vs.GF dams exposed to PCBs in the diet and (ii) GF dams who re-
ceived a fecal transplant from PCB-exposed or vehicle control CV dams. The proposed research is innovative
because it uses a systems biology approach in a state-of-the-art mouse model to assess the role of the gut mi-
crobiome–liver–brain axis in modulating neurotoxic outcomes following exposure to an environmental PCB mix-
ture. The anticipated outcome of these studies is a new research paradigm demonstrating that developmental
exposures to PCBs mediate (1) longitudinal changes in gut microbiome composition and function and (2) alter
PCB disposition in the developing brain that influence neurodevelopmental outcomes later in life. This outcome
will have a significant impact on public health by informing future studies of cellular mechanisms of the devel-
opmental origin of PCB neurotoxicity and, ultimately, provide critical insights regarding the plausibility of micro-
biome-based approaches to diagnose and treat NDDs induced by exposure to neurotoxicants."

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppresses HIV replication and allows a normal lifespan for infected persons, but
daily pill ingestion is required to avoid progression to AIDS and further HIV transmission. Multiple therapeutic
strategies are being considered to achieve a functional cure for HIV. However, to date, no single approach has
achieved sufficient potency for an HIV functional cure. Therefore, there is increasing agreement that an HIV cure
will require a multi-pronged approach. This proposal has the objective to identify optimal and feasible
combinations of investigational therapeutic approaches to achieve functional cure of HIV using data-validated
mathematical models. Our hypothesis is that data-validated mathematical models can identify specific
mechanisms of therapeutic combinations, by linking observed kinetics and potency with various quantifiable
outcome measures. Our specific aims will validate this hypothesis by fitting different mathematical models that
encapsulate competing possible mechanisms to outcome data from curative interventions currently under study,
including levels of different reservoir cellular subset, viral quantities, viral diversity and time to viral rebound.
Model selection theory will be used to identify the most parsimonious models that reliably explain experimental
results. We will use the most parsimonious model that recapitulated the data from each study to perform in silico
experiments. We will list all plausible combinations of therapeutic approaches and model each combination. We
will create combinatorial dose-response curves by running simulations for each combination by using the
parameterization obtained from the fits and by tuning the parameters for each therapy including dosing,
scheduling, and order of treatment. This proposal is significant because testing all possible combinations of
approaches is impractical, excessively time consuming and expensive. The inability to rigorously assess all
potential approaches is a critical barrier to achieve optimal outcomes. Therefore, our proposal is innovative
because we propose a rigorous, quantitative framework in which plausible combinations of available
interventions are considered and compared with the potential to identify which combination therapies most likely
will achieve a functional cure."

10912500,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over 40% of adult women in the U.S. are obese and obesity will soon overtake smoking as the leading risk factor
for cancer. For breast cancer, obese women demonstrate both a higher incidence and higher rate of cancer-
related mortality compared to normal weight women. While many studies focus on potential systemic
connections behind this observation, the breast is rich in white adipose tissue (WAT), which is highly remodeled
in the context of obesity, and thus local tissue-resident cues must also be considered. At the cellular level, white
adipocytes are the functional units of WAT and secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) that promote tumor
progression. Recent studies indicate that adipocyte-derived EVs contain lipids and other metabolites for fatty
acid oxidation that modulate tumor cell metabolism to increase migration, proliferation, and chemoresistance. In
obese individuals, adipocytes become hypertrophic with known consequences for metabolic disease. Whether
adipocyte hypertrophy similarly impacts breast cancer risk and prognosis is less clear. Preliminary data in this
proposal indicate that hypertrophic adipocytes promote the proliferation and migration of co-cultured tumor cells
to a greater extent than donor-matched, non-hypertrophic control adipocytes. Moreover, I found that hypertrophic
adipocytes secrete more EVs and exhibit remodeled cortical actin. Given that the actin cytoskeleton mediates
the biogenesis of EVs by other cell types, this proposal aims to investigate if hypertrophy, remodeled cortical
actin, and increased EV secretion are interconnected. Moreover, the proposed research also aims to discern if
these differences impact breast cancer progression by altering tumor cell metabolism. In Specific Aim 1, I will
characterize the concentration, size distribution, and cargo of EVs released by hypertrophic vs. control
adipocytes via nanoparticle tracking analysis and mass spectrometry. In Specific Aim 2, I will expose breast
cancer cells to EVs secreted by hypertrophic vs. control adipocytes to assess how treatment impacts tumor cell
behavior in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, I will perform pharmacological and genetic inhibitor studies to determine
if altered fatty acid oxidation underpins any observed differences in tumor cell phenotypes. Collectively, this work
will help discern if hypertrophic adipocytes constitute a distinct subpopulation of cells conducive to tumor
progression and thus contribute to the poor prognosis of obesity-associated breast cancer. In the clinic, identified
molecular mechanisms between adipocytes and tumor cells could be targeted therapeutically and the degree of
mammary adipocyte hypertrophy could serve as a prognostic biomarker for patient outcomes. Beyond research,
I will develop skills around experimental design, data analysis, mentorship, and science communication through
my training goals and team of mentors outlined in this proposal. These skills will be essential to achieve my long-
term professional goal of becoming an independent investigator at a research-focused institution."

The goal of this Ruth L. Kirschstein NRSA F31 fellowship is to develop the expertise of the applicant in
pathogenic mechanisms of alcohol-induced post-translational modifications (PTMs). Alcohol-associated liver
disease (ALD) is a leading cause of preventable mortality worldwide causing approximately 5.9% of deaths every
year, yet lacks preventative or regenerative therapies. The liver is the primary site of alcohol detoxification
generating products that negatively impact hepatic biochemistry. A major consequence of alcohol metabolism is
the induction of lysine acetylation, a metabolically induced PTM. One poorly characterized factor is the disruption
to the network of cysteine thiols involved in the cysteine proteome, which is crucial to enzyme activity, protein
structure, and signaling. Models of early-stage ALD have been applied to proteomic studies to better understand
the downstream effects of alcohol metabolism and elucidate perturbed pathways. Using a 6-week Lieber-DeCarli
(LD) model, we quantified thiol redox changes in the hepatic proteome employing a novel click-chemistry-based
nHPLC-MS/MS assay. With the same model, we examined the impact of chronic alcohol consumption on hepatic
lysine N-acetylation through quantitative analysis via acetyl-IP followed by nHPLC-MS/MS. Briefly, these studies
identified that alcohol feeding induced an overall reduced cysteine proteome and increased lysine acetylation.
Recent studies have identified a biophysical spatial association between lysine and cysteine amino acids leading
to direct interactions. Lysine acetylation is amplified when cysteine residues are within 15 Å, referred to as a
cysteine-lysine pair (CysLys). Our work suggests the alcohol-induced increase in N-acetylation is partially due
to the acetylation of the more reactive cysteine thiol followed by transfer to a nearby lysine, resulting in an SàN
acetyl transfer reaction. The proposed training plan will investigate this relationship in a chronic LD model by
integrating acetyl- and thiol redox OMIC analyses to evaluate pathologically relevant protein targets. Therefore,
the central hypothesis of this F31 application is that protein CysLys pairs are a mechanism for increased lysine
acetylation and cysteine redox sensitivity during alcohol toxicity and contributes to the pathology of ALD. Specific
aim 1 will characterize hepatic proteomic signatures impacted by Lys acetylation and Cys redox changes due to
chronic alcohol metabolism using a multi-layered integrated analysis. Specific aim 2 will define regulatory
mechanisms of SàN acetyl transfer in specific proteins critical to the progression of ALD. These aims will be
interrogated utilizing a multidisciplinary approach that will provide a thorough understanding of lysine acetylation
and thiol redox signaling by regulating protein structure. Completion of these specific aims will support the
applicant in becoming an independent researcher in the field of alcohol-induced metabolic dysregulation."
10898637,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Although heart disease is the number one cause of death among women, prevention efforts in women have
lagged. Additionally, in most studies to date, research on heart disease has focused on older women, but there
is a growing burden of myocardial infarction among women under 60 years of age. Recent studies point to
stress as playing a more important role in the manifestation of cardiovascular disease risk factors in younger
women compared to younger men. Women experience increased emotional and physical symptoms as a
result of stress. Psychological stress and autonomic physiological (i.e., heart rate variability) are associated
with physical inactivity. Physical inactivity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and death.
Therefore, more research is needed to investigate the role of physical inactivity as a unique risk factor for
cardiovascular diseases amongst young women. We will leverage data from the NHLBI-funded study: Mental
Stress and Myocardial Ischemia After MI: Sex Differences, Mechanisms and Prognosis (MIMS3) (2 R01
HL109413) in order to investigate the role of stress and physical activity in a group of post-MI women and men.
In AIM 1, we will compare physical activity levels between young post-MI women and men. In AIM 2, we will
investigate whether daily reports of psychological stress are temporally associated with physical activity levels
in post-MI individuals and examine for interaction by sex. And in AIM 3, we will examine whether autonomic
physiology (i.e., heart rate variability) is temporally associated with physical activity levels in post-MI individuals
and examine for interaction by sex. We hypothesize that there will be differences in physical activity between
women and men who are post-MI. We also hypothesize that there will be a bi-directional, temporal relationship
between both physiological and autonomic physiology and physical activity. This research project will be
important in generating the impetus for future studies regarding risk factors for cardiovascular diseases in
young, post-MI individuals, especially with regards to stress reduction as a lever for increasing physical activity.
We hope that this research aids in decisions made by public health practitioners, clinicians, and policy-makers
in the design of interventions for post-MI populations that could help narrow the gap in and reduce the risk
factors for negative cardiovascular outcomes by sex."

The goal of this proposal is to advance as a surgeon-scientist to become an independent investigator through
completion of the proposed research project and career development under the oversight of an outstanding
mentoring team of gastrointestinal and FXR signaling experts. The career development described will provide
foundational insight as I design experimental approaches and assess study outcomes. This award will also
support the protected time needed to establish a strong publication record in the field of intestinal physiology
and develop preliminary data for a competitive R level submission.
The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a key bile acid receptor that influences the intestinal epithelial barrier. While
activation of FXR seems to be beneficial in chronic injury models of the intestine, our preliminary data show
that in acute, inflammatory injury, FXR activation is deleterious. FXR knock-out (KO) animals, in contrast, are
protected from acute injury. In this proposal, we will define the role of FXR in intestinal barrier function during
acute injury. We hypothesize that FXR activation compromises intestinal barrier function by upregulating small
heterodimer protein (SHP), while interfering with EGFR signaling, leading to tight junction disruption. We will
test this hypothesis with the following specific aims: 1) Determine the mechanisms involved in FXR regulating
intestinal epithelial barrier function, and 2) Test the effect of tissue-specific FXR inhibition on the intestinal bar-
rier using acute injury models in vivo.
We will determine the role of FXR and its downstream effector SHP in intestinal barrier function in vitro and in
vivo. To explore this, we will use enteroid-derived monolayers from wild type, FXR KO, SHO KO, and EGFR
dominant-negative ‘Velvet’ mice to determine the effects on the intestinal barrier and tight junctional proteins
with and without injury. We will determine FXR and EGFR signal activation using qPCR and Western blot anal-
yses. We will determine the role of macrophages using bone marrow-derived culture from genetically-modified
animals. These in vitro findings will be tested in vivo using an LPS-injection model of acute injury, utilizing FXR
(whole body, intestinal-specific, and macrophage-specific) and SHP KO mice. Cecal ligation and puncture will
be used to test pharmacologic manipulation of the FXR pathway on disease progression.
This project will begin to establish the role of FXR regulation of the intestinal epithelial barrier in the setting of
acute injury. Long term, these findings will provide needed insight into the development of preventative and
therapeutic strategies in gut origin sepsis, inflammatory bowel disease, or other GI pathologies. This research
has the potential to improve the outcomes of patients with diseases that affect intestinal integrity through better
understanding of the mechanisms of FXR-mediated intestinal barrier function."
10754269,"Unlike sight, taste and smell, mechanical senses extend beyond a single sensory organ, and encompass processes as diverse as hearing, somatosensation, and interoception. Despite their physiological importance, the molecular identity of mechanotransduction channels is largely unknown. Our lab discovered the first vertebrate mechanically-gated cation channels, Piezo1 and Piezo2, and have shown that Piezo2 plays a critical role in detecting touch, proprioception and lung stretch, but not noxious mechanical stimuli. However, big questions remain: what other mechanosensory systems depend on Piezos, and what is the identity of the remaining noxious mechanosensors? We will explore the role of Piezo2 in various forms of internal-organ mechanotransduction (interoception), including satiety and baroreception - processes crucial for normal physiology and pathophysiology. Beyond Piezo2, unknown mechanosensors mediate the transduction of noxious mechanical forces leading to the perception of pain, and are anticipated to be important therapeutic targets. We will use high-throughput screens and functional genomics approaches to find these receptors. Identifying these elusive sensors will break open the pain field, as Piezo2 has done for touch."
10997313,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Oligodendrocytes are glial cells in the central nervous system that form myelin, which are critical for the proper
formation and function of neural circuits. During brain development, neural progenitor cells first give rise to
excitatory neurons before gradually transitioning to the production of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs); a
phenomenon known as the “neuron-glia switch”. Whereas oligodendrocyte differentiation from OPCs and myelin
formation are well understood, we still do not know the earlier mechanisms that facilitate the neuron-glia switch
and specify progenitors towards an OPC fate. This study aims to understand the developmental and molecular
mechanisms that instruct neural progenitors to generate OPCs instead of neurons in the developing mouse
neocortex. Our lab previously identified Sonic hedgehog (Shh) as a critical extracellular signal that initiates the
neuron-glia switch during late embryonic development. However, while some progenitors generate OPCs in
response to Shh, others continue to produce neurons. This suggests that co-existing neural progenitors
differentially respond to Shh and require additional cell-intrinsic mechanisms to acquire an OPC fate. Our single
cell RNA-sequencing analysis and my preliminary data indicate that both the Notch signaling pathway and the
transcription factor Ascl1 are critical for promoting OPC specification from neural progenitors in response to Shh.
Importantly, Ascl1 has recently been identified as a pioneer transcription factor capable of promoting chromatin
accessibility to direct cell fates. Based on these data, I hypothesize that the Notch signaling pathway promotes
OPC specification by regulating the response of neural progenitors to Shh in addition to establishing an
epigenetic state primed for the OPC fate through Ascl1. I will test this hypothesis in two Specific Aims: 1) Define
the functional role of Notch signaling in Shh-mediated OPC specification using in vivo genetic manipulations and
ex vivo pharmacological approaches and 2) Test the hypothesis that Notch signaling cooperates with Ascl1 to
promote an epigenetic state for specifying the oligodendrocyte lineage. Completion of these aims will significantly
contribute to a better understanding of neural cell fate specification and oligodendrocyte development, which will
allow for novel tools and methods to restore myelin following disease and injury."

Neurological diseases and psychiatric disorders account for ~28% of the global burden of disease. Our ability to
prevent and treat these diseases and disorders is hindered by their complex, multifactorial etiologies. Our long-
term goal is to help prevent neurological diseases and psychiatric disorders by using functional neuroimaging
studies in zebrafish to understand the susceptibility of neural populations to toxicant exposures during critical
periods of development. Disruptions in the balance of excitatory and inhibitory signaling contribute to a number
of neurological diseases and psychiatric disorders including hyperactivity, autism, intellectual disabilities,
schizophrenia, epilepsy, and Alzheimer’s Disease. A common theme connecting these diverse diseases and
disorders is the disrupted development of parvalbumin (PV) interneurons. Our immediate goal is to gain insight
into the molecular mechanisms mediating PV development and function and how these critical developmental
processes are disrupted by toxicant exposure. To achieve this goal, we are developing a suite of genetic tools
for visualizing the development, connectivity, and functioning of PV interneurons in vivo as well as tools for
manipulating gene function specifically in PV interneurons. In addition, we are generating transgenic lines that
allow us to visualize the assembly and functioning of excitatory circuitry in the context of our PV interneuron-
specific manipulations. Our preliminary data indicate that dlx1, 5 and 6, known regulators of GABAergic and PV
interneuron development, and multiple isoforms of PV, are downregulated following exposure to 2,3,7,8-
Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (dioxin, TCDD), a prototypical aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) agonist. In Aim 1,
we will utilize our genetic tool kit and functional neuroimaging to determine if exposure to different AHR agonists
disrupts PV interneuron development and function. We will use cell-type specific genetic manipulations to
activate AHR in PV interneurons and determine if AHR activation alters PV interneuron function, the assembly
of excitatory circuits in the developing brain, and is sufficient to produce larval hyperactivity as well as deficits in
adult learning and memory. Mammalian Sox9 and zebrafish sox9b are AHR targets and are also downregulated
following exposure to a number of toxicants including mono-butyl phthalate, 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether
sulfonate, valproic acid, and chlorpyrifos. Mammalian Sox9 marks radial progenitor cells (RGP), an important
source of GABAergic interneurons. In Aim 2, we will determine whether zebrafish sox9b is an important
transcriptional regulator of PV development, and if PV-interneuron specific loss of sox9b is sufficient to disrupt
PV interneuron function and larval and adult behavior. In Aim 3, we will use photoconvertible indicators of neural
activity to determine the differential effects of AHR agonist exposure on embryonic and larval brain function.
Together, these studies will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms mediating PV interneuron
development and toxicant-induced disruption of this critical cell-type. The proposed studies directly contribute to
NIEHS’s Strategic Goal 1, parts c, d, & e."
10745910,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 SETD2 is mutationally inactivated in many cancer types including lung adenocarcinoma. In published
work, we demonstrated that Setd2 inactivation has potent tumor promoting effects in an autochthonous mouse
model of KRASG12D-driven lung adenocarcinoma. SETD2 uniquely catalyzes histone H3 lysine 36
trimethylation (H3K36me3), which marks actively transcribed gene bodies, facilitating chromatin resetting after
gene transcription. In the current project, we aim to understand the provocative observation that SETD2
inactivation potently drives tumor cell proliferation due to a defect in one-carbon metabolism and activation of
mTORC1 signaling. We demonstrate that SETD2 loss is associated with an enrichment in the abundance of S-
adenosyl methionine (SAM) and multiple other metabolites that are part of SAM-adjacent metabolic pathways.
We will test the hypothesis that the disuse of SAM that results from the lost activity of the SETD2
methyltransferase leads to SAM accumulation, enhanced one-carbon metabolism, and activation of mTORC1
signaling, all supporting cell growth and proliferation. Consistent with this hypothesis, we demonstrate that
limiting dietary intake of methionine reduces KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma growth and reverses the
effects of SETD2 inactivation. Thus, we will assess the efficacy of clinical and pre-clinical drugs that target the
methionine cycle for potential synthetic lethal interactions with SETD2 deficiency. Finally, downstream of
activated mTORC1 signaling we observe prominent transcriptional programs of hypoxia inducible factors
(HIFs) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) coactivator 1 α (PGC1α). Consistently, we
observe multiple pathophysiological changes that are associated with increased activation of HIF and PGC1α
transcription, such as alterations in mitochondrial biogenesis and the co-enhancement of oxidative
phosphorylation and glycolytic pathways. Thus, we will test the requirement of these master transcription
factors for effectuating phenotypes downstream of SETD2 inactivation."
10745913,"Project Summary/Abstract: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, with an estimated 246,660
cases (and 40,450 deaths) in the US during 2015. Due to better screening techniques cancers are caught earlier
and 75% of patients are candidates for breast conserving surgery (BCS) to remove the cancer. BCS is
cosmetically preferable to the alternative (mastectomy) and long-term survival rates are equivalent [1]. The
success of BCS is assessed post-operatively by pathology. The status of the microscopic margins of excision of
the lumpectomy specimen is still the most important prognostic and risk factor for local recurrence [2,3]. A
positive margin indicates that invasive carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ is touching a tissue edge of a
lumpectomy specimen. Among patients treated by BCS and radiation therapy, positive margins are associated
with a 2-fold increase in the risk of local recurrence when compared with negative margins [4]. A finding of
positive margins is estimated to occur between 8% to 86% of the time, requiring patients to return for further
treatment often associated with poorer cosmetic results and increases in local and distant recurrence of the
disease. Current pathology methods only assess about 1/10 of 1% of the entire volume of the removed specimen.
A consequence of margin undersampling is that local recurrence occurs in 5-16% of patients with pathologically
clean margins, suggesting that one or more regions of tumor had not been sampled during pathological analysis
resulting in tumor remaining in the patient. In addition, there is still no universal agreement among breast
surgeons on what constitutes an adequate negative margin for patients undergoing BCS [5]. Together these
data demonstrate the unmet clinical need for technologies that rapidly and globally identify cancerous tissues in
the surgical cavity and can be used to guide their surgical resections during the procedure. Molecular imaging
guided resections of tumors during surgeries are now being developed. However, most approaches employ IV
administration of optical imaging agents, which require hours or days to highlight tumor tissues. Moreover,
infiltrating cancer cells in tissues surrounding the main mass may not have developed a vasculature and likely
would not be identified using injected agents. Finally, illuminating the entire cancer mass may create a high
background signal from tumor that is not “at the margin” of the lumpectomy. Exploiting increased protease
expression at the edge of breast cancers we introduce the novel concept of in vivo topical administration of
quenched fluorescent molecular imaging probes to identify cancer that may remain in the surgical cavity after
standard-of-care resection. This builds on years of preclinical studies and seeks to characterize, perform
toxicology, and finally a Phase 1A & B clinical trial to demonstrate the utility of this novel approach. It has the
potential to reduce re-excisions as well as the false negative rate from pathology undersampling, with a
consequent savings in healthcare costs and, enhancement in patient life quality."

Granulomas are hallmark pathological features of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and contribute to both
containment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection and progression to TB disease. However, we do not
understand how the geospatial organization of immune cells and their communication networks impact the host
immune functions that render a granuloma functionally permissive versus restrictive to Mtb. Stresses
encountered by Mtb during infection induce bacterial adaptations that promote Mtb survival and drug tolerance,
but we know little about the bacterial growth and metabolic changes induced within different granuloma
microenvironments during disease or treatment and how the geospatial organization and immune state of the
granuloma impacts bacterial physiology and killing. To understand how cellular networks and granuloma spatial
architecture determine the functional capacities of major granuloma types, we propose to develop a TB
Granuloma Information System (TB-GIS) that will generate a geospatial map for individual granulomas and layer
on additional data related to immunometabolic and antimicrobial functions, as well as Mtb physiology and
adaptation. To characterize granuloma topology, we have exploited and optimized a novel high-plex imaging
modality, t-CyCIF (tissue Cyclic Immunofluorescence), which allows for deep geospatial immune profiling of
tissue (30+ markers). We will leverage our well-established nonhuman primate (NHP) model of aerogenic Mtb
infection which recapitulates the spectrum of human lung pathological lesions and integrate additional cutting-
edge tools and computational modeling to probe the host-pathogen interface in different TB granulomas (Aim 1).
We will also determine how perturbing granuloma topology with host- or pathogen-directed therapies impacts
immune function and Mtb metabolic state (Aim 2). Using the TB-GIS framework, we will quantify the relationship
between specific granuloma features and cellular networks, immune function and Mtb physiology in treated and
untreated animals. We anticipate that these TB-GIS studies will transform our ability to predict granuloma
function and help design new therapies to target granulomas harboring drug-tolerant bacteria that are difficult to
clear with current treatment regimens."

function and help design new therapies to target granulomas harboring drug-tolerant bacteria that are difficult to
clear with current treatment regimens."
10900632,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Falling and fear of falling are pervasive amongst individuals with lower limb amputation (LLA), a large and
growing population in the nation. The incidence of falls in individuals with LLA has been often reported during
activities requiring adjustments in posture. Transfers (e.g., sit-to-stand) and activities involving dynamic balance
control (e.g., reaching and turning) lead to many of the falls in dysvascular transtibial amputees. This evidence
highlights the urgent need to address balance and postural stability to enable effective activities of daily living for
individuals with LLA.
Current prosthesis technology does not allow the amputee users to apply typical postural control strategies at
prosthetic joints, limiting postural stability and yielding additional health concerns. Instead, amputees often
develop compensatory strategies with the residual (unamputated) joints and intact limb to control balance. The
loss of active degrees of freedom (e.g., ankle and/or knee) in the lower limb significantly limits the biomechanical
resources available for postural control.
Recent advancements in prosthesis and neural interfacing technologies potentially can address the need for
improved balance and postural stability in individuals with LLA; however, the related research emphasizes
efficient and comfortable walking, rather than balance and postural control. As balance and postural control
underly almost all activities performed in an upright position, using prosthesis technologies to directly address
the balance stability of amputees is highly needed but rarely investigated in our field.
The objective of this proposal is to investigate the effects of training to use direct electromyographic (dEMG)
control of a powered prosthetic ankle on transtibial amputees’ (Aim 1) balance and postural stability, (Aim 2)
neuromuscular control and coordination, and (Aim 3) cognitive processes, compared to daily prescribed passive
devices.
This project has clear clinical significance since it addresses the clinical need for improved balance and postural
stability in individuals with LLA. Use of dEMG-controlled powered prostheses provides users with additional
resources to assist with balance stability and improve balance confidence, which, in turn, improves their
community participation and quality of life. At the same time, the proposed project is expected to contribute
important knowledge to the field of prosthesis technology, make scientific contributions to the fields of motor
control and learning, biomechanics, and cognitive-motor interaction, and benefit physical therapy and amputee
rehabilitation."

 This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Stanley Vance, Jr., MD, whose research focuses on
barriers to gender-affirming care for transgender youth. His research training includes an Adolescent Medicine
fellowship and formal course work in quantitative approaches. Through activities proposed in this application,
Dr. Vance will build skills in qualitative methodology, youth/caregiver-facing intervention development, and
randomized controlled trials. The resources to foster his career development include UCSF’s Adolescent and
Young Adult Medicine Division, Child and Adolescent Gender Center, Center for AIDS Prevention Studies, K-
Scholars Program, and graduate coursework in qualitative methods and intervention development and trials.
He has convened a mentoring team experienced in relevant disciplines of community-based research with
transgender populations, pediatric transgender research, qualitative methods, and intervention implementation
to guide the completion of his research and career development into an independent researcher.
 Informed by the Gender Affirmation and Intersectional Stigma models, this proposal focuses on Black
and Latinx transgender youth (BLTY). BLTY face intersecting forces of racism and transphobia, thereby
increasing their vulnerability to poor mental health outcomes. However, there is a paucity of data that
document the cultural and familial factors that may contribute to these mental health disparities. Although
gender affirmation—receiving social support for one’s gender identity and/or medical treatment to affirm one’s
gender—improves mental health for transgender youth, cultural and parental influences on gender affirmation
for BLTY have not been delineated. Exploring such factors could provide critical information to supporting
BLTY and their caregivers through interventions. This career development award seeks to address these gaps
in the literature through the following specific aims which will be carried out with guidance from a Community
Advisory Board: Aim 1: To gather qualitative data to inform the development of a culturally informed
intervention to improve mental health outcomes among BLTY. This includes conducting in-depth interviews
with Black and Latinx transgender young adults about their prior experiences with gender affirmation and how
their caregivers and cultures influenced such experiences. This aim also includes focus groups with Black and
Latinx caregivers to understand cultural views of gender diversity. Aim 2: To develop a culturally informed
intervention that promotes gender affirmation and mental health of BLTY. An intervention informant group with
BLTY and caregivers will provide direct input into the development of a culturally informed intervention. Aim 3:
To pilot test the intervention via a randomized controlled trial. The intervention and control condition will be
administered to BLTY and their caregivers to evaluate the intervention’s acceptability, feasibility, and
preliminary efficacy on mental health symptoms. At the conclusion of this award, Dr. Vance will apply his
findings to develop an R-level grant application for a larger RCT of the developed intervention."

Data-driven evaluation and interventions have improved emergency care across an array of acute care
conditions including acute myocardial infarction, stroke and sepsis -- yet, similar systems to support and
advance emergency care for OUD are lacking amidst worsening patient outcomes. Our team completed
foundational data infrastructure work revealing gaps in ED data systems as well as identifying opportunities to
utilize the American College of Emergency Physician's Clinical Emergency Department Registry (CEDR) as a
national data backbone of over 1000 Emergency Departments (EDs) for OUD care. We propose to create new
data processes that will generate a collection of data products embedded within the CEDR ecosystem to
improve the timeliness, quality, accessibility, and usefulness of CEDR data to address the overdose epidemic.
To address these critical needs, we propose an acceleration project that will leverage our prior work
developing and refining electronic health record OUD data elements both within and outside of the CEDR
registry. This proposal will: 1) automate OUD-related data extraction from participating sites, 2) map ED data to
a standardized, scalable Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM)
3) Translate relational data within the CDM into research ready datasets with algorithmic extension of
important OUD concepts, and 4) create site and public facing ED OUD overdose prevention dashboards for
care improvement and surveillance. We hypothesize that the automation and integration of electronic health
record and administrative substance use disorder data into CEDR will improve the ability to identify
opportunities for improvement in ED OUD care and advance future research initiatives. During this study we
plan to assess digital readiness within CEDR and design an enhanced ED OUD data infrastructure
suitable for large scale observational research, support of future real-world clinical trials and benchmarking
dashboards (R61 phase) and develop and deploy an ED OUD digital infrastructure across clinical,
research and surveillance dimensions (R33 phase). Upon study completion, we anticipate an improved
national ED data registry using a standardized common data model, automated site level ED OUD dashboards
to guide near-real time local quality improvement initiatives, the existence of an independent ED OUD Registry
Research dataset, and a public facing, web based near-real time ED OUD care dashboard."

The overall goal of the current K23 project is to support Dr. John Sturgeon’s career development as a clinical
researcher in chronic migraine populations; specific training aims are to expand his training in the areas of clinical
trial design and development, medical and neurological bases of migraine headaches, and the analysis of time-
series, hierarchical, and clinical trials data. Migraines are among the most common medical conditions in the
United States and contribute to substantial work loss, economic burden, and psychosocial disability. Strikingly,
people with chronic migraines (CM) show even greater symptom severity, disability and poorer psychosocial
adjustment to their condition across studies, compared to those with episodic migraine. Effective treatment of
CM necessitates an interdisciplinary approach that emphasizes both medical and non-medical interventions to
address the complex pattern of disability and psychosocial impairment in this population. Behavioral
interventions such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and mindfulness meditation have demonstrated efficacy in
reducing migraine frequency, severity, and disability. However, access to these treatments is poor, particularly
among individuals not receiving care through specialty clinics. Further, many patients are unable to afford either
the financial or time costs associated with traditional behavioral interventions, which typically necessitate weekly
sessions for 2-3 months. Consequently, there is a compelling need to utilize develop brief, accessible, and
empirically validated interventions to improve the quality of CM management nationwide. Aim 1 of the study
proposes to conduct a randomized trial to test the efficacy of a novel, 2-hour single-session behavioral intervention
(“Empowered Relief”; ER) against a health education condition in individuals with CM. Aim 2 of the study proposes
to examine the dynamics of migraine activity, migraine-related disability, medication use, and indicators of
psychological adjustment using daily diary data, an assessment method that is both common in CM management
and desirable for comprehensive statistical modeling. The ER intervention has been validated in both mixed chronic
pain and chronic low back pain samples but, to date, has not been validated in migraine populations. If successful,
the current project will form the basis of a future randomized clinical trial comparing the potential non-inferiority of
the ER intervention against traditional, full-length behavioral interventions for CM.
The specific training experiences in this K23 project form an excellent complement to Dr. Sturgeon’s existing training
as a clinical pain psychologist and analytically-oriented chronic pain researcher. The current project provides a
comprehensive 5-year plan encompassing high-quality mentorship, training, and research to transition Dr. Sturgeon,
to the role of an independently funded researcher with the potential to make a significant impact in the field of
migraine treatment and behavioral clinical trials."

Permanent smell loss is a common morbidity associated with esthesioneuroblastoma (ENB), a tumor thought to
arise from the olfactory epithelium in the nose. This is due to necessity for bulk surgical resection, regardless of
tumor grade. As such, the development of novel medical treatment strategies is necessary to preserve olfaction
in this patient population. The olfactory epithelium is a neurogenic niche that produces neurons and supporting
epithelial cells throughout life, and various undifferentiated stages of normal epithelial proliferation and
development have been observed in ENB. The epigenetic regulator polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) has
been implicated in driving proliferative cell states in stem cell niches throughout the body. We have shown that
PRC2 is crucial for basal cell proliferation in the olfactory epithelium, and we have identified that it is expressed
in proliferating cells in ENB. Because ENB is a rare tumor, mechanistic biological studies are sparse, and no cell
lines or mouse models exist. Furthermore, the majority of ENBs do not share common driver mutations,
emphasizing the importance of epigenetic regulation. Here I propose to utilize newly-developed multi-omic
studies to investigate how PRC2 expression in human ENB specifies cellular states and contributes to tumor
growth. I will perform single cell chromatin and transcriptomic assays on multiple tumors to identify areas of
chromosomal accessibility. Furthermore, I will use pharmacologic assays in human ENB samples to assess the
downstream effects on transcription. Finally, spatial transcriptomics will be used to define ENB cellular and
molecular composition, including PRC-associated expression, and how this compares to normal olfactory
epithelium, to elucidate cellular signaling dynamics among tumor and immune cells within the ENB
microenvironment. Completion of the proposed studies will define epigenetic drivers co-opted by ENB with the
goal of identifying new druggable targets, allowing for improved survival and preservation of smell. Altogether,
the research and training plan outlined in this proposal combined with expert mentorship from Dr. Bradley
Goldstein will prepare me with the rigorous training necessary for a successful career as a surgeon-scientist in
rhinology and anterior skull base surgery."
10898647,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Increases in phospholipase C (PLC) activity have been associated with diseases such as hypertension, and the
current first-line of antihypertensive drugs all target Ca2+ influx that results from PLC activity. However, about
10% of patients with hypertension show resistant hypertension, where blood pressure remains uncontrolled
despite the use of 3+ different antihypertensive drug classes. There is a significant need to find alternative
modulators of PLC activity that are less susceptible to resistance. The downstream lipid produced by PLC,
phosphatidic acid (PA), can regulate PLC signaling by replenishing PLC’s substrate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-
bisphosphate (PIP2). PA is produced downstream of PLC activity by the diacylglycerol kinases (DGK through
DGK) or phospholipase D enzymes (PLD1 and PLD2). The PA then helps to resynthesize PIP2 through
metabolic pathways and through activation of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K). Based on this,
the objective of this proposal is to determine how the various DGK and PLD isozymes contribute to PIP2 levels
and PLC regulation. The rationale of the proposed research is to identify new, druggable, isoform-specific targets
to regulate PLC activity in resistant hypertension. The central hypothesis is that PLC signaling activates a
particular subset of DGK and PLD isozymes that are necessary for PI recycling and PIP5K activity, respectively.
We will test this hypothesis using two specific aims: 1) define the DGK isozymes that function in
phosphatidylinositol recycling and 2) determine the role of the DGK and PLD isozymes in PIP5K activation, PIP2
replenishment and downstream Ca2+ signaling. Our research design includes endogenously-tagging the DGK
and PLD isozymes using a CRISPR/Cas9 approach to see how the different isozymes are activated by PLC
signaling. We will then knockdown the PLC-activated isoforms to see how they affect lipid levels, PIP5K activity,
and Ca2+ influx. The proposed research is significant because it will demonstrate how the specific isoforms of
DGK and PLD regulate PLC activity. This is a critical first step in identifying isoform-specific targets for
antihypertensive drug therapies."
10750965,"Abstract. A central goal of our research program is to develop new platforms for the late-stage
functionalization of small molecules and biomolecules such as proteins. In recent years, these efforts have
focused on the application of photoredox catalysis as a uniquely enabling paradigm in synthetic chemistry.
The distinct features of photocatalysts, in particular their ability to readily effect single-electron transfers
and thereby generate reactive open-shell radical species, have created new opportunities for reaction
development, providing highly enabling, novel bond disconnections in synthetic sequences. An area in
which the application of photoredox catalysis has been notably successful is metallaphotoredox catalysis,
the combination of photocatalysis with transition-metal catalysis. Metallaphotoredox platforms facilitate
entry into reaction platforms that enable non-traditional partners to participate in cross-coupling chemistry.
Accordingly, efforts by our group and others have addressed many long-standing synthetic challenges. This
research proposal outlines new fields in which photoredox protocols have the potential to achieve
significant impact. The objective of Research Program I is to develop new photoredox-mediated
methodologies that will enable the selective bioconjugation of tyrosine and methionine residues in native
proteins for application in drug delivery and bioimaging. In Research Program II, we propose to harness
the ability of photoredox catalysis to reversibly cleave and form C–H bonds. This strategy will facilitate
hydrogen isotope exchange and will enable dynamic control of C–H stereochemistry for application in
uphill isomerizations and dynamic kinetic resolutions. Finally, Research Program III aims to explore
novel directions in metallaphotoredox catalysis, such as harnessing photoredox activation modes to
circumvent challenging elementary steps in copper and cobalt catalysis, as well as to expand the utility and
scope of nickel/photoredox dual catalysis."
10750966,"SUMMARY. Vaccination is one of the most important public health achievements in history. However, we are
still unable to induce protective immunity against important human pathogens, such as influenza. Thus,
infectious diseases remain a major cause of disability and death. An essential component of a “successful”
vaccine is the ability to generate long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs) AND memory B cells, which produce
protective antibodies (Ab) and provide long-term prophylactic immunity. Importantly, the development of LLPCs
and memory B cells occurs in the germinal center (GC). Thus, it is essential to understand the mechanisms
that control the GC reaction. However, despite significant advances in the field, our understanding of the
mechanisms that control the GC responses is still limited. One of the critical gaps in our knowledge is how “GC
fate decisions” are regulated, particularly how GC B cells “choose” between staying in the GC to differentiate
into highly mutated LLPCs or becoming memory B cells and leave the GCs. The lack of precise knowledge of
the mechanisms that fine-tune the output of the GC is one of the main limitations when designing new
vaccination strategies to overcome individual pathogen adaptions. In this regard, previous studies demonstrate
that preexisting influenza-specific memory B cells in the lungs provide critical protection after reinfection.
However, the factors that control the generation of lung memory B cell responses remain elusive. We believe
this knowledge will be essential for designing more efficient vaccination strategies against respiratory viruses,
such as influenza or SARS-CoV2. Importantly, CD4+ T follicular helper (Tfh) cells play a fundamental role in
promoting GC B cell responses. In fact, in the absence of Tfh cells, GC responses and Ab-mediated protection
are impaired. Thus, it is generally believed that an “enhanced” Tfh cell response after vaccination will
significantly improve the efficacy of vaccines. Unfortunately, we still do not know what functional properties
define a “high-quality” Tfh cell response. Our preliminary data demonstrate that, as the immune response
progresses, the influenza-specific Tfh cell response “evolves.” As a consequence, different subsets of Tfh cells
are present at different times after influenza infection. Based on our data, we hypothesize that GC B cells
interacting with different “flavors” of Tfh cells at different times after infection receive qualitatively different
signals, which temporarily fine-tunes the output of the GC and the generation of lung memory B cells. The
long-term goals of this application are 1) To determine the role played by distinct subsets of Tfh cells in
controlling the memory/LLPC differentiation balance. 2) To define the mechanisms that regulate the generation
of “high quality” Tfh cells with the ability to promote enhanced B cell-mediated protection against respiratory
viruses. 3) To determine the molecular and transcriptional mechanisms that control the generation of
pulmonary memory B cells and the memory/LLPC differentiation balance in the GCs. We believe this
knowledge will be essential for designing new vaccination strategies tailored against respiratory viruses."
10750967,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most rapidly rising cause of cancer mortality in the United States. The
majority of patients with HCC present with incurable disease at diagnosis and, despite the approval of targeted
therapies, life expectancy remains less than 20 months. The diagnosis of HCC as well as its response to
treatment rely primarily on imaging biomarkers which have replaced tissue-based methods. Recent studies
demonstrate that the dismal prognosis for these patients issues, at least in part, from deficiencies of current
clinical imaging paradigms in diagnosing HCC as well as in identifying residual or recurrent HCC after treatment.
Clinical imaging paradigms for HCC diagnosis and the assessment of treatment response are based on anatomic
imaging features that often fail to identify HCCs or provide functional measures of response to targeted therapies.
Indeed, the sensitivity of standard-of-care (SOC) contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI for small HCCs can be as low as
20%. Similarly, SOC imaging provides inadequate assessments of response to therapies. Addressing this
deficiency requires the development of new imaging paradigms that provide functional measures of HCC biology
to improve accuracy, sensitivity and specificity as well as inform the application of therapeutics.
The development of novel functional imaging strategies for HCC has been limited by the absence of
methodologies that can tailor imaging probe selection to the relevant HCC biology as well as a dearth of
representative animal models. Using genome editing and metabolomics, our laboratory has demonstrated the
fundamental dependence of HCC cells on lactate dehydrogenase and NADPH-dependent reductases to be
promising imaging targets for Dynamic Nuclear Polarization 13Carbon Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic
Imaging (DNP-13C-MRSI), an emerging imaging technology. The proposed project will build on this prior work to
study the ability of DNP-13C-MRSI to: 1) improve the accuracy of diagnosis and treatment response assessment
of HCC following SOC therapies as compared to conventional imaging and 2) inform treatment selection.
We hypothesize that DNP-13C-MRSI provides a unique technology through which to leverage fundamental
enzymatic dependencies of HCC cells and enable functional molecular imaging for diagnosis and treatment
response assessment. To test this hypothesis the proposed project will use unique animal models of HCC
developed in our lab to pursue three aims: (1) to optimize a DNP-13C-MRSI pulse sequence that enables
sensitive, accurate and reproducible measurements of regional pyruvate metabolism in autochthonous HCCs
at high spatial resolution; (2) to determine the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of DNP-13C-MRSI of HP 1-13C-
pyruvate uptake and metabolism for identifying HCCs; and (3) to determine the accuracy of DNP-13C-MRSI of
HP 1-13C-pyruvate and/or 1-13C-dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) for identifying and characterizing residual
disease/local recurrence following TAE as compared to SOC imaging. The achievement of the proposed aims
holds the potential to transform the imaging and treatment of patients with HCC, a devastating disease."

Extracellular vesicle mediated epigenetic silencing of HIV in the brain
Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV) is a lentivirus that causes a persistent viral infection and
results in the demise of immune regulatory cells. Clearance of HIV infection by the immune system is
inefficient, and integration of provirus into the genome of host cells provides a means for long-term
persistence and latency which require lifelong anti-retroviral therapy. Moreover, it is becoming apparent
that HIV-infected monocyte/macrophages represent a sanctuary for HIV-1 in central nervous system
(CNS), where they appear to contribute to HIV-associated neurological disorders (HAND). A
methodology that can specifically target and epigenetically silence HIV provirus within virus infected
microglial cells in the brain could be one means by which to develop a functional cure and possibly a
treatment for HAND. We recently developed a zinc finger epigenetic repressor that can epigenetically
silence HIV in the brain when delivered by extracellular vesicles (EVs) intravenously. We propose here
to contrast this recombinant zinc finger approach EV approach with a small hairpin RNA (shRNA) EV
approach, which is also targeted to the LTR to epigenetically silence HIV transcription. The premise of
this proposal is that cellular-derived EVs can be used to deliver novel anti-HIV zinc finger or LTR
targeted transcriptional modulating shRNAs to the brain and epigenetically silence HIV. We propose 3
aims here to test the hypothesis that cellular derived receptor targeted EVs containing anti-HIV zinc
finger and the LTR directed shRNA, both regulators of HIV transcription that utilize endogenous cellular
epigenetic silencing mechanisms (3-5, 14), can spread systemically in vivo and stably silence HIV
transcription. We will test this hypothesis here in vivo using a modular extracellular vesicle (EV) delivery
approach, whereby by neural stem cells (NSC) will be engineered such that they constitutively generate
anti-HIV EVs capable of cell directed stable epigenetic silencing of HIV. If successful the approach
outlined here may not only result in the epigenetic silencing of HIV in the brain but also help usher in a
new generation of EV-RNA therapies that can operate seamlessly with endogenous cellular
mechanisms to target epigenetic regulation of gene transcription."
10877012,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The global rate of HIV infection and the number of AIDS related deaths have dramatically declined due to the
expanding access to combinatorial anti-retroviral therapy (cART). However, the HIV epidemic remains and
there is still no cure for HIV infection. Because cART does not eradicate HIV, while replication-competent
viruses become integrated and silenced proviruses, which can be sporadically reactivated to replenish viral
reservoirs. As a key anatomical “sanctuary site” for HIV infection and persistence/latency, reservoirs in brain
remains a main hurdle for HIV cure. HIV-infected monocytes contribute to viral spread from the periphery blood
to the brain as they can migrate across the blood brain barrier (BBB) and differentiate into microglia in the
central nervous system (CNS). Microglia are a major and stable viral reservoir for persistent/latent HIV
infection in the CNS, even in the presence of cART. Furthermore, HIV-infected microglia release neurotoxic
factors that promote neuroinflammation and contribute to HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND).
Therefore, characterization of molecular features regulating HIV persistent/latent infection in microglia is
essential for developing effective intervention strategies to control and inhibit HIV in the CNS. Epigenetic
regulation critically determines the faith of HIV proviruses and contributes significantly to HIV latency. The
focus of this project is to investigate the role of host epigenetic regulation in promoting persistent/latent HIV
infection in microglia and target it for preventing HIV lytic reactivation. We have identified a set of Jumonji
domain-containing histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) as HIV latency-promoting genes (LPGs) that
preferentially target histone H3K4/K36 methylation (H3K4/K36me3), which indicates the potential role of
histone demethylation in regulation of HIV latency. In Aim 1, we will investigate the contribution of these KDMs
to promoting HIV latency in human microglia and iPSC-derived microglia containing organoids (MCOs). In Aim
2, encouraged by the KDM studies, we would like to continue the use of our functional genomic and proteomic
expertise to identify other ovel host factors governing HIV latency in microglia by multidisciplinary approaches,
including single-cell CRISPR screen. This is an important issue to address so that we can novel host targets to
develop more potent regimen for reinforcing HIV latency and preventing its resurrection at a cART-free setting
in microglia. Furthermore, we also screened a library of FDA-approved drugs and identify HIV latency-
promoting agents (LPAs), including levosimendan (LSM). In Aim 3, we propose the translational studies to
investigate the repurposing of FDA-approved drugs already used in clinic for treating and blocking HIV
persistent/latent infection in microglia, which likely affect epigenetic processes."
10851707,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alcohol consumption and related behaviors can account for the third-highest cause of preventable death in the
United States. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has altered how individuals consume alcohol, which creates
a need for new strategies to help and protect the health of individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD). Studies
in animal models suggest that exercise can help improve negative affective behaviors associated with
abstinence from alcohol exposure. The insular cortex (IC) is a key component in brain circuitry, contributing to
synaptic changes in the extended amygdala during abstinence. We have demonstrated that the IC is critical for
expressing negative affective behaviors that emerge from forced alcohol abstinence in mice. The primary
motor cortex (MOp) regulates essential information between the IC and extended amygdala during affective
behaviors. Voluntary exercise, a behavior dependent on the MOp, causes rapid changes in IC activity in mice.
Mice exposed to chronic alcohol intake display negative affective and aversion-resistant behaviors following
forced abstinence which is mitigated by exposure to intermittent voluntary wheel running access. There is a
need to gain insight into the interconnection of the MOp-IC to determine how exercise modulates forced
abstinence-associated behavior following alcohol consumption. The inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA is
associated with negative affect in humans. GABAergic somatostatin interneurons (SST-INs) are rich in the
neocortex and have been critical in regulating negative affective behaviors in rodent models of substance use
disorders. Our data suggest that GABA in the IC plays an important role in stress responsiveness. My
preliminary data indicates that MOp neuronal projections innervate IC SST-INs. We need further investigation
of MOp-IC microcircuitry to understand how activity within it might be altered by chronic alcohol intake. This
information has led me to hypothesize that exercise can decrease negative affect and aversion
resistance during abstinence from alcohol via the MOp-insula microcircuit connectivity. Within this
fellowship, I will first determine the MOp-mid-IC microcircuit inter-connectivity in the mouse brain via
electrophysiological methods. I follow up on these results by investigating how alcohol mediates IC
microcircuitry. I will then observe the behavioral implications of this circuit by testing if exercise during alcohol
abstinence promotes alterations in the IC SST-IN activity. Completion of this F31 grant will provide me with
new techniques and skills to help me advance in my career as an independent academic researcher."

 Immune suppression and bone marrow dysfunction are ubiquitous among critically ill patients. Short
term, this places an already vulnerable population at additional risk of life-threatening infections. Long term,
immune suppression can persist in the form of chronic critical illness which significantly worsens functional
outcomes. There is a need to rescue immune function early in the care of critically ill patients to avoid
detrimental short and long term consequences of critical illness. Many studies have attempted to do this but
have generally failed, and targetable therapies are still lacking. This may be in part due to lack of consideration
about the integral role of the gut microbiome in regulating hematopoiesis and immune function.
 Emerging research has identified fundamental links between immunity and the gut microbiome. An
onslaught of publications have shown the microbiome shapes the immune system at various stages, including
during hematopoiesis. Recent murine studies have illustrated antibiotic induced dysbiosis impairs
hematopoiesis and suppresses bone marrow function. Clinically, our group completed some of the first
genomic studies illustrating microbiota derangements in critically ill patients, likely as a result of liberal use of
antibiotics. In addition to antibiotics, most critically ill patients rely on enteral nutrition which shapes their
microbiome. Previously we have shown artificial enteral nutrition (AEN), the default and most commonly used
formula for patients requiring enteral nutrition promotes dysbiosis. In contrast, high fiber plant based enteral
nutrition is well tolerated, promotes the growth of healthy commensal gut anaerobes, and improves outcomes
in murine models. In this proposal, unpublished data demonstrates PBEN is superior to AEN in mitigating ABx
induced lymphopenia, anemia, and neutrophilia. We also provide evidence that critically ill patients randomized
to PBEN have higher lymphocyte and lower neutrophil counts than those that received AEN. Still, how
antibiotics and diet shape hematopoiesis after ABx induced bone marrow suppression has never been directly
tested. Here, we will test the hypothesis that PBEN expedites immune recovery from antibiotic-induced
bone marrow suppression via repopulation of the gut with SCFA producing commensals that mitigate
myeloid skewing by 1) evaluating if PBEN is superior to AEN in restoring steady state balance between
myelopoiesis and lymphopoiesis in the bone marrow during recovery from ABx induced bone marrow
suppression and 2) testing the hypothesis that expedited immune recovery from ABx induced bone marrow
suppression with PBEN is mediated by microbial production of short chain fatty acids. Completion of these
aims will highlight nutrition as a previously underappreciated therapeutic target for improving immune recovery
of critically ill patients."
10984449,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Glioblastoma is the most common primary brain cancer worldwide. Novel treatment strategies are
urgently needed since glioblastoma is nearly universally fatal with a median overall survival of only 1.5-
2 years. A frustrating aspect of glioblastoma is that approximately half of all patients will have what
looks to be tumor growth on their post-treatment MRI, termed progression. Although, half of patients
with progression will turn out to have pseudoprogression, which is a not-fully understood phenomenon
believed to be edema and inflammation caused by the immune system and represents a good response
to treatment. In fact, patients with pseudoprogression tend to do better than the general glioblastoma
population and have a median overall survival of up to 3 years. On the other hand, patients with true
progression of disease (tumor growth and poor/nonresponse to treatment) tend to do worse than the
general glioblastoma population and have a medial overall survival of only 10 months. The frustrating
part for clinical team, and the patients themselves, is that true progression and pseudoprogression are
not discernable from one another during treatment, or even on initial post-treatment imaging (1-month
post-treatment). Instead, the current gold-standard to distinguish between true and pseudoprogression
is to “watch and wait” – continue monitoring with serial imaging and see if the patient clinically worsens
or stabilizes. Thus, there is an unmet need for techniques that reliably and accurately determine if tumor
growth/progression is occurring during treatment and predict/determine which sub-type of progression
(true progression or pseudoprogression) a patient has. My laboratory focuses on responding to this
unmet need through a variety of methods: serial multiparametric MRI (anatomic, perfusion, diffusion,
spectroscopic, etc.), quantitative MRI analysis, machine learning, and molecular research including
analyzing blood samples of glioblastoma patients to look for circulating tumor cells and other molecular
markers. This proposal focuses on auto-detection of tumors on MRI based on machine learning (Aim
1) and analysis of anatomic and physiologic changes (Aim 2) from daily multiparametric MRI to address
this issue by creating techniques that can detect enlarging tumors during treatment and predict between
true and pseudoprogression months earlier than current methods. The goal of this proposal is to develop
tools that identify and monitor patients with significant anatomic and/or physiologic tumor changes much
earlier than current methods, so that in the future, prompt, aggressive, and early therapy adaption can
be implemented. This project will translate directly to the practice of clinical medicine and advance the
field of glioblastoma treatment. Additionally, it will allow me to gain hands-on skills and expertise in
machine learning, radiomics, MRI, neuroimaging, neuro-anatomy, radiation therapy, and oncology, and
aid in preparing me for a career as an academic physician scientist in the field of radiation oncology."
10904676,"A fundamental question of developmental biology is to understand how a limited number of signaling pathways
direct the specification of many cell types. One such signaling pathway is the canonical Wnt signaling pathway,
which is highly conserved across animals, plays a role in a myriad of developmental processes, and its
dysregulation is common in disease. To direct different developmental outcomes, Wnt signaling must activate
different gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in different contexts. To reveal general principles of how Wnt ligands
can activate unique GRNs, I will use Hydra vulgaris to discover how two distinct cell types uniquely respond to
the Wnt signaling pathway. Hydra offer several advantages for studying Wnt directed-GRNs: 1) Hydra is a
relatively simple organism and we have molecularly and spatially defined all cell types and 2) the adult Hydra is
in a constant state of development such that all developmental pathways, including the Wnt-directed pathways,
are continuously active. Wnt signaling is high at Hydra’s oral end (i.e., the head) and directs the differentiation
of multiple distinct oral cell fates. The principal effect of canonical Wnt signaling is the stabilization of the beta-
catenin (Bcat) protein, which together with its binding partner TCF activates transcription of target genes. To
activate target gene expression in specific developmental contexts, Bcat/TCF must work in a combinatorial
fashion with other TFs. However, it is largely unknown what TFs are facilitating the activation of Wnt targets and
whether these interactions are conserved across species and during disease. Based on my preliminary data,
I hypothesize that ectodermal Homeobox TFs and endodermal bHLH TFs work in a combinatorial manner
with Bcat/TCF to direct cell-type specific GRN modules in Hydra. Towards testing this hypothesis, I will use
ChIP-seq to identify the cell-type specific direct targets of Bcat/TCF in the two oral epithelial cell types of Hydra
(ectoderm and endoderm) (Aim 1). I will then use our Hydra single cell Atlas to determine the expression pattern
of the direct targets. To determine if direct targets are co-regulated by Homeobox or bHLH TFs, I will knockdown
these TFs in the epithelial cells to test if they are required for specification. I will then identify the Wnt target
genes that also require these TFs for proper expression by conducting RNA-seq on the knockdown Hydra (Aim
2). Finally, I will perform unbiased approaches to identify additional co-regulating TFs for functional testing (Aim
3), which will also provide alternative hypotheses if needed. Upon completion of this project, I will have generated
a comprehensive list of the primary targets of Bcat/TCF in Hydra and potentially have discovered a role for
Homeobox and bHLH TFs in differentially regulating these primary targets. ChIP experiments conducted in mice,
have shown that Bcat can bind specific Homeobox TFs to control target gene expression in different
developmental contexts. Therefore, my results could suggest a deeply conserved role for Homeobox TFs in
regulating different Wnt targets in different developmental contexts from cnidarians to bilaterians."

and muscle weakness, provide a strong rationale for rehabilitation; yet few formal studies exist and the effects
of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection on function are not well described. Notably, two-
thirds of Veterans are overweight and obese, rendering excess adiposity a significant risk factor and a high-
priority area related to PCC prevention and care. Obesity increases the risk of severe illness in Veterans
recovering from PCC, but how it does so is not fully understood.
 Recent research suggests that excess adipose tissue is associated with adverse changes in adipose
cellular function, and that these variations may be involved in the biology of aging and the etiology of aging-
related diseases. Adipose tissue contains cells that have undergone cellular senescence, which induces
inflammation, cytotoxicity, and metabolic dysfunction in other cells and tissues. However, the precise role of
adipose tissue cellular composition on PCC recovery is limited.
 Thus, we propose to evaluate the role of obesity and PCC on physical functioning, health-related quality of
life (HRQOL), and systemic and adipose tissue inflammatory and cellular senescence profiles in ethnically
diverse older Veterans from the Audie Murphy (San Antonio) and Baltimore VA Medical Centers. Further, we
propose a randomized controlled trial to determine whether a reduction in body weight and increased physical
function by a weight loss intervention (WL), including dietary modification and exercise, in obese Veterans with
PCC will reduce systemic and adipose tissue inflammation and senescence, which will have important
implications for PCC recovery. We will pursue the following aims:
Aim 1: To compare physical function, body composition, HRQOL, PCC symptoms, and adipose tissue
molecular profiling in four cohorts of Veterans at baseline: lean PCC naïve, lean with PCC, obese PCC naïve,
and obese with PCC (N=150).
Aim 2: To compare in Veterans with obesity: a) a 12-week randomized WL vs. weight stability (WS)
intervention (30/group) on physical function, body composition, HRQOL, and PCC symptoms together with
changes in the global molecular profile in adipose tissue in Veterans with PCC and b) the WL intervention in
PCC naïve vs. with PCC (N=30/group) on these outcomes.
 Older (55-80 years) men and women Veterans will be recruited. We will perform a standard functional
battery (maximal aerobic capacity [VO2max; primary outcome], usual gait speed, six min walk distance, timed
up and go, and handgrip strength), body composition (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry and computed
tomography scans), HRQOL (NIH PROMIS-57), and PCC symptoms (COVID-19 Yorkshire Rehabilitation
Scale [C19-YRS]) and adipose tissue will be collected. Further, we will test, in a randomized controlled trial, the
hypothesis that a WL intervention, compared to weight stability (WS), improves physical function, body
composition, and HRQOL and reduces inflammation and senescent cell burden and to a similar extent as the
PCC naïve group with obesity.
 A deeper understanding of the relationship between adipose tissue and PCC will likely reveal factors that
predispose to or protect against aging-related functional declines. Moreover, a better understanding of the
effects of a lifestyle intervention on the molecular profile of adipose tissue will help to determine how changes
in adipose tissue contribute to PCC and PCC recovery. Lastly, this research will provide important mechanistic
insights into how cellular senescence influences the pathophysiology of physical, mental, and social

10930969,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Fatty liver disease (FLD) is a major public health issue that affects millions of people worldwide. The two major
subtypes of FLD include alcoholic FLD (AFLD) and nonalcoholic FLD (NAFLD) although the threshold of alcohol
intake for subdivision is controversial. FLD is defined by excess fat in the liver and can lead to a more profound
disease state of steatohepatitis (SH) in which there is liver inflammation/damage that may be reflected in hepatic
fibrosis. SH can lead to liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma. Major risk factors predisposing individuals to
the development of FLD include biological factors (obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes) demographic
characteristics (e.g., sex, age and ethnicity), behavioral and lifestyle-related variables (e.g., alcohol intake,
dietary behavior and physical activity), and other environmental factors (e.g., infectious agents such as hepatitis
viruses, microbiome variability, exposure to pollutants/contaminants/toxins). Hispanics are disparately impacted
by NAFLD with the highest observed prevalence of NAFLD in the world.
Risk for NAFLD is due to a complex mixture of genetic and environmental factors and their interactions that are
still largely unidentified. Quantitative endophenotypes (i.e., biomarkers that are genetically correlated with
disease risk) have important properties that can speed the discovery of disease-related genetic causal factors
and aid in individual-level risk estimation. Here we propose a novel deep cellular phenotyping assessment of
induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived hepatocyte response to experimental lipid overload challenge,
which mimics dietary lipid overfeeding. This experimental epidemiological study will allow us to rigorously test
for genotype-by-environment interactions (GEI) to better understand the etiology/mechanisms of NAFLD risk
and to enhance early detection and halt progression. Specifically, we will identify novel iPSC-derived
hepatocellular endophenotypes involved in NAFLD risk in Mexican Americans, a health disparity population,
using a high-throughput multiomic approach. The study will use existing data and cellular biosamples from 900
participants in our longitudinal Mexican American Family Study (MAFS), who have been extensively phenotyped
(including liver MRI) and genetically characterized. Our specific aims include: 1) discovery of novel hepatocellular
cellular endophenotypes for NAFLD risk by quantitative genome-wide RNA sequencing and functional evaluation
of hepatocytes derived from existing iPSCs in 400 subjects; (2) discovery of multivariate hepatocellular
transcriptional coherence endophenotypes using single-cell sequencing; and (3) confirmation of the highest
ranking NAFLD endophenotypes using MRI-derived liver fat measures from an additional 500 MAFS subjects
from the same families.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common causes of chronic liver disease and it
disparately affects minority populations, with Hispanics being one of the highest at-risk populations. By identifying
genetically determined cellular endophenotypes, we hope to speed the identification of potential causal genes
in NAFLD risk and for identifying non-invasive early biomarkers of genetic risk for NAFLD."

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by an extended episode of a persistent feeling of sadness or
a lack of interest in outside stimuli. It is among the most common mental illnesses, affecting 16.2% of individuals
in the US during their lifetime. MDD is a heterogeneous disorder with a variable clinical course, an inconsistent
response to treatment, and little established etiology. Arguably, our lack of understanding of the causes of the
disorder hinders improvements in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.
Multiple risk factors predispose MDD, including demographic characteristics (e.g., sex, age, and ethnicity),
behavior and lifestyle-related modifications (e.g., addiction, socioeconomic status, immigration status, stressful
life events), and both endogenous (e.g., infectious agents) and exogenous environmental factors (e.g., exposure
to pollutants/contaminants/toxins). In addition, MDD risk is substantially heritable. However, our ability to identify
novel environmental risk factors has been limited by a lack of sufficiently broad environmental measures.
Recently, evidence has been accumulating that exposure to pollutants influences the risk of MDD, although most
studies have employed indirect exposure estimates. Here we propose to measure person-specific levels of
organic and inorganic pollutants to search for environmental determinants of recurrent MDD (rMDD) risk in large
multigenerational pedigrees from the Mexican American Family Study (MAFS). A wealth of phenotypic and
genetic information exists on the members of the randomly ascertained families in this cohort. Specifically, we
previously documented high rates of depression in these families, estimated the heritability of rMDD (h2=0.46),
and localized genetic loci using linkage and whole genome sequencing (WGS) approaches. Recently, we
developed a novel family-based approach to control for genetic factors and thereby increase the power to detect
causal environmental signals influencing disease risk. This analytic approach makes it possible to optimally
detect novel environmentally driven determinants of rMDD risk. Given the pedigree-based design and preexisting
phenotypic and WGS data, the MAFS cohort provides a powerful efficient resource for studying environmental
components of rMDD risk and will provide important new insights into the etiology/mechanisms of MDD risk. Our
specific aims are: 1) to obtain individual-level direct measures of the pollutome including a set of 72 persistent
organic pollutants and 28 metals in banked plasma samples from two time points and indirect spatially-imputed
measures of air pollutant exposure; 2) to detect the influence of pollutants on rMDD risk using a novel statistical
approach to control for the effect of genetic factors to maximize environmental pollutant signals; 3) to detect
genotype×pollutome interactions in rMDD risk; and 4) to replicate results in an independent set of 750 Mexican
American individuals from the Rio Grande Valley Family Study using similar protocols to that of the MAFS.
Overall, our project proposes to use genomic tools in a novel way to enhance the identification of environmental
risk factors and to foster the study of human genotype×environment interaction. The study also will provide an
exciting resource for training students in the value of genomics for environmental epidemiology."

Because of widespread concerns about health care quality and safety, disparities in access and outcomes for
vulnerable populations, and the desire to rapidly move evidence-based therapies into practice, there is a critical
need to train and develop a highly competent, multidisciplinary workforce of future leaders in health services
research (HSR). This application proposes to build on a nine-year history of successful joint training programs
and research collaborations to launch a new University of Chicago And Northwestern University Postdoctoral
HSR Program, referred to as the “UCANU Postdoctoral HSR Program”, which will use an innovative,
competency-based curriculum to train candidates from diverse personal and professional backgrounds in
traditional HSR, learning health system methods, implementation science, health disparities research, data
science, and systems science. Our robust, comprehensive training architecture incorporates didactics, mentored
research, and professional development activities that maximize the complementary strengths of University of
Chicago (UC) and Northwestern University (NU) in the diverse metropolitan city of Chicago. Together, we will
train the next generation of health services researchers who will conduct and lead rigorous, reproducible health
services research using both experimental and observational study designs and quantitative, qualitative, and
mixed methods research. To achieve this goal, we will: (1) administer a two-institution (UC and NU) training
program that integrates numerous complementary resources for training and career development, including
didactics, conferences (including joint seminars with all UCANU trainees and faculty), mentoring, and other
professional development activities; and (2) leverage the exceptional expertise of faculty mentors at both
institutions to ensure that fellows attain the knowledge, skills, and experiences required to transition into careers
that sustain innovative, independently-funded health services research. Our program will invite applications from
a diverse pool of candidates who have completed a PhD or clinical doctoral training and residency or fellowship
(e.g., MD, DPT), and it will support the training of four positions per year (two at UC, two at NU). Fellows will
have their primary home at the institution that best fits their needs for faculty mentorship and training, including
access to graduate degree programs. Fellows may earn a Master of Science in Public Health Sciences for
Clinical Professionals at UC or a Master of Science in Health Services and Outcomes Research at NU. An
advisory board will oversee all training along with a Postdoctoral HSR Program Steering Committee that
intentionally includes leadership and faculty mentors from both NU and UC to optimize coordination and
collaboration between the two sites. Over the next five years, we will leverage the vast, remarkable strengths of
our combined universities to train and prepare the next generation of diverse scientists whose careers will employ
the power of rigorous and innovative HSR to improve healthcare delivery and access, increase implementation
of evidence, maximize health outcomes, and eliminate health disparities."

The learning healthcare system is designed to “generate and apply the best evidence for the collaborative
healthcare choices of each patient and provider, drive the process of discovery as a natural outgrowth of
patient care, and ensure innovation, quality, safety, and value in healthcare.”
Vanderbilt is committed to continuing in the development of a cadre of scientists formally trained and well
versed in best methods for integrating scientific discovery, evidence implementation, and evaluation of health
policies within the learning healthcare system. We have a strong track record of training fellows and improving
patient outcomes. We propose to renew the Vanderbilt Patient, pRactice Outcomes and Research in
Effectiveness and Systems Science (PROgRESS) Program to cross train post-doctoral investigators with a
focus in the learning healthcare system's three core disciplines: 1) Patient Centered Outcomes Research - To
determine which strategies are most effective for patients; 2) Implementation Science - To implement and
evaluate those effective strategies into practice; and 3) Health Policy/ Community Health - To influence policy
to benefit all patients and improve health of the population and community.
By cross training researchers, we will draw together groups of trainees and mentors to model team science.
We provide role models to junior investigators and forums that demonstrate the intellectual productivity and
practical benefits of interdisciplinary research in advancing human health. We endorse team approaches to
filling gaps in knowledge and translating knowledge into application that leads to improvement in the
populations' health. A robust and diverse pool of talented applicants is available with more applicants each
year than spaces available in the program. We have a thriving Implementation Science program, a well-
positioned Department of Health Policy, and diverse partners including Meharry Medical College and
Vanderbilt University School of Nursing.
PROgRESS trainees will continue to access faculty mentors with sustained federal funding who have an
extensive track record of mentoring trainees. Each trainee's Scholarship Oversight Committee (SOC) will draw
from an experienced pool of mentors in the three areas of focus: Patient Centered Outcomes Research,
Implementation Science, and Health Policy/Community Health. The program will continue to provide: 1)
advanced didactics, including a degree program or focused classwork; 2) formal mentorship that prepares
trainees for K-level training; and 3) experiential learning through the conduct of a research project. Trainees
will be supported by a broad array of institutional resources for training and development, including: Work in
Progress, Clinical Quality and Implementation Research Scholarly Series and journal clubs, Biostatistics
Seminars, clinical and translational seminars, and peer-mentoring activities. Taken together, these resources
provide an optimal environment for developing the next generation of learning health system scientists."

Bariatric surgery is a potent treatment for obesity-related metabolic disease and markedly improves glucose
control in T2D. However, along with this metabolic success comes an increased risk of severe hypoglycemia
(termed post-bariatric hypoglycemia, or PBH), with estimated prevalence of up to 30% of patients after both
gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. Current therapies for PBH are limited and incompletely effective, and
individuals with severe hypoglycemia and unawareness lack sufficient warning to treat before rapid onset of
neuroglycopenia and impaired safety.
Previous studies of PBH by our group and others have demonstrated potential drivers of hypoglycemia in this
condition: (1) increased insulin secretion, linked to postprandial incretin secretion (including GLP1), (2) increased
insulin-independent glucose uptake, (3) reduced secretion of glucagon and other counterregulatory hormones,
and (4) altered intestinal metabolism. One promising approach to prevent and treat severe hypoglycemia in PBH
is closed-loop glucagon therapy. In prior studies, we collaborated with engineering colleagues to develop and
test a closed-loop system which utilized CGM in combination with a novel closed-loop algorithm to detect
incipient meal-related hypoglycemia and deliver boluses of glucagon via a patch pump. Using a double-blind,
placebo-controlled crossover pilot study in the clinical research unit, we demonstrated efficacy and safety of this
closed-loop glucagon pump system, with increased nadir glucose after mixed meal and reduced need for rescue
glucose. Buoyed by the success of these meal-focused studies, we now propose to further define glucagon
sensitivity, secretion, and turnover and glycogen metabolism in PBH, in order to develop an enhanced, more
effective, closed-loop glucagon algorithm and clinical therapeutic system responsive to glycemic excursions
which occur not only during the postprandial period, but also during overnight hours and during/after activity.
To achieve this goal, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team including clinical investigators with expertise
in PBH and glucagon and glucose metabolism, and biomedical engineers with expertise and an established track
record in closed-loop pump system development and clinical testing and implementation. Thus, the proposed
studies will address an important knowledge and therapeutic gap in PBH, and provide four innovative
deliverables to advance our understanding of and the clinical care of this challenging patient population: (1) key
quantitative data for glucagon sensitivity, secretion and turnover and glycogen metabolism as contributors to
hypoglycemia during postprandial, postabsorptive, and post-activity states in PBH, (2) development of an in silico
model of the PBH patient, allowing implementation and testing of a novel CLG algorithm, (3) implementation of
the CLG algorithm in a system driving on-body pump delivery of microdoses of glucagon guided by CGM data,
and (4) after regulatory approval, completion of a pilot randomized outpatient, hotel-based clinical trial of the
CLG system in patients with PBH."

Discrimination between threatening and non-threatening contexts is an adaptive neurobiological process,
whereas traumatic stressors may shift responses toward generalization. From a translational perspective, the
loss of discrimination, or over-generalization, from a stressful to neutral context is one of the core features of
stress-related psychiatric diseases. To date, many studies have made inroads in understanding memory
consolidation processes in terms of overall memory strength, yet the post-learning processes that underlie
discrimination vs. generalization remain poorly understood. New data from our research team suggests that
limbic forebrain influences over the anteroventral bed nuclei of the stria terminalis (avBST) are poised to
differentially regulate memory strength and discrimination following an aversive learning paradigm. Interestingly,
these data further suggest a role for the basomedial amygdala (BMA) and rostral prelimbic (rPL) subdivision of
the medial prefrontal cortex in modulating memory strength and generalization, respectively, via direct influences
through avBST. Notably, activation of limbic cortical inputs to avBST supports different aspects of memory
modulation, whereas the disengagement of each input may exaggerate fear memory and generalization via
diminished activation over distinct circuits within avBST. This proposed work will address the hypothesis that
activity in BMA/rPL–avBST circuits play distinct roles over memory strength and discrimination with both
glucocorticoid-dependent and independent components. Aim 1 will address the roles of the rPL–avBST and
BMA–avBST pathways and the avBST itself in modulating precision and memory strength following inhibitory
avoidance learning. Aim 2 will assess whether the effects of avBST and BMA-avBST inhibition on memory
consolidation depends on their effects on circulating glucocorticoids in the posttraining period. Aim 3 will focus
on the sites of action within specific circuits in which glucocorticoids are having their effects on memory strength
and/or precision. These findings will be instrumental for improving our understanding of how these circuits
influence memory strength vs. precision in the period following an aversive learning experience and determine
the degree to which these effects depend on alterations in glucocorticoids vs. direct influences on neuronal
processes within the brain."
10756102,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The development of novel cartilage regeneration and osteoarthritis (OA) treatments is limited by our
incomplete understanding of how certain molecular activities in cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) are linked
to its matrix assembly and biomechanical functions. This project will study the activities of decorin, a small
leucine rich proteoglycan (SLRP), which appears to be critical for the assembly and stability of the aggrecan
network, a major constituent of cartilage ECM. The overall objective is to determine the roles of decorin in
regulating the assembly of the aggrecan network in healthy and degenerative cartilage. Our central hypothesis
is that decorin acts as a “physical linker” to regulate the assembly of the aggrecan network in cartilage ECM,
and this role enables the establishment of the normal biomechanical function of cartilage during joint
development, and delays cartilage degeneration in OA by increasing the retention of fragmented aggrecan.
 We will elucidate the roles of decorin in normal cartilage ECM assembly (Aim 1) and in OA-associated
cartilage degradation (Aim 2), respectively. In Aim 1, we will first determine whether decorin is essential for the
proper biomechanical function of normal cartilage during post-natal growth. Next, we will determine whether
decorin increases the retention of aggrecan in the forming neo-matrix of chondrocytes under dynamic loading,
and if decorin also regulates chondrocyte anabolic response to growth factors. In Aim 2, we will first determine
whether decorin slows down cartilage degradation and OA progression using two murine OA models, including
naturally occurring OA in aged mice and injury-induced post-traumatic OA in the destabilization of the medial
meniscus (DMM) model. Next, we will determine if decorin increases the retention of aggrecan fragments in
degenerative cartilage, and if decorin also directly impacts chondrocyte catabolism in response to inflammatory
factors. A number of innovative approaches will be utilized. Using cartilage-specific decorin inducible knockout
mice, we will delineate decorin activities during normal cartilage homeostasis and those during the progression
of OA. Applying atomic force microscopy (AFM)-nanomechanical tests, we will quantify the mechanical
changes of cartilage as a result of decorin deficiency. By combining these approaches, we will elucidate the
roles of decorin in regulating the structure and function of normal cartilage, and the degradation of cartilage
during OA onset and progression. Successful completion of this study will establish a new structure-mechanics
principle of decorin-mediated aggrecan network assembly in the cartilage ECM. This will direct our future
studies to improve cartilage regeneration and to slow down OA progression by modulating the activity and
availability of native decorin, as well as the design and delivery of decorin-biomimetic synthetic molecules."

Ameloblastoma accounts for 14% of all odontogenic tumors and African-Americans are five times more likely to
develop ameloblastoma compared to Caucasians. Despite radical surgery, 10% of ameloblastomas recur and
25% of recurrent ameloblastomas occur in the black racial group. The biological determinants of ameloblastoma
racial disparity are unclear and there are no specific biological markers to predict recurrence. Most
ameloblastomas display genetic mutations of BRAF that encodes the serine/threonine protein kinase B-Raf, an
activator of MAPK/ERK-signaling pathway. BRAF oncogenes induce the expression of key autophagic markers
that include LC3, p62 and BECLIN1. High expressions of p62, ATG7 and LC3 have been identified in all variants
of ameloblastoma and our in vivo mouse ameloblastoma tumor model displayed elevated LC3 and p62 levels.
These suggest ameloblastoma recurrence can be attributed to autophagic cell survival mechanisms of residual
invasive neoplastic odontogenic epithelium. Interplay of autophagic regulator BECNLIN1 with RUBICON [Run
domain Beclin-1-interacting and cysteine-rich domain-containing protein], a component of LC3-associated
phagocytosis (LAP) dysregulates autophagosomal maturation and endocytic trafficking to promote tumor
migration and invasiveness. Our hypothesis is that autophagy reactivates residual invasive odontogenic
epithelium by LAP-mediated entosis and recycling of bioenergetic cellular components. Our collaborative group
has a relatively large cohort of ameloblastoma tissues and have generated epithelial-derived (EP-AMCs) and
mesenchymal-derived (MS-AMCs) ameloblastoma cell lines from BRAF V600E+ multicystic/follicular
ameloblastomas. To elucidate biological mechanisms contributing to racial disparity in Black versus White racial
groups, we will determine prognostic biomarkers of ameloblastoma recurrence and assess how LC3-mediated
autophagic ‘cargo’ processing orchestrate recurrence disparity. In Aim 1 we will determine whether autophagic
proteins are pro-oncogenic adaptors associated with ameloblastoma racial disparity, aggressive phenotype and
propensity for recurrence. In Aim 2, we will assess whether residual invasive ameloblastic epithelium survive using
LAP-mediated entosis and recycling of bioenergetic cellular components. While ameloblastoma is relatively rare,
understanding the interplay of two converging cytoprotective pathways in ameloblastoma growth pattern and
recurrence has the potential to lead to new prognostic biomarkers and precision-guided therapies to alleviate
racial disparities in BRAF+ tumors like ameloblastoma."

The overall project goal is to identify key characteristics of immune responses to vaccination with attenuated
Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites (aPfSPZs) which results in sterilizing immunity. We hypothesize that this
immunity is due to cellular and humoral responses to specific to Pf antigens (Ags) that are presented during
the liver stage (LS) of infection. We propose a detailed longitudinal analysis of innate and adaptive immune
responses using cutting-edge immunological analyses, associated informatics, and systems immunology. We
will identify aSPZ vaccine-induced cellular and humoral responses that correlate with protection in malaria
naïve and malaria experienced subjects. Complementary orthogonal analytical tools and approaches will
identify relevant immune cell subsets, Ag receptor (AR) repertoires, lineages, and specificities to protective
Ags. The functional characteristics of the immune cells and products, including antibodies, that correlate with
protection will be identified and validated. This will be accomplished by: Aim 1: Identifying aSPZ vaccine
induced cellular and humoral responses that are associated with protection. Unbiased and Ag specific cellular
profiling will characterize the kinetics of protection associated responses to vaccination and CHMI. Follow-on
analyses will profile identified Ag-specific adaptive and innate cellular responses by mass cytometry (CyTOF),
multiplexed pMHC/Ag multimer staining, and multi-omic single cell sequencing to determine protection-
associated gene and protein expression signatures and functional antibody responses, which will be extended
in later aims. Aim 2: Identify protection associated T and B cell Ag receptor (AR) repertoires at key times after
vaccinations and CHMI. Natively paired and single ARs chains from T and B cells will be sequenced to
determine repertoire attributes and identify vaccine induced Pf Ag specific ARs. Cellular transcriptomic profiles
and Ag specificities will be linked by joint single cell and TCR/BCR sequence analyses. Novel AR-Ag and
antibody specificities will be identified by yeast display methods. This aim will identify T and B cell ARs and
antibody Ag specificities that are correlated with protection. Aim 3: Identifying functional characteristics of
cellular and antibody responses that confer protection. Sorted reactive T cells will be assayed by Ag-specific
CyTOF-based intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), activation-induce marker (AIM), and single-cell sequence
based multi-omics analyses. The biophysical and functional analyses of monoclonal antibodies will be used to
assess B cell roles in protection. The comprehensive project data will undergo integrated multi-factorial
bioinformatic analysis, curation and sharing using established platforms. Overall, this project will identify key
characteristics of the intricate immune responses to the complex antigenic composition of aSPZ Pf vaccination
and the effector processes that correlate with protection and provide a set of immune correlates of protective
immunity against malaria to guide vaccine development."

immunology and immunotherapy research. For metabolomics we will add to our over 20 current assays by
expanding our capabilities to measure metabolic flux, provide the capability to investigate real-time metabolism
studies using stable isotope tracers, and develop higher throughput global profiling assays to support research
in cancer biology. With well-established operation policies, Consortium users have cost-effective, reliable, and
immediate access to the P&MSR. The research supported by the P&MSR demonstrates that it is an important
part of the critical Shared Resources infrastructure needed to support the Fred Hutch/University of Washington
Cancer Consortium."

The Comparative Medicine Shared Resource (CMSR), located at the Fred Hutch (FH), provides high quality
support for preclinical research performed by Consortium investigators. It achieves this through specialized
support structures, technology, and personnel expertise. CMSR maintains an AAALAC-accredited, USDA-
registered, and PHS-assured facility. CMSR is staffed by three clinical veterinarians with expertise in laboratory
animal medicine, animal-use regulations, and facility management and husbandry. An additional 45 personnel
provide daily care and treatment to five species of animals currently housed at FH – mice, rats, dogs, fish, and
guinea pigs – and deliver exceptional husbandry to maintain microbiologic and environmental control of animal
colonies. This care encompasses the needs of many specialized animal models of cancer and cancer-related
disease states such as transplanted or induced liquid and solid tumors, cancer-related pathogens, graft-
versus-host disease, and conditions and treatments related to radiation therapy. The small animal facility is a
centralized barrier facility with special areas to accommodate radioactive agents and infectious agents. CMSR
specialty services include patient-derived-xenograft (PDX) models and preclinical imaging support in
collaboration with the Translational BioImaging Core Shared Resource (TBICSR). A full time veterinary
comparative pathologist is available for consultation and collaboration with researchers. Equipment support for
CMSR includes individually ventilated micro-isolator rodent cages, a full service rodent cage wash and
autoclaves, and numerous surgical-ready procedure rooms for rodent users. Canine support includes
specialized housing for Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (SCID) and Pyruvate Kinase (PK) deficient
animals, a comprehensive surgical suite and procedure area, and a Linear Accelerator dedicated to preclinical
research. CMSR supplies an invaluable, centralized resource to support high quality preclinical studies.
Historically, animal models contributed to Nobel Prize winning research in bone marrow transplantation and
hematopoietic cancers. The continued expansion of scope and volume of animal-related work now includes
solid tumor and cancer-related pathogen research."

 2. at the visit level, such as tumor type and stage information
 3. at the biospecimen level, such as aliquot stabilization time
 • Procurement of research-only biospecimens, including blood draws obtained specifically for research
 and research-only biopsies
 • Retrospective identification of clinical samples that pre-exist in the hospital laboratories and which may
 be used/subdivided for research (e.g., archival pathology blocks and slides as well as remnant blood
 “leftover” in the laboratory medicine department from earlier clinical draws);
 • Detailed annotation information including extensive extraction of medical records data as needed
 • Generation of tissue microarrays as well as digital pathology image annotation and analysis of whole
 slide images
 • Dissemination of biospecimen and annotation information through informatics efforts
NWBioSR is a heavily-utilized facility, supporting a large number of clinical trials, translational research studies,

10756539,"PROJECT SUMMARY: THERAPEUTIC MANUFACTURING SHARED RESOURCE (TMSR)
The Fred Hutch/University of Washington Cancer Consortium, a world leader in the detection, diagnosis, and
prevention of cancer, has built a state-of-the-art clinical manufacturing center of excellence within the
Therapeutic Manufacturing Shared Resource (TMSR), located at Fred Hutch (FH). This resource provides
translational services that enable complex cancer research treatments to progress from the lab to the bedside.
TMSR provides clinical manufacturing services for a multitude of products for Consortium investigators that
span from traditional biologics to advanced cell and gene therapy applications. Utilizing the TMSR, Consortium
members have initiated a range of Phase I and II clinical trials that have advanced the scientific understanding
of cancer therapies. The services provided by TMSR follow current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and
include personnel that are highly trained in the field of clinical manufacturing. Additionally, the facilities and
equipment are maintained in a qualified cGMP manner and all products are subject to quality control testing
and quality assurance systems that ensure the safe manufacture and release of clinical trial materials. The
TMSR also provides project management and process development resources to both improve manufacturing
success rates and help to translate projects from faculty labs into the cGMP manufacturing facility efficiently
and effectively. Taken together, these services are critical for Consortium member who wish to quickly and
safety translate with research directly into the clinic in order to conduct Phase I and II clinical studies in a cost-
effective, compliant, and timely manner for complex cell and gene therapy modalities. The TMSR effectively
consolidates the development and production of highly complex biological and “living” cellular and gene
therapies into a single, shared resource. The TMSR ensures FDA compliance and provides regulatory support
that enables the translation of potential therapeutic products from the benchtop to the bedside thereby
providing direct impact on patient outcomes."
10756541,"PROJECT SUMMARY: TRANSLATIONAL BIOIMAGING CORE SHARED RESOURCE (TBICSR)
In vivo imaging biomarkers have become indispensable in cancer research. The Translational BioImaging Core
Shared Resource (TBICSR) provides a variety of imaging resources and support for Fred Hutch/University of
Washington Cancer Consortium research through the interdisciplinary operations of shared resources across
institutions. The goals of TBICSR are to make the widest range of high-end imaging resources available to
Consortium members in a cost effective and efficient manner. TBICSR accopmplishes this by implementing a
shared use model of imaging resources (and expertise). This is the most cost-effective way to make a wide
range of imaging resources available to Consortium members regardless of usage volume at an individual site.
Efficiency in enacting studies is enabled by allowing skilled users to access equipment via on-line scheduling
and also by providing consultation services for prospective investigators seeking advice regarding imaging
options. When consultation is requested, an imaging specialist is available to assist in Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee (IACUC) writing, arrangement of inter-institutional transportation and housing if needed,
and system scheduling. Optimization of imaging resources is further supported through faculty imaging
modality experts that engage with investigators that desire their guidance. Imaging equipment available
through TBICSR spans the range of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET),
computed tomography (CT), ultrasound (US), and optical imaging. Finally, TBICSR is supported by staff with
greater than 60 years of experience in conducting research imaging studies and in animal handling and
management. TBICSR obtained “Outstanding” ranking in the last CCSG cycle. The strengths of the resource
were and continue to be the expertise of its imaging modality leaders and the large variety of specialized major
instrumentation available to serve the imaging needs of Cancer Consortium members. In vivo imaging is an
invaluable way to non-invasively and longitudinally study the disease process and therapeutic response in
animals, which is so vital to Consortium research, prior to human studies."
10756542,"PROJECT SUMMARY: BIOSTATISTICS SHARED RESOURCE (BSR)
The Biostatistics Shared Resource (BSR) provides collaborative statistical support to Consortium members
across each of the Research Programs. We emphasize the importance of establishing ongoing and continuing
collaboration with biostatisticians as a means of maximizing scientific collaborations that lead to impactful
cancer research. The BSR aids members with projects that do not have dedicated funding for biostatistical
support. In addition, the BSR assists members across all Programs in the development of grant proposals. It is
expected that such proposals will have biostatistical support built into the budget, in which case – if a grant is
awarded – a funded collaboration with a biostatistician would subsequently take place outside the auspices of
the BSR. In this sense, the BSR frequently spawns NIH-funded research. The BSR is composed of six faculty-
level statisticians and three masters-level statisticians, and the CCSG currently funds roughly 1.1 FTE. The
level of support for each biostatistician of the BSR ranges from 5-20%, as each biostatistician is primarily
funded by research grants and contracts independent of their BSR activities. The CCSG-supported effort
ensures that a stable staff of highly skilled biostatisticians is available to Consortium investigators. The
members of the BSR have many years of experience working collaboratively with clinical, population, and
laboratory scientists and possess a wide range of expertise in statistical methods that are relevant to the
Consortium, including clinical trial design (Phase I through Phase III), survival analysis (including competing
risks), longitudinal data, diagnostics testing, biomarkers, prediction models, microbiome, genomic, proteomic,
metabolomic, high-dimensional data analysis, multi-omic and data-integration methods, analysis of nonlinear
time series including modeling and inference with ordinary differential equations, cancer survivorship, inverse-
probability weighting, statistical genetics, biological pathway analysis, mixed model and kernel methods,
quantile regression, and causal inference."

customized programming, and application of new technologies; (5) educating and training Consortium faculty
and staff on data capture, programming, data science, and interviewing techniques; and (6) providing
infrastructure support to maintain programmatic functions – for example, design of biospecimen repositories,
call center management, and database maintenance. CDSSR supports multiple studies that are recruiting
participants, capturing data, surveying study participants, designing and managing biospecimen repositories,
and implementing funded research studies. Since 2015, CDSSR has supported 232 projects from 66
Consortium members across all 8 Consortium research programs; increased its client base by an average of
63% over 4 years (FY 2015-FY 2018); supported the publication of over 60 manuscripts; held over 40 training
classes in electronic data capture technologies and scientific programming; and increased cost-effectiveness
and efficiency of multiple studies. Priority is given to Consortium faculty with peer-reviewed projects and junior
faculty seeking peer-reviewed funding. The resource continues to expand upon its technical, collaborative, and
administrative expertise, by providing access to current technologies adapted for research use and expanding
its client base."
10756545,"PROJECT SUMMARY: PREVENTION CENTER SHARED RESOURCE (PCSR)
The goal of the Prevention Center Shared Resource (PCSR) is to facilitate transdisciplinary, collaborative
research within the Consortium, focused on better understanding the contributions of behavior/lifestyle
modification, nutrition, physical activity, and obesity to cancer development, prognosis, and survivorship.
Centrally located at Fred Hutch (FH), the PCSR accomplishes this by providing Consortium investigators
access to well-trained staff and a full-service research facility (over 10,000 nsf) that contains a Research Clinic
(RC), Exercise Research Center (ERC), and Human Nutrition Lab (HNL). The RC is staffed with medical
personnel who can perform clinical assessments, collect biospecimens (including various biopsies), and obtain
detailed anthropometry. The ERC conducts exercise training and testing, including VO2 max, spirometry, and
indirect calorimetry. Trained exercise physiologists are available to help investigators design tailored exercise
programs and to oversee exercise sessions for study participants. The HNL provides comprehensive support
for the conduct of human feeding studies as well as the food component of behavioral and community nutrition
intervention studies. Services include study diet design, food production and delivery, meal service, data
collection, and study participant management and monitoring according to diet intake protocols. The PCSR
also provides training and certification for technical staff and serves as a support resource and training facility
for investigators, post-doctoral and clinical fellows, and students interested in exercise science and nutrition
research.
Given the increasing number of individuals in the US affected by cancer, it is of great importance to identify
causes of cancer that are preventable and ways to improve the quality of life among cancer survivors. The
long-term goal of the PCSR is to maintain itself as a unique, cutting-edge resource for the Consortium, to
facilitate advances in our knowledge of the behavioral/lifestyle, nutritional, physical activity, and obesity-related
contributors to cancer development, prognosis, and survivorship."

10756551,"PROJECT SUMMARY: PATHOGEN ASSOCIATED MALIGNANCIES (PAM)
The overall focus of this program is to study pathogen-associated malignancies (PAM) to better prevent,
diagnose, and treat these cancers. We will place an emphasis on studying host-pathogen interactions to
identify novel vulnerabilities caused by the pathogens and will use this information to design prevention or
treatment strategies. We will focus on anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers caused by human
papillomaviruses (HPV), Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) caused by Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV), gastric
cancers caused by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), Kaposi sarcoma and other lymphomas caused by Kaposi
sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV), liver cancers caused by hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV, HCV), and both
lymphomas and epithelial cancers caused by Epstein Barr virus (EBV). Additionally, we will study the role that
specific bacteria or the microbiome play in promoting cancer and in modifying response to treatment
modalities. The specific aims of the program are (1) to study host-pathogen interactions of PAMs to identify
mechanisms of cancer induction and exploitable vulnerabilities, (2) to support translational studies of PAMs in
preclinical and clinical settings that can inform the design of better prevention or therapeutic strategies, and (3)
to implement effective public health measures to eliminate PAMs and adapt the advances in cancer research

Over the past decade, immunotherapy has emerged as an established modality that is revolutionizing the 
treatment of many cancers. The Cancer Immunology (CI) Research Program has focused on genetically 
manipulating T cells, applying new principles of synthetic biology, and combining engineered T cells with small 
molecules and antibodies to broaden the applications and improve the safety and efficacy of adoptive 
immunotherapy. Despite the success achieved with immunologic approaches in treating some malignancies, 
major gaps exist in our current understanding of the complex relationship between progressing tumors and 
host immunity, and these must be understood and overcome to achieve the potential of immunotherapy in 
many common cancers. The CI program will focus on systematically tackling these barriers to eradicating 
tumors using a variety of immunotherapeutic modalitie alone and in combination. The specific aims of CI are 
(1) to develop effective and safe cellular immunotherapies for adult and pediatric hematologic malignancies 
and solid tumors, (2) to identify and overcome the barriers to immune-mediated tumor eradication using clinical 
specimens and preclinical models, (3) to translate discoveries in basic immunology and synthetic biology to 
novel clinical applications in cancer immunotherapy.

10756559,"PROJECT SUMMARY: BIOSTATISTICS & COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY (BCB)
Quantitative and data sciences have penetrated nearly all aspects of biomedical research. With that comes
challenges and opportunities to develop the methods needed to make valid and efficient use of these data for
inference on human health and medicine. The Biostatistics & Computational Biology (BCB) Program provides
the intellectual environment for advancing these efforts.
Our research program portfolio spans a broad range of activities from statistical methods development to
biological research that uses experimental studies in conjunction with computational methods. Our statistical
research emphasizes analytic approaches to genome-scale data sets, molecular diagnostics, development and
applications of objective measures of lifestyle and environmental exposures, and methods for clinical trials.
Highlights include breakthroughs in prostate and colorectal cancer screening analysis, new methods for design
and analysis of therapeutic trials, and the development of new statistical approaches for precision medicine
and biomarker discovery. Biological research is concentrated on cancer-relevant aspects of quantitative
immune profiling, infectious disease/microbiome, and basic molecular biology. BCB members have identified
new therapeutic avenues for treatment of leukemias and novel predictive markers of immunotherapy response.
Our research is characterized by a productive interplay between applied work and methods development.
Our specific aims are to develop rigorous statistical and mathematical methods relevant to predictive and
personalized medicine; to develop and use experimental, technological, and companion computational or
mathematical methods to gain understanding of the natural history of cancer, and to develop and disseminate
statistical and computational methods in cancer research.
A substantial portion of our research is in areas of emphasis such as high-dimensional data analysis, immune
profiling, mobile device data, and machine learning that were not a major focus 5 years ago. The ongoing
growth and development of high-throughput technologies for acquiring biological data provides great
opportunities and challenges for statisticians and computational researchers to make impactful contributions in
cancer research. BCB members are well-positioned to capitalize on these exciting opportunities: we have a
wide range of quantitative methodological training augmented by cancer-relevant domain knowledge; we have
outstanding collaborations; we are strongly committed to translating our methods research into new diagnostic
tools and therapies; and we are attentive to emerging opportunities in biomedical data science."
10880264,"Project Summary
The opportunistic fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus presents a major health concern in immunodeficient
and critically ill patients, with invasive disease contributing to high mortality rates. Infection with A. fumigatus
elicits a diverse adaptive CD4 T cell response. Our preliminary data have demonstrated distinct TH1 and TH17
spatial neighborhoods within mediastinal lymph nodes (LNs) during A. fumigatus airway infection. This spatial
organization positions activated CD4 T cells to receive tailored signals (e.g., antigens, cytokines) for optimal
effector cell differentiation and function. Lymph node stromal cells (LNSCs) are known to provide guidance cues
for immune cell trafficking during monotypic effector T cell responses. However, the mechanisms by which
distinct TH1 and TH17 microenvironments are concurrently established within LNs remain unknown. Defining
these mechanisms will offer insights into the functional importance of LN microenvironments in establishing
human immunity to infection and inflammatory disorders for the identification of novel therapeutic strategies.
Based upon our single-cell RNA-sequencing and flow cytometric analyses of FRC and effector T cell subsets
during A. fumigatus challenge, we propose that (i) FRC subsets establish spatially distinct TH1 and TH17
neighborhoods by dynamically regulating chemotactic receptor-ligand axes, such as
CXCR3:CXCL9/CXCL10 and CCR6:CCL20 and that ii) these neighborhoods can persist after pathogen
clearance. We will address these hypotheses in a clinically relevant murine model of invasive pulmonary
aspergillosis. In Specific Aim 1, we will characterize distinct spatiotemporal microenvironments formed by CD4
T cells and FRCs in A. fumigatus infection by applying spatial transcriptomic profiling followed by high-content
immunofluorescence methods paired with a novel computational approach for image analysis. In Specific Aim
2, we will define the functional role of CD4 T cell spatial organization in A. fumigatus infection by perturbing FRC-
dependent chemokine gradients in a cell type-dependent manner using FRC-specific gene targeting. We will
also conduct adoptive co-transfers of A. fumigatus-specific CD4 T cells sufficient and deficient in CXCR3 and
CCR6. In Specific Aim 3, we will investigate the durability of infection-driven spatial FRC diversity by studying
epigenetic modifications in A. fumigatus-experienced FRCs. We will also employ high-content confocal imaging
to determine whether prior infections affect FRC formation of T cell neighborhoods in subsequent infections. This
study employs and develops novel genetic tools, microscopy methods, and computational approaches to
generate a systems level understanding of secondary lymphoid organ immunobiology. Furthermore, this
proposal is tailored for a physician-scientist in training as it investigates the mechanisms by which stromal cells
induce adaptive immunity to the clinically relevant pathogen A. fumigatus, with implications for anti-fungal
therapeutic strategies and vaccine development."
10751027,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Alongside the unabating global obesity crisis, there has been a rise in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
(NAFLD), now affecting as many as ~1-in-3 Americans. While fatty liver has its own impact on liver function, a
greater risk to liver health is its potential to develop into nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), hepatic cirrhosis
and/or hepatocellular carcinoma. There are currently no medications approved to treat NAFLD. Moreover,
complications of NASH such as hepatic insulin resistance manifest long before liver failure, and NAFLD is
present in ~70% of type 2 diabetics. The mechanisms by which NAFLD develops are not well defined, but chronic
nutrient excess is implicated. Indeed, mice fed high fat/sugar diets replicates many NAFLD pathologies. In
particular, so called “Western” diets high in saturated fatty acids (SFA) induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress
in the liver, as well as activation & accumulation of hepatic myeloid cells (MCs). These MCs are key drivers of
NAFLD, as grossly depleting them reduces disease severity in mice. Our lab showed excess dietary SFAs
activate the ER sensor IRE1alpha (IRE1a) in MCs, and that this is necessary for SFAs to activate the NLRP3-
inflammasome. This is important given that the NLRP3 inflammasome, a key inflammatory apparatus that
produces IL-1beta, is an ongoing target for amelioration of obesity-associated metabolic diseases. Moreover, we
found SFAs activate IRE1a via their flux into cellular phospholipids, suggesting IRE1a not only senses unfolded
proteins (canonical ER stress), but also ER membrane saturation. Thus, it is remarkable the potentially important
role of MC-specific IRE1a in the pathogenesis of NAFLD & NASH remains largely unexplored. We hypothesize
that, in the context of nutrient excess, MC-specific IRE1a mediates activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome within
the liver in a manner essential for the progression of NAFLD. We propose to test this hypothesis, including the
extent to which MC-specific IRE1a can be targeted to reverse established NASH, using highly innovative &
specific new mouse models. We also aim to define the specific structural domain of IRE1a required for MCs to
activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and stimulate consequent IL-1beta secretion in response to SFA excess.
The proposal will be carried out at UCSF, a world leader in pioneering biomedical research to improve healthcare

10751028,"Project Summary / Abstract
Spinal cord injury (SCI) often disrupts corticospinal drive, resulting in weak voluntary activation of muscles and
impaired motor control. Thus, an intervention that further improves corticospinal function could enhance motor
recovery. However, such neuromodulatory interventions are not currently available to people with incomplete
SCI. For example, other than conventional physical therapy, the most common treatment for foot drop (weak
ankle dorsiflexion), which often impairs gait in this population, is an ankle foot orthosis. These standard
treatments do not aim to restore corticospinal drive and may even depress it further. Operant conditioning of a
stimulus-triggered EMG response, which can target beneficial plasticity to the pathway that produces the
response may be able to fill this gap. The overarching hypothesis of this project is that increasing the size of
the motor evoked potential (MEP) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation through operant
conditioning can improve corticospinal activation of the targeted muscle and thereby improve motor
function in which that muscle participates.
In people with incomplete SCI, the tibialis anterior (TA) MEP is often small, reflecting reduced corticospinal
excitability. This weakened corticospinal activation of TA contributes to foot drop, which further impairs their gait
through a chain of compensation and maladaptation at knee and hip. Thus, a therapy that increases corticospinal
excitability for TA may reduce foot drop and other associated problems, and thereby improve walking. Recent
small studies of TA MEP conditioning suggest that MEP up-conditioning can increase the corticospinal
excitability for TA and can improve gait in people with chronic SCI. Building upon those initial findings, this project
seeks to characterize the physiological mechanisms and effects of TA MEP conditioning.
Individuals with weak dorsiflexion due to chronic incomplete SCI are exposed to 42 1-hr MEP sessions (6
baseline followed by 36 up-conditioning or 36 control sessions). Before baseline and after 12, 24, 36 conditioning
(or control) sessions, (1) to characterize the cortical and corticospinal mechanisms of the TA MEP changes
produced by MEP up-conditioning, cortical MEP map, MEP recruitment curve, short-interval cortical inhibition,
cervicomedullary MEP, H-reflex, and F-wave are measured; and (2) to characterize the impact of TA MEP up-
conditioning on locomotor function, bilateral locomotor EMG and kinematics measurements, 10-m and 6-min
walking tests, and locomotor reflex testing are performed.
Determining how MEP conditioning induces cortical and corticospinal plasticity and how such plasticity changes
locomotion in people with incomplete SCI will illuminate the dynamic process of inducing and shaping
functionally-relevant CNS multi-site plasticity through guiding targeted plasticity. The results will help to navigate
development and clinical translation of MEP operant conditioning, as a novel non-invasive therapy that may
complement other therapies and further enhance recovery in people with SCI or other disorders."

10824297,"Anti-VEGF therapies, standard care in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nvAMD), improve
outcomes in less than 50% of patients and do not prevent vision-loss progression due to fibrosis or macular
atrophy. We used human physiologically relevant models to gain understanding into the coordination of
signaling pathways and cross-talk involved in the activation of choroidal endothelial cells (CECs) to migrate
and form macular neovascularization in nvAMD. The scaffolding protein, IQGAP1, sustains activation of the
GTPase Rac1, which is necessary for CEC migration. Rac1 is activated by AMD-related stresses involving
inflammatory, oxidative and angiogenic factors, as well as by the oxysterol, 7-ketocholesterol (7KC), which
accumulates in blood and Bruch’s membrane with increased age and in AMD. 7KC causes CECs to change
expression of cell markers from endothelial to mesenchymal ones, suggesting endothelial-mesenchymal
transition (EndMT). IQGAP1 appears involved. 7KC also causes fibrosis in models of laser induced injury. Our
data support the hypothetical framework that will be tested in the next funding period: that (1) IQGAP1 is
critical to EndMT induced by the oxysterol 7KC; and that (2) 7KC triggers transcriptional events that render
CECs unable to maintain expression of endothelial markers but to develop into a new phenotype of migratory,
mesenchymal cells that develop into fibrosis. We will also test two potential therapies to reduce fibrosis: (a) to
inhibit TGFβ signaling in combination with anti-VEGF and (b) to target phosphorylation of IQGAP1 in a novel
mutant IQGAP1 mouse that we created by CRISPR-Cas9-induced gene mutation. Specific Aim 1 is to test the
prediction that IQGAP1 mediates EndMT-induced migration in CECs exposed to 7KC. Specific Aim 2 is to test
the prediction that 7KC, mediated through IQGAP1, decreases the proportion of labeled endothelial positive to
mesenchymal positive cells after laser in endothelial specific yellow-fluorescent protein reporter mice. Specific
Aim 3 is to test predictions that increased age, TGFβ-signaling, or IQGAP1 serine phosphorylation will
increase αSMA-labeled lesions after laser in 7KC-treated eyes and to test strategies as possible future
treatments. We will also evaluate the involvement of Müller cells, pericyes, and RPE. Tools include isolated
human CECs; high throughput RNA sequencing; flow cytometry; spectral domain optical coherence
tomography (sdOCT); 7KC-induced models of EndMT and fibrosis; yellow-fluorescent protein endothelial
reporter mice; conditional inducible endothelial Iqgap1 knockout mice; a mutant IQGAP1 mouse through
CRISPR-Cas9-technology; intravitreal injections of pharmacologic agents; Micron IV laser induced injury to test
7KC-induced EndMT and lesion formation. These studies will test the role of IQGAP1 in 7KC-induced EndMT
as a potential cause of fibrosis, which is poorly responsive to anti-VEGF in nvAMD, and will test two novel
treatments to reduce nvAMD and EndMT."
10872230,"PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT)
Postpartum depression (PPD) affects 28 million mothers worldwide in the first year after birth, risking suicide—
a leading cause of maternal death globally—and placing children at risk for future mental health problems.
Cesarean delivery (CD) is the most common major abdominal surgery in the world, and a lack of data on new
pain treatments in pregnancy and lactation puts 1.2 million US women every year after CD at risk for poor pain
control, depressed mood, and poor recovery. Despite high individual variability in pain after CD, current CD
treatments ignore the multidimensionality of pain. NMDA receptor antagonists like ketamine are known to
reduce postoperative pain and opioid use in non-obstetric surgical populations, and recently, ketamine has
been recognized for its utility in treating depression. Although limited-use postpartum ketamine studies show
no evidence of serious negative effects, ketamine has known and undesirable side effects (e.g., nausea,
dysphoria) which can interfere with newborn care. Studies on pregnant/lactating women are limited by lack of
data on optimal dose and long-term PPD and pain recovery outcomes. This knowledge gap precludes
understanding how ketamine might reduce PPD and pain in this population. There is a critical need for better
treatments to reduce PPD risk and pain after CD. To address these needs, we will identify ketamine’s tolerable
dose, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics after CD so that future randomized trials using appropriately
dosed ketamine in postpartum women can be conducted. Our long-term goal is to reduce the burden and
impact of depression and pain in special populations. Our central hypothesis is that post-CD ketamine reduces
PPD risk by reducing pain in multiple dimensions. Specific Aims: A1: Quantify tolerable dose of postpartum
ketamine using MTD design. A2: Identify PK/PD of postpartum ketamine infusion in an open-label
observational study. A3: Identify change points/trajectories of PPD symptoms to inform future postpartum
ketamine trial outcomes. This proposal has the potential to change practice because preventive therapies for
PPD are lacking, and the dearth of alternative non-opioid analgesia after CD has been a critical barrier to
progress in postpartum pain recovery. Our approach is innovative because it employs novel theoretical
concepts to postpartum multimodal pain management strategies. It addresses gaps in prior studies that used
best-guess doses of ketamine, leading to variable results on efficacy and side effects. This work will identify
new therapeutic strategies that reduce both PPD risk and postpartum pain. It will directly inform the next steps
for a randomized trial on post-CD ketamine at a tolerable dose, for PPD and pain recovery outcomes."
10876413,"There has been an unprecedented mental health crisis and a surge in suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs)
among youth that predated and was further exacerbated by the pandemic. Studies show that youth are at
increased risk for incident treatment for psychiatric diagnosis 1-6 months following COVID-19 infection. Risk for
STBs is also increased among individuals with infections; and cognitive impairment following COVID-19 is
reported even ~4 months following infection. In addition to the increased morbidity and mortality, the mitigation
efforts put in place to reduce transmission resulted in additional stressors on children and families (e.g., parental
job loss, parental death, online schooling) and these were associated with increased rates of psychopathology
in youth. However, we have a limited understanding of the unique contribution of COVID-19 infection on
incidence of psychopathology in youth and the biological mechanisms implicated in risk. Dysregulations in
immune responses, specifically, increased IL-6, IL-1b, C-Reactive Protein (CRP), and TNF-a and their mRNA
and low cortisol are common biological mechanisms implicated in COVID-19 severity and in psychopathology.
Our goals are to examine the impact of COVID-19 infection on incidence of psychopathology in youth; its impact
on inflammation and HPA axis markers; and to identify clinical, cognitive, biological, and psychosocial
characteristics that will help predict youth at risk for onset of psychopathology following COVID-19 infection. We
propose to recruit youth, aged 12-17 years, without history of psychiatric disorders or chronic Illness or chronic
infections who were: 1) infected with COVID-19 within the past month (COVID, n=200); 2) without history of
COVID-19, influenza (IFV), or any respiratory infections in the past 6 months (no-COVID, n=200); and 3) youth
with IFV within the past month (IFV, n=100). The IFV group will allow us to examine whether COVID-19 or
infections in general are associated with risk. Participants will be followed at 3, 6, and 18 months after baseline
and assessed on psychiatric and physical symptoms, cognitive function, incident psychopathology; pandemic
and non-pandemic stressors; and risk and protective factors at all timepoints. At baseline, 3, and 6 months, we
will measure inflammation (cytokines, mRNA for inflammatory genes); and collect acute and chronic HPA axis
activity measures (hair cortisol concentrations, salivary cortisol). We hypothesize that the COVID group will show
increased risk of onset of psychopathology, specifically depression and anxiety disorders and STBs, compared
to the no-COVID and IVF groups. They will also show increased inflammation and psychiatric and physical
symptoms over time; and reduced HPA axis activity and cognitive function over time; and these will in turn predict
onset of psychopathology. This study will advance our understanding of the impact of COVID-19 infection on
risk for psychopathology in youth and the biological mechanisms implicated in risk. The results will also extend
to other types of infections. This study is essential to inform our preparedness efforts for future epidemics and
pandemics, which are inevitable and on the rise."
10750308,"Project Summary
 The objective of this proposal is to make the chronic injured brain receptive to cognitive rehabilitation. After
traumatic brain injury (TBI), there is synaptic deafferentation followed by responsive neuroplastic change in
surviving synaptic terminals. Without intervention after TBI, the natural disease course involves uncoordinated
regenerative responses and maladaptive circuit formation. The degenerative and regenerative cellular processes
alter circuit structure and manifest in neurological dysfunction, including cognitive deficits. Veterans with a history
of TBI report memory and cognition challenges that impair their activities of daily living. Laboratory evidence
from the research team shows persistent short-term, long-term, and sequential memory impairments for months
after experimental TBI. Further, when a novel spatial navigation rehabilitation strategy – Peg Forest rehabilitation
– is provided at one week post-injury, cognitive impairments are not detectable in brain-injured rats. Therapeutic
efficacy is evident in brain-injured male and female rats only when a novel spatial arrangement of pegs is
provided each day, rather than repeated presentation of the same arrangement. However, Peg Forest
rehabilitation is no longer effective when initiated at one month post-injury, once cognitive impairments have
manifested and injury-related neuroplasticity has waned. A new approach is required to make the chronic injured
brain receptive to rehabilitation.
 Until recently, relatively few (if any) compounds were known to possess neuroplastic-promoting properties.
A group of compounds known as psychoplastogens have recently gained widespread attention for their ability to
ameliorate depression, anxiety, PTSD and other congenital and chronic mental health disorders for months up
to a year with a single administration. The underlying benefits are attributed to increased dendritic arborization
and spine density in cortical regions and hippocampus, which can promote new neural pathways. New
preliminary data replicate the inefficacy of Peg Forest rehabilitation alone in the chronic period of TBI and the
significant improvement in sequential memory with a single dose of ketamine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) preceding Peg
Forest rehabilitation (15 min/day; 5 days/week for 2 weeks). The aims of this proposal are built on the premise
that the reintroduction of a neuroplastic state by the psychoplastogens ketamine and psilocybin preceding Peg
Forest cognitive rehabilitation can rescue cognitive function.
 In the context of TBI associated cognitive impairments, we hypothesize that psychoplastogen administration
preceding dynamic spatial navigation cognitive rehabilitation in the Peg Forest can rescue cognitive function in
the chronic TBI period, as a neuroplastic state has been induced. Diffuse TBI by midline fluid percussion results
in novel object cognitive impairments in male and female rats. In Aim 1, the lowest doses are determined for
each sex for the psychoplastogens ketamine and psilocybin that increase dendritic arborization and spine density
over saline control, with minimal behavioral manifestations of hallucinogenic or dissociative effects, as reported
for people. In Aim 2, therapeutic efficacy of psychoplastogen treatment preceding cognitive rehabilitation is
determined in both sexes for cognitive performance assessed by novel object tasks and the Y-maze. In Aim 3,
the induction of a neuroplastic state is quantified through dendritic arborization, spine density, synapse number,
and serotonin receptor levels, since psychoplastogens have mechanisms to elevate serotonin receptors,
synapse number, and circuit structure. Results of this proposal advance basic psychoplastogen pharmacology,
demonstrate therapeutic efficacy along with cognitive rehabilitation, and explore structural brain changes in
neurons, synapses, and receptors. For the first time, a therapeutic pathway exists to overcome persistent
neurological symptoms in the chronic injured brain."
11006246,"ABSTRACT
Protein replacement therapy has been a cornerstone in treating genetic diseases (e.g., hemophilia) with loss or
reduction of the function of a particular protein, by using recombinant proteins or recombinant engineered
proteins. However, most protein therapeutics have short circulation lives, and thus require frequent invasive
infusion to maintain their therapeutic efficacy. For example, the most common treatment for hemophilia A caused
by a deficiency of blood clotting factor VIII (FVIII) is factor concentrate replacement, which is associated with
burdensome frequent intravenous infusion. To address the unmet medical need of hemophilia, the major
objective of this project is to develop a non-invasive oral mRNA delivery nanoplatform for durable protein
replacement therapy requiring infrequent dosing. Synthetic mRNA has shown enormous potential for biomedical
applications, with mRNA vaccines already clinically approved for COVID-19. Various delivery strategies have
been developed to improve mRNA translation; however, an ongoing challenge of mRNA therapy is managing
the transient efficacy due to its relatively short half-life, and oral mRNA delivery remains elusive. In my previous
work, I have identified a unique poly(zwitterion)-lipid-based micelle platform that can cross the intestinal epithelial
barrier and lead to a very potent oral bioavailability of biomolecules such as insulin. Recently, I have also
discovered a new type of ionizable lipids that can extend the duration of mRNA-mediated protein expression. In
this F32 project, I propose to combine the epithelium-crossing poly(zwitterion)-lipids and the unique ionizable
lipids to develop an innovative mRNA delivery platform for oral, durable replacement therapy of bleeding
disorders. In Aim 1, I will synthesize new poly(zwitterion)-lipids and ionizable lipids and generate a series of new
mRNA lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), and systematically investigate their effects on oral transcytosis and the
durability of protein expression in vitro and in vivo. In Aim 2, we will select the top-performing LNPs for oral
delivery of FVIII mRNA and evaluate the FVIII mRNA nanotherapy in healthy and hemophilia mouse models.
With the successful completion of this project, we expect that the oral durable mRNA delivery strategy will provide
a more effective and robust therapy for hemophilia and other bleeding disorders."
10750662,"Background: Despite the proven efficacy and safety of statins, nearly 250,000 Veterans at high-risk for
cardiovascular disease (CVD) seen annually in primary care are not taking them leading to higher cholesterol
levels, cardiovascular risk, and health care costs. Primary care providers and health systems have a critical
and unmet need for pragmatic, scalable interventions to address gaps in their patients’ perceptions of the risks
and benefits of statin therapy to improve appropriate statin utilization and to lower CVD risk. Important prior
work by our group demonstrates that pharmacogenomic testing for statin toxicity is feasible, improves patients’
perceptions of statin therapy, leads to a doubling in appropriate statin prescribing, and lowers cholesterol
levels. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that disclosure of statin pharmacogenomic test results for
statin efficacy/toxicity and CVD risk to patients at high-risk for CVD will improve their perceptions of their CVD
risk and statins risks/benefits and, in turn, the proportion of Veterans accepting and adhering to statin therapy
to achieve a clinically significant low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) reduction.
Significance: By using a feasible and inexpensive approach of pharmacogenomic testing for common genetic
variants reporting on statin efficacy and toxicity and CVD risk, the work is significant as it will lead to more
patients at high-risk for CVD accepting and adhering to statins. This work addresses HSR&D research
priorities of quality and safety of health care and health care value, ORD priorities of increasing substantial
real-world impact of VA research, and VHA quality measures around statin prescribing and controlling
cholesterol levels in patients at high-risk for CVD.
Innovation and Impact: This proposal uses an innovative approach of pharmacogenomic testing to address
patients’ perceptions of the risks and benefits of statin therapy and their risk of CVD which are known barriers
to statin acceptance and adherence. We expect a positive impact on reducing CVD risk in Veterans.
Specific Aims:
1: Reduce cholesterol levels through a precision medicine approach of statin pharmacogenomic testing.
2: Improve acceptance of guideline-directed statin therapy through delivery of statin pharmacogenomic test
results that communicates statin efficacy and toxicity.
3: Identify contextual and economic factors salient for implementing statin pharmacogenomic testing.
Methodology: A randomized controlled trial focused on effectiveness while secondarily gathering
implementation data will enroll 408 primary care patients who are at high-risk for CVD and recommended for
statins based on guidelines but not prescribed them. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to intervention
(guideline-based statin recommendations - “guidelines” - plus statin pharmacogenomic test results) vs. control
(guidelines) stratified by prior statin use. The primary outcome is change in 12-month LDL. Secondary
outcomes are new statin prescriptions and patients’ perceptions of risks and benefits of statins. Exploratory
analyses will assess statin prescriptions and fills as potential mediators of the intervention. Qualitative data
from trial participants and their providers will illuminate key factors to consider for future implementation. If
effective, the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of the intervention on LDL during the trial period projected
over 10-year and lifetime CVD risk horizons will be measured.
Next steps/Implementation: An embedded primary care, patient-powered caucus and a VA operational
stakeholder board representing primary care, cardiology, pharmacy, and the VA Pharmacogenomics Testing
for Veterans (PHASER) clinical program will work with the investigative team to create an implementation
“blueprint” package consisting of patient/provider educational portfolios, electronic medical record tools,
Corporate Data Warehouse queries, and laboratory protocols for dissemination to Veterans and VHA facilities."
10922723,"ABSTRACT
To date there is no effective treatment for Alzheimer’s disease that decreases cognitive decline. Although the
available drugs are effective at reducing amyloid beta, a multi-target drug approach is more likely to succeed in
impacting cognitive function. One potentially complementary treatment approach is modulation of the autophagic
lysosomal pathway (ALP), which is responsible for protein turnover and has been shown to regulate degradation
of misfolded proteins in the CNS. Autophagy activation normally helps clear protein aggregates and damaged
organelles via sequestration into autophagosomes, these vesicles eventually fuse with lysosomes, which then
degrade the autophagic cargo. This pathway is more complicated in long-lived, polarized neurons, where
autophagy largely initiates in the distal axon and thus autophagic lysosomal intermediates must be removed
from the axon via retrograde transport to the soma where proteolytically active lysosomes reside. Disruptions in
the transport or maturation of ALP intermediates has long been implicated in AD pathogenesis, as they buildup
in dystrophic neurites around Aβ aggregates and likely contribute to Aβ production in AD. Preliminary data in our
AD model of iPSC-derived human i3Neurons shows that ALP intermediates that accumulate in axonal swellings
are cleared upon treatment with a novel compound identified in a high throughput screen as an autophagy
upregulator in Hela cells. Importantly, our data shows that this compound also reduces both intracellular and
extracellular Aβ42 and increases neuronal autophagy (increased LC3II/LC3I) in our AD model i3Neurons.
Exciting new data from the Aldrich lab has identified lysosomal membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) as a direct target
of the compound. Given these preliminary studies, we hypothesize that the novel compound, through direct
interaction with LAMP1 and potential stabilization of LAMP1 interactions with retrograde machinery,
increases retrograde lysosomal transport and autophagosome maturation, and thus clears axonal ALP
vesicles and ultimately lowers Aβ levels. We will test this hypothesis by determining the mechanism by which
the novel compound alters ALP transport and ALP composition and function, as well as identify new potential
targets in neurons (by an unbiased proteomics approach). Through these studies, we will also determine if the
FDA-approved drug Rapamycin can alter axonal ALP buildup or Aβ42 levels in comparison to the novel
compound, thus shedding new insight into the translational potential of both drugs. Lastly, we will determine if
the novel compound can reduce Aβ42 in a familial AD model and how it alters ALP in these neurons. Given the
strong evidence that this compound can modulate axonal ALP transport, Aβ42 and neuronal autophagy, the
results from the proposed experiments could be relevant to therapeutic approaches in other neurodegenerative
diseases that have ALP dysfunction as a contributing pathological feature, such as Parkinson’s disease,
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and frontotemporal dementia."
10912015,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Patients diagnosed with glioblastoma (GBM) have a median overall survival of less than two years even
after receiving multimodal therapies. Multiple factors account for this treatment resistance including: 1) Inability
of therapies to cross the blood-brain barrier to reach invading cells; 2) GBM’s molecular heterogeneity and
overlapping escape mechanisms that overcome targeted therapies; 3) Evasive mechanisms that render GBMs
resistant to immunotherapy. Therefore, there is an unmet need for GBM treatment approaches that address
multiple resistance mechanisms.
 The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a member of the immunoglobulin
superfamily which was discovered as a transmembrane receptor for the products of nonenzymatic glycation and
oxidation of proteins. RAGE is expressed by glioma cells and is activated by its ligands present in GBM tumor
microenvironment (TME). Activation of RAGE stimulates multiple signaling pathways that promote GBM
progression. Recently, we demonstrated that genetic ablation of intracellular RAGE in gliomas inhibited multiple
oncogenic pathways that not only regulated glioma growth and invasion, but also, improved the efficacy of
immunotherapies by promoted an immunologically “permissive” TME. We also discovered that RAGE ablation
in TME enhances the efficacy of immunotherapy. Based on these observations, we propose to evaluate RAGE
inhibition as a multifaceted therapy for GBM.
 Our central hypothesis is that RAGE inactivation will not only suppress oncogenic pathways that are
important for GBM growth and invasion, but also, enhance responses to immunotherapy. Three independent
aims are proposed. Aim 1 will determine the mechanism of RAGE ablation on enhancing the anti-tumor immune
responses in syngeneic mouse GBM models. Findings from this Aim will uncover novel strategies that could
enhance immunotherapy efficacy in these resistant tumors. Aim 2 will measure the synergistic effects of small
molecule RAGE inhibitors with immunotherapy. In this Aim, we will perform the pre-clinical studies to optimize
the dosing regimen of RAGE inhibitors for future GBM clinical trials. Finally, Aim 3 will Identify mechanisms of
immunotherapy resistance to RAGE ablation. This Aim will identify the mechanisms by which RAGE ligands
such as S100A9 attenuate tumor immune responses.
 Success of any of these aims, which are supported by compelling preliminary data, is expected to lead to the
development of novel and critically needed GBM therapies."
10893353,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) accounts for 10-15% of breast cancer, there remains much to be
learned about the unique nature of this disease. Compared to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), ILC is
understudied, with distinct histological, genomic, and clinical characteristics. Despite key differences, women
with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) ILC will most likely receive the same treatment as women with ER+ IDC
though often show inferior long-term outcomes.
Recently, the Lee-Oesterreich Lab and others have identified enrichment of ERBB2 mutations in ILC compared
to IDC. As ILC is characterized by loss of CDH1 (E-cadherin), our findings may suggest a potential interaction
between loss of CDH1 and mutations in ERBB2 in driving ILC tumor progression. As ERBB2 mutations usually
occur in the absence of ERBB2 amplification, there are currently no FDA-approved therapies targeting ERBB2
mutant ILC. Several clinical trials have reported promising efficacy of anti-HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors,
including neratinib, in patients with ERBB2 mutant ILC. However, resistance to these therapies is inevitable. In
order to identify the most effective combination therapies, the functional role of these recurrent ERBB2
mutations in ILC requires further investigation. Using a combination of clinical specimens, innovative in vitro
models and CRISPR-based genome editing, our proposal will determine the prevalence of ERBB2 mutations in
ctDNA collected from plasma samples of patients with metastatic breast cancer and investigate how these
mutations influence HER2 activation and downstream signaling pathways and sensitivity/resistance to
available anti-HER2 agents (Aim 1). We will also evaluate the effects of CDH1 knockout and re-expression on
HER2 signaling and degradation in order to understand the cooperation between loss of CDH1 and mutations
in ERBB2 in ILC and explore potential mechanisms of HER2 regulation by E-cadherin (Aim 2).
Results of this and future research will help inform clinicians and researchers of the mechanisms, clinical
relevance, and targetability of recurrent ERBB2 mutations and complement findings from ongoing clinical trials
to identify the most effective therapy combinations for patients with ERBB2 mutant ILC."
10747951,"Project Abstract
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality world-wide and in the United States;1,2
however, there are no FDA-approved medications to ameliorate the devastating consequences of secondary
injury caused by complex neuropathological cascades following the initial neuronal insult. Cathepsin B and L
represent promising drug targets, as knock-out and inhibition studies of these cysteine proteases in animal
models reveal improvement in behavioral and neurocognitive sequelae.3–7 There is a clear need for new
therapeutic options to treat secondary injury following TBI, and cathepsin B and L inhibitors have
pharmaceutical promise. Over 60% of FDA-approved drugs are derived from or inspired by natural products
(NPs).8 Cyanobacteria are known to produce NPs with a range of bioactivity, including activity as protease
inhibitors.9,10 NPs are biosynthesized by megaenzymes that are encoded as discrete genomic packages called
biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs).11 We hypothesize that a genomic approach can be used to enhance drug
discovery efforts from cyanobacteria for novel cathepsin B and L inhibitors through the three aims outlined
below. First, an innovative pharmacophore-based genome mining pipeline will be developed (Aim 1). In this
aim, pharmacophores deduced from virtual docking experiments and known cathepsin inhibitors will be used to
predict enzymatic domains responsible for the creation of the desired pharmacophore. This retrobiosynthetic
prediction will be used to make bioinformatic models to interrogate sequenced cyanobacterial genomes to find
candidate BGCs. The BGCs of highest interest will be identified, delineated, and the compounds produced
through either cultivation or heterologous expression (Aim 2). Using a full retrobiosynthetic prediction for
gallinamide A, a compound that demonstrates nanomolar cathepsin L inhibition, we will search for the BGC
within the genomic library at Scripps or in new cyanobacterial collections. Additional BGCs from Aim 1 will be
developed in this aim as well. If the BGC is not constitutively expressed or if the BGC is not associated with a
cultivatable organism, heterologous expression will be pursued (Aim 3). Compound isolation and molecular
networking to analyze and annotate the chemical space of the natural products produced will follow.
Compounds will be tested in bioassays to evaluate cathepsin B and L activity on purified enzymes as well as in
neuronal and glial cellular studies. The gap between the identified pharmaceutical need and the discovery of
novel bioactive molecules can be bridged by the innovative multidisciplinary approach presented in this
application. The proposed project will be carried out as part of an NIH F32 NRSA Fellowship at Scripps
Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego, under the co-sponsorship of Professors William Gerwick and
Vivian Hook and a team of collaborators that will train the postdoctoral fellow in virtual docking experiments,
bioinformatics, heterologous gene expression, and cathepsin-related bioassays."
10747971,"SUMMER PHYSIOLOGY UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCHER (SPUR) PROGRAM - The Department of Cellular and Integrative Physiology at the University of Texas Health San Antonio (UTHSA) has recruited undergraduates including underrepresented minorities (URMs) to apply to our Summer Physiology Undergraduate Researcher (SPUR) Program for over two decades. Through laboratory research experience, SPUR students learn to apply cutting-edge research techniques, develop scientific communication skills and learn about responsible conduct of research. These attributes build undergraduate proficiency and confidence in research. Despite increased interest in pursuing careers in biomedical sciences, URM and underprivileged students are only half as likely as non-URMs to complete Bachelors degrees and/or to become part of the biomedical research workforce. Under the proposed R25 SPUR Program, URM science undergraduates entering their junior and senior years will be actively recruited nationally and through partnerships with five minority and Hispanic-serving Institutions in San Antonio via referrals from local faculty mentors. Our partner Institutions (St. Mary's University, Trinity University, University of the Incarnate Word, Texas A&M University at San Antonio and Our Lady of the Lake University) do not offer graduate training programs in biomedical neurosciences; but have diverse student populations reflecting the ethnic (64% Hispanic, 7% Black, 3% Asian, 1% Native American) and socioeconomic diversity of San Antonio, with 50-70% being first generation undergraduates. Although these local Institutions have high percentages of URM science majors, very few pursue careers in biomedical research creating a gap in the pipeline of URM-students entering the scientific research workforce. The main objective of our R25 Program is to fill this gap by providing research experience and mentoring to encourage more URM undergraduates to use the SPUR opportunity as a launching platform for careers in biomedical sciences. R25 SPUR students will participate in laboratory research for 40 hours/week for 10 weeks. In addition, students will have lectures on fundamentals of neuroscience and neurological disorders, receive training in responsible conduct of research and learn about scientific communications. SPUR Program mentors will participate in a mentor-training workshop focused on awareness of URM barriers to success, techniques for effective mentoring and enhancing mentors’ abilities to nurture students from diverse backgrounds. At the end of the 10-week Program, students will write a final report and present their findings at a Departmental symposium. The R25 SPUR Program will be evaluated and feedback collected to make improvements in the Program, ensuring its continued success. Thus, our efforts through this summer Program will contribute to building a diverse biomedical research workforce, a core mission of the NINDS R25 Program."
10747984,"Many Medicaid expansion enrollees with incomes less than 138% of the federal poverty level (FPL) face
greater cost-sharing and higher out-of-pocket costs when they tum 65 years old and transition to Medicare. In
Medicare, there is a subsidy cliff at 100% FPL, above which beneficiaries are not eligible for comprehensive
subsidies that cover medical cost-sharing in Medicare Parts A (inpatient) and B (outpatient). Beneficiaries with
incomes between 100-150% FPL and limited assets can qualify for partial financial assistance through a
complex set of programs. Take-up of these subsidies is limited, and evidence suggests that Black and
Hispanic beneficiaries are more likely to be eligible for but less likely to be aware of subsidy programs vs.
White beneficiaries. Moreover, higher cost-sharing has been associated with reductions in necessary care and
worse outcomes, and in some cases, widening of racial/ethnic disparities in care. Sixteen states have
expanded income and asset eligibility for comprehensive cost-sharing subsidies above federal minimums, but
there is little evidence on whether such policies mitigate racial/ethnic disparities. In Aims 1 and 2, we will use
linked, individual-level Medicaid and Medicare enrollment, claims, and encounter data from 2016-2023 to
follow beneficiaries as they transition from Medicaid to Medicare at age 65 and examine whether the transition
between programs leads to disparities in the receipt of Medicare subsidies and contributes to disparities in
use, clinical event outcomes, and spending. For Aim 1, we will examine if there are racial/ethnic disparities in
Medicare coverage among Medicaid expansion beneficiaries that transition to Medicare-only and use machine
learning approaches to identify factors (e.g., policy, health care system, individual) that predict receipt of
subsidies among minority vs. White beneficiaries. For Aim 2, we will assess if increases in cost-sharing upon
entry to Medicare contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in service use (e.g., outpatient visits), clinical event
outcomes (e.g., emergency department visits, hospitalizations, mortality), and spending (out-of-pocket and
total costs). We will use a difference-in-difference approach to compare changes in outcomes for beneficiaries
just above vs. below income limits for comprehensive cost-sharing subsidies, after vs. before entering
Medicare. For Aim 3, we focus on a subset of states that expanded income or asset eligibility for Medicare
subsidies above federal minimums in 2008 or later to assess if these policy changes reduce racial/ethnic
disparities associated with Medicare cost-sharing. We will use 2006-2023 Medicare data and a difference-indifference
approach to examine changes in outcomes for beneficiaries who gain comprehensive cost-sharing
subsidies before vs. after state subsidy expansions. In all aims, we will examine whether effects differ for Black
and Hispanic vs. White beneficiaries. Findings from this study will inform coverage policies that could reduce
adverse outcomes and racial/ethnic disparities in care as beneficiaries transition across these two public
programs."
10747987,"Chronic alcohol consumption induces transcriptional changes in genes encoding structural components
and regulators of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The molecular mechanisms underlying these alterations and
the functional implications of altered ECM gene expression are not well understood in the context of excessive
alcohol drinking. We hypothesize that activation of the immune response-related transcription factor STAT3 in
astrocytes results in transcriptional changes in genes encoding ECM components, resulting in alterations in
ECM structure and function, synaptic changes, and increased ethanol intake. The proposed experiments will
address this hypothesis with three specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will use an unbiased approach to
determine changes in the cortical ECM proteome, or “matrisome” in mice that have chronically consumed
ethanol in a binge-like drinking protocol (drinking in the dark) for 6 weeks. Cutting-edge proteomics and
glycomics will be performed to quantitatively measure changes in cortical ECM. These results will be compared
to changes in ECM-related genes in existing and new INIA transcriptome datasets and the genes analyzed for
STAT3 binding motifs in their promoters. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the role of astrocyte-expressed
STAT3 in alcohol consumption by conditionally knocking out Stat3 in astrocytes using floxed Stat3 mice and
the astrocyte-specific Cre line, Aldh1l1-CreERT2. Mice will be tested for binge-like ethanol consumption and
dependence-induced escalation of ethanol intake. Association of activated STAT3 with gene promoters in the
prefrontal cortex will also be determined after chronic binge-like drinking using chromatin immunoprecipitation
with an antibody to phosphorylated STAT3, followed by whole-genome DNA sequencing (ChIP-Seq). Finally,
we will determine the role of a specific ECM gene and putative STAT3 target, brevican (Bcan) in alcohol
consumption, by conditionally knocking out Bcan in astrocytes as described above. We will also reduce the
expression of Bcan in the prefrontal cortex of mice using viral-delivered shRNA and measure binge-like ethanol
intake. Brevican is localized perisynaptically and regulates synaptic plasticity. To determine if brevican is more
highly associated with synapses after chronic ethanol drinking and if synapse structure in the PFC is altered by
chronic ethanol, we will perform super-resolution microscopy with brevican antibody and antibodies to
excitatory and inhibitory synaptic markers in mice after chronic binge-like drinking. Within each Specific Aim,
we will integrate and collaborate with INIA-Neuroimmune and INIA-Stress investigators. The completion of
these Specific Aims will contribute to fundamental knowledge of the molecular and cellular mechanisms by
which chronic alcohol drinking alters the ECM and potentially provide new cellular targets to reduce excessive
alcohol consumption."
10748279,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nutrition is at the epicenter of human health and disease. However, our current “one size fits all” approach to
clinical nutrition is failing a large segment of the population. Individual factors including genetics, metabolism,
physiology, microbiome, behavior, the built in and contextual environment all underlie the inherent variability in
response to diets. Exciting new research shows that machine learning algorithms can integrate this complex
information and predict how someone responds to a given diet. If validated, this innovative approach will
provide a radical change in the delivery of personalized nutrition prescriptions to promote health and treat
chronic diseases. The goal of the “Nutrition for Precision Health (NPH), powered by All of Us” consortium is to
generate a rich database from a diverse population to develop a first-of-its-kind diet prediction algorithm. The
aim of the Louisiana-Arizona Nutrition for Precision Health Center (LAAZ-NPH), consisting of LSU-Pennington
Biomedical (PBRC) in Baton Rouge, LSU-Health Sciences Center (LSUHSC) in New Orleans, and the NIDDK-
Phoenix Clinical Center (PIMC) in Phoenix, is to participate in the NPH consortium as a clinical center to
recruit, enroll and retain more than 2000 participants in the three planned study modules. In Module 1, 2,000
from the All of Us Research Program in Louisiana (Baton Rouge and New Orleans; 600 each) and Arizona
(Phoenix; 800) will be enrolled in a 10-day prospective, observational study. Following the completion of
Module 1, 300 study participants who meet specified eligibility criteria for enrollment to the controlled feeding
studies, will participate in Module 2 (PBRC, LSUHSC and PIMC; 100 each) and at least 100 in Module 3
(PBRC and PIMC only; ≥50 each). Module 2 is a controlled feeding study in an outpatient setting with 300
study participants while Module 3 is a controlled feeding study in an inpatient setting with at least 100 study
participants that completed Module 1. Modules 2 and 3 will use a block randomization cross-over study design
to evaluate the individual response to three, 14-day isocaloric diet interventions. The three intervention diets (a
combination of the Mediterranean and DASH diet (MEDASH); a sustainable predominantly plant-based
Flexitarian diet (FLEX) and a Highly Preferred Western Diet (HPWD) will be separated by a 7-21 day wash out
periods. Our primary endpoint is the post-prandial plasma glucose response (PPGR) to a standardized mixed
meal tolerance test (MMTT) as measured by the incremental glucose area under the curve over 180 min
(AUC180). Secondary endpoints are biomarkers of cardiometabolic health including insulin resistance and a
metabolic syndrome score. The rich set of data and biospecimens collected by our proposed center will be
used to inform paradigm shifting approaches that enable large-scale delivery of personalized dietary
prescriptions to promote general health, delay cardiometabolic diseases, and importantly address health
disparities."
10931666,"7. Project Summary/Abstract
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease in North America (1). Hepatic
steatosis (HS) is the hallmark of NAFLD (2). NAFLD may transition in sub-groups to chronic inflammation (non-
alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH), and ultimately to cirrhosis. HS is prevalent in all stages of NAFLD. 3-10% of
all children in the US and 40-70% of obese children have HS (3). There are approximately 15 million obese
children in the US (4), meaning that as many as 10 million youths have HS. Pediatric HS is associated with
premature mortality due to type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease (CVD) and progressive liver disease
in early adulthood (5,6). Successful treatment of pediatric HS is therefore central to long-term metabolic and
cardiovascular health. Recommended options are largely limited to behavioral modifications (i.e., weight loss
and exercise) and nutritional supplement with Vitamin E (3,5-7). There is no FDA-approved drug for the
treatment of NAFLD in individuals of any age.
 We propose to perform a randomized clinical trial (RCT) in youths with HS. We will expand our previous
study in which treatment with our essential amino acid (EAA)-based composition called AMS2392 reduced liver
fat in adolescent females with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
Specific Aim 1. We will investigate the hypothesis that 8 weeks of treatment with AMS2392 will reduce liver fat
in youths with HS. We will perform a double-blind RCT in 48 male and female youths 13 to 18 years of age
(Tanner stage 4 or 5) with biopsy-documented HS. Liver fat content will be measured by magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) at the outset and after the eight-week intervention.
Specific Aim 2. We propose that secondary end points of liver stiffness, body composition, insulin sensitivity,
and plasma concentrations of very-low density triglycerides (VLDL-TG), alanine transaminase (ALT), ApoB100,
creatinine and insulin sensitivity will be improved in the group receiving AMS2392 as compared to placebo.
Specific Aim 3. Adherence to protocol will be greater than 90% and there will be no adverse events in those
consuming AMS2392, including no change in plasma glutathione concentration.
 Completion of this RCT will provide information regarding efficacy, effect size, safety and tolerance that
will position us to successfully market AMS2392 as a medical nutrition product."
10747856,"Project Summary/Abstract
Colon cancer and colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) are a significant and increasingly lethal disease. Though
there is a strong scientific premise to harness the immune system to treat this cancer, there remains a funda-
mental gap in understanding of how immunotherapies can be utilized for the majority of these tumors, particu-
larly microsatellite stable cancers. The central hypothesis is that the tumor microenvironment can be manipu-
lated to enhance cytotoxic lymphocyte infiltration and activation, and that checkpoint blockade can be simulta-
neously utilized to incite a clinically relevant immune response. This “one-two punch” hypothesis has been
formulated on the basis of preliminary data produced by the applicant where increased T-cell trafficking to tu-
mors, when combined with CTLA4 blockade, resulted in complete CRLM regressions. The rationale for the
proposed research is that once it is known how to enhance immunostimulatory signals in the microenvironment
and simultaneously suppress inhibitory influences, a new strategy for the management of colon cancer is pos-
sible. Supported by a very strong scientific premise based on published papers and robust preliminary data,
this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine mechanisms to enhance lympho-
cyte proliferation and anti-tumor specific immune responses in colon cancer by manipulating immunosuppres-
sive signals, 2) Examine mechanisms that supply immunostimulatory influences directly into the tumor; and 3)
Combine checkpoint blockade with selective delivery of human LIGHT to treat surgically resected tumors and
human CRLM in a pre-clinical autologous system. Under the first aim we expect to increase lymphocyte infiltra-
tion, proliferation and activation while simultaneously curbing immunosuppressive signals/cells in the microen-
vironment utilizing a validated pre-clinical model established by the applicants. In the second aim, a clinically
relevant method to safely increase LIGHT expression within colon cancer tumors using novel tumor-specific
viral delivery mechanisms engineered by the applicants will be analyzed. Under the third aim, patient tumors
will be utilized in an autologous humanized mouse model and treated with CTLA4 blockade combined with on-
colytic viral delivery mechanisms to increase LIGHT expression. The proposed research is innovative, because
the multi-combination therapy of LIGHT expression in CRLM with tumor-specific oncolysis and checkpoint
blockade will deliver an inventive approach that will be universally applicable from patient to patient. New hori-
zons that will stem from this innovative strategy include a better understanding of anti-CTLA4 biology that may
not only enhance response rates, but also vastly increase indications for its use in previously “cold” tumors,
including microsatellite stable gastrointestinal cancer. This contribution will be significant because it will estab-
lish a synergistic combination of immunotherapies that will have direct translational impact on one of the dead-
liest cancers worldwide. The implications of our results may improve patient quality of life and provide survival
advantages over the best current surgical and chemotherapeutic strategies for this disease.

The healthy cornea is an avascular tissue which is a requirement for optical clarity and good vision. Diseases
in which the optical clarity of the cornea is lost are the third most common cause of blindness worldwide.
Various disease conditions, such as corneal injury, can result in inflammation and the pathological ingrowth
of vessels into the cornea, a process known as corneal neovascularization (CNV). Prevention of vascular
ingrowth is imperative in maintaining the health and transparency of the cornea. We have previously
demonstrated that MG53, a tissue repair gene, can promote corneal wound healing in both the epithelium
and stroma. We recently discovered that MG53 can modulate corneal inflammation and vascularization. An
approach that can functionally target multiple steps in corneal wound healing may have the potential to
significantly improve healing outcomes, leading to novel therapeutic options. MG53 is present in the human
tear film, aqueous humor, and corneal epithelial cells, supporting its potential function in corneal homeostasis
and wound healing. We show that genetic ablation of MG53 leads to pronounced corneal inflammation and
neovascularization as compared to wild type littermates. Using in vivo corneal injury models, we find that MG53
promotes corneal transparency by reducing acute inflammation and post-injury vascularization. Biochemical and
animal studies revealed that pyroptosis, a cytolytic cell death, is a novel pathway involved in post-injury CNV, as
observed in gasdermin D, a key molecule of pyroptosis, knockout corneas which were resistant to injury-induced
CNV. Further, MG53 can inhibit pyroptosis by interacting with gasdermin D, preventing its activation. In vivo
corneal wounding experiments revealed corneal pyroptosis followed neutrophil infiltration. Antibody depletion of
neutrophils completely abolished post-injury pyroptosis, suggesting infiltrating neutrophils undergoing pyroptosis
trigger secondary corneal injury and CNV. Indeed, when irradiated WT recipient mice received bone marrow
(BM) transplantation from GsdmD-/- mice, they displayed enhanced corneal healing as compared to mice that
received BM from WT mice. Experiments outlined in this project are centered on testing the hypothesis that
neutrophil pyroptosis is a key pathway that mediates corneal inflammation and CNV following injury; MG53 can
inhibit pyroptosis via preventing activation of GasdmD, thus rhMG53 can be used as an effective means to treat
corneal injury. We envision that MG53 can be applied to promote corneal healing and prevent neovascularization
after injury. The outcome of this research shall have significant translational value in developing potentially
effective therapies to treat corneal injury and neovascularization associated with corneal disease."
10747860,"The vast majority (>80%) of patients with BRAFV600E/K melanomas initially respond to highly
specific BRAFV600E/K inhibitors as monotherapy or BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination therapy,

of their tumor cells are carrying the BRAF mutations. In this application, we focus on the
biological dynamics of small populations within BRAFV600E/K melanomas that are a priori
resistant or rapidly adapt upon treatment and drive eventual relapse. In the first aim we will
follow the dynamics of mutant BRAFV600E/K melanoma cells treated with BRAF and MEK
inhibitor combinations. We have identified a slow-cycling subpopulation that is dynamically
changing as the cells survive the initial treatment, then persist and finally regrow with acquired
resistance to a variety of drugs. We will follow the cells in in vitro and in vivo models of human
melanoma using bar codes and single cell RNA analyses. These studies will not only determine
whether minor subpopulation(s) evolve under drug treatment stochastically or hierarchically, but
also will provide us with information on their pre-existence and/or whether malignant cell
plasticity is the major reason for intra-tumor heterogeneity to drug responses. In the second aim,
we are testing the hypothesis that intrinsically resistant subpopulations of cells present new
therapeutic opportunities that, if targeted, will specifically inhibit the onset of resistance. Our
preliminary studies using CRISPR/Cas9 have allowed us to functionally dissect the pathways
that form these rare subpopulations and, separately, the pathways that allow those
subpopulations to reprogram. We will validate hits in 3D culture systems and in in vivo mouse
models. We expect that targeting separate aspects of the resistance process in a rationally
designed way (in vitro and then in preclinical studies) will enable the reduction of resistance
onset upon BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy."

10747106,"Background: VA is tasked with providing timely, high-quality specialty care for nearly 3 million Veterans, yet
faces unique challenges in doing so, including a large rural Veteran population and specialty provider
shortages. These challenges are particularly evident for pulmonary hypertension (PH), a devastating and
prevalent disease among Veterans with a median survival of only 3.9 years. Patients with PH require frequent
access to PH experts and careful coordination across multidisciplinary teams and facilities to ensure high-
quality care. Yet, VA has not taken a coordinated approach to PH care, and as a result there are wide gaps in
PH care access and quality across VA. The redesign of VA PH care into a hub-and-spoke model is a guideline-
recommended, evidence-based solution to improve PH care quality. The integration of telehealth technologies
into this model, a “telehealth-enhanced hub-and-spoke model,” can advance this model to ensure every
Veteran has equal access to state-of-the-art PH care. Yet, before this innovative solution can be implemented,
several critical research and implementation questions must be addressed, including how to adapt other hub-
and-spoke models to unique PH challenges, and which model components are key to improve outcomes. To
address these knowledge gaps, this proposal will leverage survey data paired with in-depth qualitative
analyses to understand provider and organizational characteristics of high-quality PH care within potential hub
sites. This knowledge will inform the co-design of an implementation blueprint with stakeholder input that will
be used to pilot test the telehealth-enhanced hub-and-spoke model in VISN 1.
Significance/Impact: This research has the potential to improve the organization, access, quality, equity, and
coordination of care for the more than 250,000 Veterans living with PH. Furthermore, by developing a process
to design a telehealth-enhanced hub-and-spoke model that is driven by scientific hypotheses, grounded in
theory, and integrates key stakeholder perspectives, this work will provide VA with key guidance to redesign
specialty care for other specialty conditions.
Innovation: The union of telehealth technologies with the organizational redesign of PH care into hub and
spoke sites represents an innovative model of excellence for PH care to comprehensively address current
gaps in PH care delivery across VA. Additionally, the integration of co-design with health services research and
implementation science to develop a scalable solution to PH care delivery is an innovative approach that will
ensure the solution is relevant and acceptable to key stakeholder groups while being rigorously evaluated for
effectiveness and broader application to other complex redesign and implementation questions.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: Characterize stakeholder perspectives on PH hub site care delivery through mixed
methods. Aim 2: Co-design a blueprint for the reorganization of PH care into a telehealth-enhanced hub-and-
spoke model. Aim 3: Assess feasibility and acceptability of core components of the hub-and-spoke model.
Methodology: In Aim 1a, I will conduct a survey of Veterans and providers within the 22 VA sites that have
existing PH expert clinics (potential future hub sites) to identify provider and organizational characteristics of
high-quality care. In Aim 1b, I will conduct qualitative interviews of Veterans, providers, and clinical leaders at
these potential hub sites to explore their perspectives on current VA PH care and the redesign of care into a
hub-and-spoke model. In Aim 2, I will partner with stakeholders to co-design an implementation blueprint that
comprehensively describes 1) the components of a telehealth-enhanced hub-and-spoke model, 2) evaluation
metrics, and 3) implementation strategies. In Aim 3, I will use the implementation blueprint to pilot test the
model across 2 VISN 1 sites and will assess its feasibility and acceptability.
Next Steps/Implementation: This work will lead to the submission of two IIR proposals, including a hybrid
implementation-effectiveness stepped wedge study across all 8 VISN 1 sites."
10918085,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is one of the major causative agents of urinary tract infections (UTIs).
With growing frequency of antibiotic treatment failure and slowing of antibiotic discovery, the rate of recurrent
UTIs is poised to continue to increase. Although antibiotic resistant pathogens are of particular concern,
treatment failure can often occur by non-genetic mechanisms, without detectable resistance. One of the non-
genetic mechanisms of antibiotic treatment failure—persistence—is characterized by antibiotic tolerance in a
small group of cells among a susceptible population. Bacterial persisters, which can reversibly exit the antibiotic-
tolerant state following drug removal, is able to repopulate an infection and impede success of treatment.
Persisters are known to be enriched in slow growing populations, where overall cellular activity and metabolism
is reduced; however, there is a lack of knowledge on how the surrounding nutrient environment can affect
bacterial physiology, and how these factors affect susceptibility to antibiotics.
Our central objective is to determine the impact of carbon source availability on UPEC persistence to
fluoroquinolone (FQ) antibiotics, which are bactericidal through the targeting of DNA topoisomerases and the
accumulation of DNA damage. Aim 1 aims to address changes to metabolism, biomolecular synthesis, and DNA
integrity in response to carbon source availability during FQ treatment. We will assess these factors by
performing experiments with fluorescence-based probes, as well as mass spectrometry analysis of metabolites.
These data will elucidate the ways by which carbon source availability can impact the susceptibility of cells to
FQs, allowing us to explore specific mechanisms as potentiation targets. Aim 2 will enable us to understand how
the coordination of DNA damage response changes due to carbon source availability after FQ treatment. We
will deploy powerful genetic approaches and RNA sequencing in E. coli to interrogate the timing of gene
expression and DNA repair. Completion of this aims will provide great insight into the importance of various DNA
repair mechanisms in response to FQ treatment.
Overall, the completion of these aims will reveal metabolic, biosynthetic, and expressional changes that underlie
FQ persistence in E. coli. This information could illuminate potential genes that can be targeted to potentiate the
activity of FQs and reduce resistance development in persister progenies. Additionally, these findings could lead
to interesting implications for clinical infections, with a potential connection between host metabolism and
antibiotic efficacy. This research could highlight the potential of adding glucose, as well as other metabolites, as
supplemented compounds during antibiotic administration to improve the treatment of infections."
10744761,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Modern cancer biology leans heavily on kinase inhibitors as a means to probe the consequences of
deactivating a particular kinase, but the majority of commonly-used chemical probes are not sufficiently target-
selective for robust interpretation of the observed phenotypes. By assembling large panels of kinases
(corresponding to much of the human kinome), it has become possible to determine the selectivity for a given
probe: however, these experiments are expensive and impractical to perform at high throughput. We have
recently developed a new computational approach for rapidly and accurately building 3D structural models of
individual inhibitor/kinase complexes. Aim 1 of this project entails applying deep learning to build models for
predicting the binding affinity of individual inhibitor/kinase pairs, using 3D structural descriptors derived from
the corresponding inhibitor/kinase complexes. Aim 2 of this project will build very large computational libraries
of novel chemical matter, enriched in compounds with 3D properties that complement kinase binding sites. We
will first use the tools developed in Aim 1 to re-evaluate the selectivity of chemical probes that are widely used
by cell biologists, thus informing on which ones are useful tools and which ones should be deprecated. To
provide a replacement for the outdated chemical probes, we will computationally screen the libraries of Aim 2
for more selective compounds, focusing first on CDK kinases and several kinases that represent therapeutic
vulnerabilities in GIST. We will synthesize the top-scoring computational hits, and characterize them using an
escalation of biochemical assays, proteomic kinome profiling, structural biology, and cellular assays. If
successful, this project will deliver new chemical probes for several hitherto unaddressed (“orphan”) kinases, to
serve as chemical tools and as starting point for drug development. Equally importantly though, completion of
this project will provide a robust and validated approach for designing potent and selective kinase inhibitors, to
be subsequently applied for developing new high-quality probes against each of the 500 human kinases."
10744764,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the U.S with 142,670 deaths expected in 2019, 90%
caused by cigarette smoking. Worldwide, there are 1 billion smokers and 1.6 million lung cancer deaths per
year. Smokeless tobacco, a cause of oral cavity, esophagus, and pancreas cancer, is another deadly tobacco
product. The tobacco-specific nitrosamines N'-nitrosonornicotine (NNN) and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-
pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) are among the most important carcinogens in tobacco products, considered by the
International Agency for Research on Cancer to be “carcinogenic to humans.” Here, we extend our research
on NNN and NNK by developing new urinary biomarkers from interactions of their metabolites with amino acids
and DNA. We also propose unique new methodology which can determine which oral cell DNA adducts – in
addition to those derived from tobacco-specific nitrosamines – result from exposure to compounds in cigarette
smoke. This will be accomplished using high resolution DNA adductomics techniques to identify DNA adducts
in oral cells of people who have smoked cigarettes containing [13C]-labelled tobacco. We will use our biomarker
and DNA adduct data to analyze oral cell DNA, lung DNA, and urine samples in our Lung Cancer and
Pulmonary Nodule Biorepository, with the goal of using readily obtainable samples (e.g. oral cells or urine) to
predict DNA adduct levels in smokers' lungs. The specific aims are:
1. Develop human urinary biomarkers of NNN exposure based on interactions of its metabolites with amino
 acids. These will be the first metabolite biomarkers specific to exposure to this powerful oral cavity
carcinogen.
2. Develop an analytical method for quantitation of 7-[4-(3-pyridyl)-4-hydroxybutyl]guanine (7-PHB-G) as a
 human urinary DNA/RNA adduct biomarker of tobacco-specific nitrosamine exposure plus metabolic
 activation. 7-PHB-G will be the first urinary biomarker of specific DNA adduct formation by NNN and NNK.
3. Prepare cigarettes from specially grown fully [13C]-labelled tobacco and use high resolution mass
 spectrometry-based DNA adductomics techniques to specifically identify which oral cell DNA adducts
 originate from tobacco in people who smoke these cigarettes. This aim promises to resolve longstanding
 uncertainty about which DNA adducts result from cigarette smoke exposure.
4. Compare tobacco-specific and tobacco-related DNA adduct formation in lung tissue and oral cells from
 cigarette smokers, and relate to urinary biomarkers of tobacco exposure.
These specific aims can result in new biomarkers of tobacco-related exposures and cancer risk and ultimately
test our overall hypothesis that biomarkers, combined with certain genetic information, can identify those
tobacco users at highest risk for cancer, so that effective preventive measures can be initiated. The biomarkers
developed in this program also have potential application in tobacco product evaluation and regulation."
10844374,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The E2F transcriptional program, which controls cell cycle commitment and progression in proliferating
cells, is upregulated following DNA damage in neurons. Neuronal DNA damage and cell cycle dysregulation
are features of neurodegeneration that have also been associated with psychiatric diseases. Although the
function of E2F during proliferation has been extensively studied, the role of E2F in nonproliferating cells, such
as in neurons, has received less attention. Emerging evidence indicates that E2F plays a role in DNA damage
repair, independent of its role in cell cycle entry. This role may be especially important in neurons, which are
uniquely vulnerable to DNA damage. Although E2F induction has been linked to resolution of DNA damage in
bulk-cell preparations of neurons, such bulk analyses fail to account for potentially confounding heterogeneity
within samples. Single cell analysis is necessary to examine the relationship between E2F activity and DNA
damage and to link E2F dynamics to functional outcomes in the same cells.
 The Meyer Lab specializes in single-cell analysis of high-throughput microscopy data, and the lab has
recently developed a fluorescent biosensor of E2F activity for this purpose. Quantitative microscopy using live-
and fixed-cell readouts of E2F activity and DNA damage will allow signaling history to be mapped to cell fate
outcomes at single-cell resolution in thousands of cells. My hypothesis is that in postmitotic neurons, E2F is
reversibly activated to drive DNA repair without DNA replication following sublethal DNA damage; however, if
DNA damage activates E2F beyond the threshold for S-phase entry, E2F induces DNA replication and
apoptosis. By characterizing how the E2F program is regulated in neurons and how it contributes to DNA
damage repair, this study will support the identification of potential treatment targets for preserving genetic
integrity in brain disorders characterized by genotoxic stress.
 This research project represents an important component of my training for a career as an independent

The overall goal of this multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary grant is to bring histotripsy closer to widespread
human clinical use by developing a C-arm based platform to plan, target, and assess histotripsy ablations.
Histotripsy is a unique noninvasive, nonthermal, nonionizing and highly precise ablation modality that has
recently undergone a successful phase I clinical trial. Rodent studies demonstrate the promise of histotripsy to
potentiate an anti-cancer immune effect and combine synergistically with check-point inhibition. Although
histotripsy has highly promising therapeutic capability, a major barrier to adoption is the lack of a reliable
method for visualizing and targeting tumors. Systems to date have only used conventional ultrasound imaging
for targeting the tumor and monitoring and assessing the ablation zone. Unfortunately, ultrasound is operator
dependent, inherently limited for evaluating 3D tumors and ablation zones, unable to penetrate certain biologic
tissues such as bone and gas, and is of limited use in patients with large body habitus. Conventional CT and
MRI are not ideal for histotripsy due to limited space and field of view as well as artifacts from the therapeutic
transducer and robotic arm. C-arm x-ray fluoroscopy with cone-beam CT (CBCT) is an excellent option for
targeting during histotripsy and a C-arm based platform would complement current US guidance techniques.
C-arms are ubiquitous with world-wide distribution and expertise, have an open design with easy access to the
patient, provide volumetric data from CBCT for treatment planning and ablation zone assessment, and 2D
fluoroscopy can be adapted to deliver real-time automatic and accurate targeting. To advance histotripsy
toward widespread human clinical use, we will develop a C-arm fluoroscopic and CBCT based
approach that can be used to plan, target, and assess histotripsy ablations. Aim 1 of this grant will be to
develop and validate C-arm based algorithms to accurately and automatically target a specific volume of tissue
for histotripsy ablation. To improve the precision of histotripsy treatments, we will then develop respiratory
motion compensation techniques in Aim 2. Aim 3 will develop a deep-learning approach to compensate for the
variable speed of sound through different biologic tissues (analogous to aberration correction). In Aim 4, we will
integrate the developments from Aims 1-3 and perform prospective validation studies in human-scale porcine
and rabbit VX2 tumor models to determine the accuracy, efficacy and safety of C-arm guided histotripsy as
well as its effect on survival. If successful, this grant will catalyze the use of C-arm fluoroscopy with CBCT to
plan, target, and assess histotripsy of liver tumors, and bring the technique closer to widespread human clinical
use."

 The overarching goals of this proposal are 1) to maintain retention of children in the INSPIRE birth
cohort with emphasis on diversity, and implementation of the ECHO Cohort Protocol with high fidelity, and 2)
tackle the major limitation in diagnosis and management of childhood asthma - addressing the need to identify
asthma phenotypes and endotypes to develop targeted treatment and prevention strategies.
 The term asthma is an umbrella diagnosis for several disease states with distinct variable clinical
presentations (phenotypes) and mechanistic pathways (endotypes). Central to understanding the causal role of
environmental exposures in asthma development and to disease management is identifying distinct asthma
phenotypes. The scientific aims of this proposal are: 1) Aim 1: to determine the incidence and prevalence
of two highly relevant asthma phenotypes, atopic and non-atopic asthma, by age, sex, cohort decade and
geographic location, using widely available and harmonized variables and those collected through the ECHO
Cohort Protocol. We will also determine the contribution of established environmental risk and protective
factors with these specific clinically relevant asthma phenotypes. Lastly, we will calculate comparative
estimates of childhood asthma morbidity by asthma phenotypes; 2) Aim 2: to further characterize asthma
phenotypes and endotypes into clinically useful entities within the ECHO consortium and expand the findings
to clinical practice by utilizing available or to be collected samples to add biomarkers of asthma routinely
available in clinical practice, and nasal samples to perform transcriptomic analyses to define asthma
endotypes; 3) Aim 3: to facilitate and oversee longitudinal follow-up of the established INSPIRE cohort, and
biosample collection to maximize retention of existing participants with emphasis on diversity, and implement
the ECHO Cohort Protocol with high fidelity. The INSPIRE birth cohort is a population-based birth cohort study
that originally enrolled over 1950 term healthy infants. INSPIRE is unique in including surveillance for infant
respiratory viral infection through biweekly active and passive surveillance using PCR for viral detection and
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) serology at age one. The children will be ages 8-10 years when the current
ECHO funding period ends, entering adolescence, and will be followed to age 15-17 years during this next
funding period.
 The proposed research is an innovative, novel, multi-faceted and practical approach to move away
from viewing “asthma” as a single umbrella disease, and identifying and understanding asthma phenotypes,
endotypes, and the influence of risk and protective factors on specific asthma phenotypes. The approach we
propose is also practical in moving toward solutions that utilize currently available technologies and laboratory
testing to aide in development of diagnostic criteria for childhood asthma sub-types."

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is the third most common cause of cardiovascular morbidity worldwide, present
in 20% of the population over 65. If PAD is not treated, it can progress to critical limb ischemia, resulting in tissue
necrosis and eventual limb amputation. Vasculogenesis, the process of de novo vessel formation from progenitor
cells, may prove an effective therapeutic strategy. Vasculogenesis may be accomplished by delivering vascular
progenitor cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs-EPs), which have recently emerged
as a promising, patient-specific therapy. However, the optimal conditions for iPSCs-EPs engraftment and
anastomosis with the host vasculature are unclear, specifically, since the underlying molecular mechanisms that
guide these cells' self-assembly into vascular networks are poorly understood.
To overcome this hurdle, we propose to develop engineered vasculogenic hydrogels, presenting tunable
cues at the cell-matrix interface, that can enhance the therapeutic vasculogenesis of iPSC-EPs for
peripheral ischemia recovery and define the underlying mechanisms through which matrix properties
control vasculogenesis.
Previous work by us and others has shown that stable vascular network formation depends on both cell type and
matrix properties such as stiffness and degradability. Highly degradable matrices such as collagen may support
vasculogenesis initially, but long-term stability is challenging. Furthermore, these matrix properties are coupled
and impact endothelial and perivascular cell sprouting at different time scales in neo-vascular network formation.
Therefore, we hypothesize that temporal, in situ control over local matrix mechanics and degradability in
synthetic matrices will synergistically regulate the vascular morphogenesis of hiPSC-EPs, lead to stable, mature
vascular network formation and improve hind limb ischemia recovery. To test our hypothesis, we propose a
hybrid interpenetrating hydrogel network (IPN) comprised of collagen and norbornene-modified hyaluronic acid
(Coll/NorHA). This system has the advantage of combining the natural cues presented by collagen binding sites
and fibrous architecture with the in situ dynamic tunability of synthetic NorHA. Our goal is to 1) elucidate the
interplay between time-dependent matrix properties and mechanisms that govern vascular network development
and 2) enhance therapeutic vasculogenesis for PAD. In Aim 1, we will modulate the elasticity in these hydrogels
using in situ cross-linking reactions. We will study how stiffening at specific timepoints impacts the resulting
vasculogenic response both in vitro and in vivo in a skin fold model. In a complementary approach to Aim 1, in
Aim 2, we will isolate the effects of matrix degradability on iPSC-EPs vasculogenic potential using Coll/NorHA
IPNs in which proteolytic susceptibility is tuned with matrix metalloprotease-degradable peptides. In Aim 3, we
will test the synergistic impact of coupling matrix mechanics and degradability on iPSC-derived capillary plexus
formation. Specifically, we will elucidate how the maturation level of the in vitro grown vascular plexus enables
in vivo perfusion with host vasculature.
In summary, we propose to enhance therapeutic vasculogenesis of iPSC-EPs for peripheral artery disease
treatment through control of engineered matrix properties using a tunable Coll/NorHA IPN that mimics the
hierarchical temporal structure of native ECM. Elucidating the interplay between matrix properties and
mechanisms that govern vascular network development will identify angiogenic biomaterials that may be
deployed in the clinic to improve patients' vascular health and aid in disease modeling."

Devastating human primary mitochondrial disorders are caused by pathogenic mtDNA variants and frequently
evolve into organ failures referred to, as mitochondrial-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome
(MIMODS). The underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms are more complex than a mere decrease in ATP pro-
duction and very little is known about these complex processes in a tissue-specific manner. There is thus an
urgent unmet need to assess the impact of the widespread mitochondrial dysfunction in multiple tissues leading
to MIMODS. We have demonstrated deleterious outcomes of widespread mitochondrial dysfunction (lowered
bioenergetics health index, abnormal mitochondrial morphology, elevated putrescine levels) in multiple pediat-
ric PMD dermal fibroblasts carrying unique pathogenic mtDNA variants. Based on our findings, we hypothesize
that elevated putrescine levels cause oxidative stress response and widespread mitochondrial dysfunction that
contributes to MIMODS in cellular models of primary mitochondrial disorders. Our collaborative team will de-
sign experiments and build upon established expertise in mitochondrial genetics and physiology, stem cell biol-
ogy and differentiation, next-generation sequencing analysis and metabolite profiling to address the following
research aims: In Aim 1, we will comprehensively assess mitochondrial dysfunction in twenty pediatric diseased
fibroblasts with a confirmed diagnosis of PMDs, along with five age matched controls. We will assess the oxida-
tive stress markers, NAD/NADH redox biochemistry, metabolomics, mitochondrial respiration and morphology.
In aim 2, we will seek to understand tissue-specific abnormalities associated with mitochondrial dysfunction in
neurons, cardiomyocytes and podocytes. In aim 3, we will assess the effect of targeted interventions of reducing
oxidative stress and improving mitochondrial respiration in multiple differentiated cell types that exhibit ele-
vated putrescine levels; and in multiple tissues from preclinical mouse models of PMD. The completion of these
aims will contribute to a newer understanding of putrescine metabolism in multiple energy-intensive cell types
derived from patients with pediatric PMD and its role in triggering MIMODS. In the long-term, our studies have
the potential to develop strategies for individualized testing of patient cells with candidate therapeutics to drive
rational, personalized therapies."

Significant neurological delay is emerging as one the most important current challenges for children with
congenital heart disease (CHD), yet few treatment options are currently available. In our first period of funding,
we proposed the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) as a cell delivery system in infants with CHD as a novel
approach for improving the neurological impairments in CHD. Our published and unpublished work has
demonstrated the efficacy and utility of this approach, determining the systemic effects of delivery bone marrow-
derived mesenchymal stromal cell (BM-MSC) via CPB and the effect on white matter (WM) and sub-ventricular
zone (SVZ) development. Most notably, the first award successfully led to development of a phase 1 clinical trial
termed “MeDCaP” at Children’s National. Using our translational piglet model, we have demonstrated cellular,
structural, and behavioral improvements after BM-MSC delivery through CPB and generated critical information
for bench-to-bedside translation. However, the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic action of BM-MSCs still
remain largely unknown. This R01 renewal will address the key knowledge gaps with the goal of further
enhancing our cell-based treatment for neuroprotection in the CHD population. Exosome is a class of
extracellular vesicles loaded with bioactive molecules such as microRNA (miRNA). Exosomes derived from BM-
MSCs (BM-MSCexo) can play a major role in the effects on surrounding cells and tissues and elicit favorable
responses in various diseases. We have established a pipeline for post-cell delivery integrated transcriptomic
analysis of exosomal miRNAs from BM-MSCs and host tissue mRNA. Our preliminary studies have identified
the BM-MSCexo-derived miRNAs as putative key drivers of reduced neuronal apoptosis and microglial activation
observed after BM-MSC treatment in the cerebral cortex. The overarching goal of this renewal proposal is to
establish detailed molecular signatures from critical cell populations for tissue repair and regeneration at single
cell resolution after BM-MSC delivery; we will then use those molecular signatures as roadmaps to identify novel
molecular entities within the BM-MSCexo that account for the disease-modifying bioactivity in tissue injury after
pediatric cardiac surgery. The renewal studies will test our central hypothesis that specific exosomal cargo
constituents from BM-MSCs promote repair and regenerative processes both through neural progenitors and
regulatory T cells, thereby improving neurological outcomes and post-operative course. To retroactively identify
key exosomal bioactive molecules, we will determine the transcriptional and chromatin landscape of three
specific cell populations: 1) SVZ neural stem and progenitor cells; 2) WM oligodendrocytes; and 3) regulatory T
cells. Together with our ongoing clinical trial established based on the previous award, identifying molecular
signatures of BM-MSC treatment and mining specific BM-MSCexo for unique CPB pathology will significantly
improve our understanding of this cell-based treatment and will provide a new therapeutic paradigm for potential
cell-free MSC-based therapies for neuroprotection in children with CHD."
10914978,"PROJECT SUMMARY / DESCRIPTION
How does a healthy child grow? Asked by every parent, the simplicity of this question masks the complex nature
of child development and makes light of the diverse environmental factors and variables that shape a child’s
emerging physical health and neurodevelopment. Beginning at conception and accelerating throughout
childhood and adolescence, our unique environmental exposures and social experiences shape our behaviors,
impact our health, and influence our developing cognitive skills and abilities. Far from being distinct entities,
aspects of physical health and neurodevelopment evolve dynamically together in a bi-directional feedback cycle
that promotes healthy or rapidly worsening outcomes. At every stage of this cycle, factors that affect the child
(e.g., sleep, chemical exposures, discrimination), their family (e.g., family sociodemographic characteristics),
and their neighborhood (e.g., neighborhood safety, school quality) can improve health or accelerate decline.
Over the past two years, the COVID-19 pandemic has ushered in widespread disruptions to almost every
aspect of a child and family’s life, with disproportionate impacts on lower-income, and racial and ethnic minority
families. Differences in public health responses across the ECHO Cohort offer an important opportunity to
understand how these multi-level factors, including social determinants of health (SDoH), have moderated child
physical health and neurodevelopment. Leveraging the ECHO Cohort and taking a team science approach, this
proposal aims to understand the dynamic relationships that link child neurodevelopment and two pressing public
health challenges: pediatric asthma and obesity; and the influence of specific multi-level moderators (chemical
exposures, child sleep, physical activity, and key SDoH factors). We will examine: 1. How child
neurodevelopment and physical health outcomes, specifically asthma, and obesity are shaped by chemical,
biological, and social environmental exposures; 2. How physical health and neurodevelopment co-develop and
reinforce each other throughout childhood; 3. How lived experiences across the child, family, and neighborhood
contexts, including SDoH, moderate neurodevelopmental outcomes; and 4. How these relationships have been
changed by the COVID-19 pandemic and varied across racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic dimensions. Through
a comprehensive Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives (PEDP), we take an intentional approach to include
the social, psychosocial, and economic inequalities, constraints, and behavioral norms that underlie disparities
in neurodevelopment and child physical health outcomes. With core tenets of access and inclusion, we will re-
enroll our Cohort Study Site (RESONANCE) comprising >1650 well-characterized family-child dyads from
diverse sociodemographic backgrounds across Rhode Island. Using novel remote data collection and mobile
labs, we will address traditional barriers to research participation and access while ensuring adherence and high
data quality across all core elements and biospecimens. Outcomes from our solutions-oriented research will
have a direct and meaningful impact on health interventions and public policy guidance."
10883739,"Abstract: African Americans (AA) show disparities in ischemic stroke when compared to Euro-Americans, with
2x higher stroke prevalence and mortality, 4x higher incidence of ischemic stroke during middle age, as well as
greater stroke disability, more post-stroke complications, and slower recovery. To reduce stroke morbidity and
mortality and advance therapies to better treat AA with ischemic stroke, an improvement in our understanding of
the basic pathways that regulate oxidative stress damage and cerebral blood flow is needed. Preclinical and
clinical evidence suggest that redox imbalance occurs in ischemic stroke, with increased oxidant formation and
suppressed nitric oxide (NO) signaling, which may be more compromised in the AA population. However, the
mechanisms that contribute to redox imbalance in AA with ischemic stroke remain a major gap in our knowledge.
We have identified that a high frequency variant in cytochrome b5 reductase 3 (CYB5R3) exists in the AA
population (23% minor allele frequency), compared to less than 1% in whites. This CYB5R3 missense variant
confers a threonine to serine amino acid change (T117S) leading to reduced CYB5R3 activity. To test the
importance of this variant in cerebral vascular function following ischemic stroke, we generated a novel CYB5R3
T117S murine model. Preliminary studies show that CYB5R3 T117S mice develop significantly greater infarct
volume, suggesting that CYB5R3 T117S mice are more vulnerable to oxidative stress. Mechanistically, our pilot
studies suggest CYB5R3 T117S serves as a redox regulator of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), the nitric oxide
receptor. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that CYB5R3 T117S causes a redox imbalance by
impairing sGC heme redox regulation leading to exacerbated cerebral blood flow deficiency and ischemic stroke.
Three aims are proposed to test this hypothesis: Aim 1) define whether impaired cerebrovascular function in
Cyb5R3 T117S and SMC Cyb5R3 KO mice causes greater brain infarct and worsened stroke outcomes, Aim
2) determine whether NO-sGC-cGMP-mediated cerebral blood vessel damage causes dysregulation of cerebral
arterial relaxation in Cyb5R3 T117S mice and SMC Cyb5R3 KO mice after ischemic stroke, and Aim
3) determine whether sGC activator and/or sGC stimulator therapy reduces stroke damage in Cyb5R3 T117S
and SMC Cyb5R3 KO mice. Completion of these studies will fill a major gap in our understanding of the role of
CYB5R3 T117S in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke, potentially developing new precision strategies and
therapies for a large proportion of AA who suffer from ischemic stroke.

 COVID-19 is associated with a growing number of peripheral and central nervous system complications.
It has become clear that a subset of these syndromes, including acute necrotizing encephalopathy, steroid-
responsive encephalitis and Guillain-Barré syndrome, are likely due to direct viral neuroinvasion and/or
autoimmunity triggered by SARS-CoV-2. There is an urgent need to prospectively investigate the acute and
chronic neurologic complications of COVID-19 and determine which syndromes are neuroinflammatory in origin.
While anti-viral therapeutics are still being developed for SARS-CoV-2, autoimmune CNS conditions can be very
responsive to immunosuppression. Thus, identifying biomarkers for a subset of COVID-19 patients with
autoimmune CNS syndromes in particular could immediately impact clinical management.
 Over the past 8 years, a unique interdisciplinary team of neurologists and basic scientists at UCSF was
formed to develop and deploy an integrated approach to rapidly identify microbial nucleic acid, anti-viral
antibodies and anti-neural antibodies associated with encephalitis, with the explicit intent to discover and
validate clinically actionable biomarkers in addition to uncovering the fundamental mechanisms of disease
pathogenesis underlying these syndromes. The centerpiece of these efforts is an ongoing patient cohort called
the NID (Neuroinflammatory Disease) cohort, consisting of patients with suspected infectious or inflammatory
encephalitis. This cohort is now >1,400 patients referred by clinicians at UCSF and from other centers around
the world. Already, this cohort has spurred the development of the first ever clinically validated cerebrospinal
fluid metagenomic next-generation sequencing assay, the identification of a novel paraneoplastic autoimmune
syndrome with important implications for men with seminoma and the identification of enteroviral CSF
antibodies in children with acute flaccid myelitis. Here, we propose to adapt this existing clinical research
and laboratory infrastructure to enroll and investigate the urgent question whether COVID-19 patients
with ongoing neurologic sequelae have CNS inflammation. We will perform this work in collaboration
with colleagues at the NIH, Yale University as well as at UCSF Medical Center, Zuckerberg San
Francisco General Hospital and UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital. Using our unique clinical and molecular
approach, we will investigate this hypothesis through the following specific aims:
Aim 1: Characterize autoantibodies in the CSF of COVID-19 patients with acute and chronic neurologic
syndromes
Aim 2: Identify CSF specific antibody repertoires in COVID-19 patients with neurologic complications using
high-resolution SARS-CoV-2 proteome-wide antibody profiling
Aim 3: Elucidate autoantibody pathogenicity through production of monoclonal antibodies from clonally
expanded CSF B cells in COVID-19 patients to enable the development of animal models of disease"
10745975,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Up to two thirds of those who survive acute respiratory failure (ARF) requiring mechanical ventilation suffer
from symptoms of anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after leaving the intensive
care unit (ICU). Memories of frightening and delusional experiences in the ICU appear to be the strongest
potentially modifiable risk factor. Research on the formation of fear and associated memories shows that if
mitigating information about a traumatic event is introduced during the time between memory formation and its
recall, the emotional experience of the memory can be modified in a positive manner. This means that in order
to prevent mental health problems in ARF patients, psychological support needs to take place in parallel with
medical treatment in the ICU. Previously, application of Psychological Support Based on Positive Suggestions
(PSBPS) resulted in shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and decreased need for sedatives. We
hypothesize that PSBPS can also mitigate mental health morbidity in ARF survivors. However, providing
reliable PSBPS intervention is a challenge for busy ICU clinicians. Doulas, trained lay health care providers
who provide emotional support to women in labor have been identified as a reliable yet affordable alternative.
Given common elements of their services and our intervention, doulas are in an ideal position to administer
PSBPS. The objective of this project is to refine and test a behavioral intervention to be administered in
parallel with medical treatment in the ICU. This will be accomplished through two specific aims, which are: 1)
to complete the pilot PSBPS with trained doulas and to refine the intervention based on stakeholder feedback
and 2) to conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the potential efficacy of PSBPS vs usual care in
ARF patients on mental health morbidity and cognitive outcomes. In AIM 1, PSBPS will be performed on 30
ARF patients with subsequent semi-structured interviews of all involved stakeholders; patients will also
complete anxiety, depression, acute stress/PTSD, and cognitive function evaluation as measured by validated
instruments. For AIM 2, we will conduct a randomized, controlled trial to test the effectiveness of PSBPS. We
hypothesize that ARF patients who receive standardized EPSCI will have fewer symptoms of anxiety,
depression and acute stress/PTSD at ICU discharge and at 6-month follow-up, and better cognitive function.
The proposed Career Development Award supports the NHLBI mission by striving to improve outcomes in
ARF patients while training a junior investigator in essential skills to become an independent researcher."

The long-term goal of this project is to develop better therapies for respiratory inflammation and allergic
asthma. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) are a recently identified cell population producing type 2
cytokines in response to a growing number of environmental signals and epithelial cell-derived cytokines.
Studies show increased ILC2 activity in asthma and many widespread diseases, as ILC2s are sufficient to
induce airway inflammation independent of adaptive immunity in mice. The proposed research plan is
motivated by recent new observations from our laboratory and others that the TNF/TNFR2 axis controls ILC2-
dependent airway inflammation (Cell Report 2019, J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2020). High levels of TNF are
found in the lungs of asthmatic patients, however anti-TNF therapy is generally associated with systemic
toxicity due to the existence of two distinct functionally different receptors for TNF: TNFR1 and TNFR2. Our
results suggest that TNF enhanced the secretion of ILC2 effector cytokines IL-5 and IL-13 and increased
survival via TNFR2 signaling, leading to airway inflammation. However, how the TNF/TNFR2 axis
mechanistically affects ILC2s and subsequent development of airway inflammation remains to be explored.
Based on our data, we hypothesize that blocking TNFR2 on ILC2s induces an immunoregulatory phenotype
fueling on a distinct metabolic source, together favoring the reduction of AHR. In Specific Aim 1 (SA1), we
have designed several approaches to characterize the effects of TNF on ILC2 effector functions and lung
inflammation. Our preliminary data suggest that TNFR2 is heterogeneously expressed on activated ILC2s. We
will therefore characterize the transcription factors driving the effects of TNF in ILC2s using a combination of
single cell genomic and transcriptomic analysis. Furthermore, data from our laboratory and others suggest that
metabolic processes in ILC2s are dependent on the generation of energy from fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and
oxidative phosphorylation. Interestingly our results clearly show a metabolic shift towards glycolysis in TNFR2-/-
ILC2s. Based on these results we intend to assess glycolysis and FAO mechanisms in WT and TNFR2-/- ILC2s
in SA2. Finally, we previously showed that human ILC2s express TNFR2 and humanized ILC2 mice developed
TNFR2-dependent AHR in response to TNF. Therefore, we intend to assess in the SA3 the relevance of our
findings in asthmatic patients. We will collect lung and blood ILC2s from carefully selected cohorts of
mild/moderate, severe asthmatics and healthy donors and correlate the levels of TNF in the BAL to the
numbers of ILC2s/expression of TNFR2, as well as monitor other cells that express TNFR2. These studies,
based on strong preliminary data, will focus on developing novel therapy for allergic asthma. In order to
achieve these results we have assembled a team including leading experts in lung biology and the chief of
clinical pulmonology to complement our extensive experience in pre-clinical models."

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is widespread and infection results in syndromes ranging from asymptomatic
latency to life-threatening sepsis due to reactivation of a latent infection in immunocompromised individuals. One
major, yet often overlooked, consequence of HCMV infection in immunosuppressed patients is CMV retinitis
(CMVR). Given its ubiquitous nature, risk of visual complications including blindness, and cost associated with
diagnosis and therapy, HCMV, the causative agent of CMVR, is a crucial target for investigation to advance
knowledge and develop effective therapeutic strategies. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) has been impli-
cated as a point of entry for viruses, including HCMV, into the neural layer of the retina. The single-step HCMV
lytic replication cycle has an approximately 96 h duration in vitro in fibroblasts that culminates in production of
infectious virions and destruction of the infected cell. It is known that HCMV infection of adult RPE (ARPE19)
cells leads to a slower, less destructive persistent infection and multi-step replication. Computational modeling
is a methodological advancement that has only been recently applied to the study of the dynamic profiling of
some viral proteins in single-step replication, and there are very few multi-step replication models that exist, likely
due to a lack of a readily testable in vitro persistence-like system, thus creating two related knowledge gaps. The
objective of this fellowship is to provide training that integrates wet-lab and computational strategies to study
complex visual pathologies using HCMV lytic replication kinetics and CMVR as a model system. The goals of
this fellowship are to: (1) identify and computationally model the effects of varying multiplicity of infection (MOI)
and cell type (i.e., fibroblast vs. ARPE19) on HCMV replication kinetics during single-step replication; (2) develop
an in vitro model system similar to a persistent HCMV infection employing multi-step replication in ARPE19 cells;
and (3) experimentally investigate and computationally simulate the effects of the anti-HCMV drug ganciclovir
(GCV) on the novel persistence-like in vitro system using ARPE19 cells. In Aim 1, I will use a bottom-up, bio-
chemically-based, MOI-dependent computational model to describe the protein interactions and regulation in
single-step lytic HCMV replication. I will investigate cell type-dependent variability by comparing models param-
eterized using MRC5 fibroblast-derived data and ARPE19 cell-derived data. In Aim 2, I will use a top-down
approach to computationally model the effects of multi-step HCMV replication in ARPE19 cells at the cellular
level using a novel, in vitro persistence-like system and a target-cell limited model. I will generate an in vitro
persistence-like system using ARPE19 cells infected at a low MOI, allowing for multi-step replication, to achieve
a steady-state level of viral DNA (vDNA). I will correlate this system’s response to the anti-HCMV drug GCV with
the predictions from extant target-cell limited models that were parameterized using patient data. Finally, I will
use the target-cell limited model to predict the optimal in vitro GCV treatment duration causing vDNA levels to
decay below the qPCR limit of detection and then test this using the novel persistence-like system."

Bone metastatic disease correlates with increased morbidity and mortality in prostate cancer (PCa) patients.
Various studies, including our own, have determined that the bone marrow niche plays a supportive role during
metastatic progression, which leads to increased tumor cell survival and escape from therapy, but the molecular
mechanisms are not fully understood. Our previous studies have highlighted adipocytes, an abundant cell type
in the bone marrow, as key modulators of tumor cell energetics and contributors to their aggressive phenotype.
We have demonstrated that adipocyte-supplied lipids, released upon adipocyte-tumor cell crosstalk, induce pro-
survival phenotype and promote ER and oxidative stress activation as potential cell adaptation mechanisms in
PCa cells. My new preliminary data have now uncovered novel molecular consequences of tumor cell-adipocyte
crosstalk, including the following: 1) Activation of an adaptive response to lipid peroxidation in PCa cells is
mediated by adipocyte-supplied lipids; 2) Augmented expression of ER stress gene, ATF4, and lipid desaturation
enzyme, SCD, in PCa cells is a possible defense mechanism against damaging effects of lipid peroxidation; 3)
ER stress gene, ATF4, plays a potential role in regulating SCD levels and activity in PCa cells grown under lipid-
rich conditions; and 4) Adipocyte-supplied lipids are likely involved in regulating the tumor metabolome.
Stemming from these findings, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that adipocyte activation of the ATF4-
SCD axis modulates tumor metabolism to promote the survival of PCa in bone.
I propose a multi-faceted approach that includes cell culture and mouse models of lipolysis, in vivo models of
intratibial tumor growth, as well as state-of-the-art RNAseq and metabolomics approaches to determine the role
of previously unexplored ATF4-SCD axis in regulating tumor metabolism and promoting progression in bone.
These studies will be performed in two aims. In Aim 1, I will utilize mice deficient in lipolysis and create human
and murine PCa cells with stable knockdown of ATF4 to study the role of adipocyte-supplied lipids in modulating
the ATF4-ER stress response pathway to promote progression in bone. In Aim 2, I will focus on the ATF4-SCD
interaction and utilize RNA-seq and metabolomics approaches to determine how lipid-mediated activation of this
axis alters tumor metabolome. Altogether, the results of this study will be used to delineate key molecular
mechanisms by which metastatic PCa cells engage ATF4 and SCD to survive in the lipid-rich bone marrow. This
work will also likely reveal potential novel options for targeting tumor metabolism for improved therapy and/or
prevention of aggressive disease. This proposed work will have broad implications for numerous cancer types
that metastasize to bone or those that arise from bone and are likely to be affected by the bone marrow adipose
tissue."

 Human oral polymicrobial communities play a significant role in health and disease. Periodontitis is a
polymicrobial disease and is among the most common infections of humans. Recent next-generation sequencing
studies reveal that periodontal polymicrobial communities are comprised of a large diversity of bacterial species;
however, we have little to no understanding of the disease-role of some of the key members. Saccharibacteria
(TM7) is one such bacterial group that has been linked to multiple inflammatory diseases, including periodontitis.
In addition, TM7 belongs to a major bacterial lineage termed Candidate Phyla Radiation. Candidate Phyla
Radiation encompasses one-quarter of all bacterial diversity, yet they have been recalcitrant to laboratory
cultivation. Oral TM7 bacteria were the first to be cultivated, opening the door to many intriguing questions due
to their unique characteristics. TM7 has an ultra-small cell size (200-500 nm) with a highly reduced genome
lacking essential biological functions. More importantly, it is an epiparasitic bacteria that grows on the surface of
Actinobacteria (i.e., Actinomyces, Pseudopropionibacterium), which is another understudied bacterial group in
humans. Actinomyces has been shown to induce inflammatory response both in cultured cells and in animal
models. Our preliminary mouse periodontal studies were designed to investigate the role of TM7 and its host
bacteria, Actinomyces, in vivo. TM7/host bacteria pairs induced less inflammatory bone loss compared to host
bacteria alone, suggesting that oral Actinomyces and related bacteria can be a pathobiont (opportunistic
pathogen), and their pathogenicity is regulated by TM7 bacteria. The current proposal will investigate pathogenic
genes in TM7 host bacteria and how they are regulated by TM7 bacteria via metatranscriptomics. Identified
genes will be further tested by site-directed mutagenesis in the host bacteria (Aim 1). The proposal will also
determine the pathogenic and immunostimulatory activity of TM7 bacteria in epithelial and immune cell
interaction assay and will identify TM7 macromolecules that are involved in their interaction with the eukaryotic
cells (Aim 2). Lastly, this study will expand to culturing and characterizing additional taxonomically diverse TM7
bacteria from the periodontal patients, effectively creating a library of TM7 bacteria. This will allow us to determine
the general immunological behavior of TM7/host bacteria across different TM7 species (Aim 3). Accomplishment
of the proposal aims will improve the currently limited understanding of TM7 bacteria and its interaction with the
host bacteria, as well as generate the first understanding of TM7's role in periodontal and inflammatory diseases."
10754868,"Mechanisms that create, maintain, and modulate synapses are essential building blocks of human behavior.
Disruptions to these mechanisms are inextricably linked to aberrant behavior and diseases ranging from
depression and schizophrenia to addiction and Alzheimer’s Disease. Thus, the long-term goal of this grant is to
pursue a deep understanding of the molecular organization underlying synaptic transmission and plasticity.
Our previous work took advantage of the extremely high-resolution enabled by single-molecule imaging
methods and determined that at glutamatergic synapses, key proteins in the active zone and the postsynaptic
density are enriched in subsynaptic nanodomains (<100 nm). Most surprisingly, nanodomains of the critical
fusion-regulatory proteins RIM and Munc13 in the presynaptic active zone align with high precision across the
synaptic cleft from nanodomains enriched in postsynaptic glutamate receptors. Using single-vesicle fusion
mapping, we determined that the local density of RIM within active zone subregions predicts the probability of
action potential-evoked vesicle fusion. This striking architectural arrangement has important implications for
how synapses function. This nano-alignment between release sites and receptors can modulate synaptic
transmission and potentially influence intracellular signaling. Preliminary data here and published work from
others establishes that transsynaptic nanoalignment is an important element of synaptic architecture, widely
present in diverse synapse types. Further, our data provide firm evidence that subsynaptic nanostructure and
nanoalignment are dynamically modulated during synaptic plasticity and actively maintained by ongoing
molecular interactions. These observations strongly motivate understanding the mechanisms involved in
creating and maintaining transsynaptic alignment. Therefore, we will test a set of related but independent
hypotheses about the origin and maintenance of transsynaptic nanoalignment. We will test 1) whether two key
neurexin partners, neuroligin and LRRTM, cooperate to provide the structural basis of transsynaptic alignment,
2) whether glutamate receptors themselves are necessary or sufficient to influence the nanoscale protein
organization of the active zone 3), whether the active zone RIM complex conveys instructive information to
establish postsynaptic nanopatterning, and 4) how the actin cytoskeleton exerts ongoing control over synapse
nanoscale architecture. To answer these questions, we have worked to establish and apply several new
broadly useful technologies. We utilize a new super-resolution imaging methodology to visualize cellular
substructure at nanometer resolution in vivo, apply multiplexed single-molecule imaging to map numerous
proteins in the same sample, and develop new optical and biochemical tools to acutely control the actin
cytoskeleton, adhesion complexes, and receptor distribution with high spatiotemporal resolution and in brain
slices. The outcomes of these experiments will answer core questions about the genesis of an important new
aspect of synaptic architecture and test the physiological role of synaptic nanoalignment in brain circuits."

STIRRUP (STI Responses and Recommendations Under PrEP) combines big data streams with mathemat-
ical modeling and economic decision science to understand the optimal design of STI screening in PrEP care.
Cases of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis have increased substantially over the past decade and a dispro-
portionate disease burden falls on men who have sex with men (MSM). The persistently high STI rates among
MSM are driven by the high proportion of asymptomatic infections and low rates of routine screening that
would detect these infections. Most MSM who use PrEP are at elevated risk of acquiring STIs. PrEP care
therefore provides a critical opportunity to reach and clinically engage a population who could benefit from
linked HIV and STI prevention services. Screening for STIs in PrEP care following CDC recommendations can
counterbalance the effects of increases in sexual risk behavior by treating asymptomatic STIs to prevent ongo-
ing STI transmission chains. However, patterns of STI screening in PrEP care are far from recommended
levels, with substantial variation by demographics and geography. Models informing clinical practice and public
health policy must therefore incorporate data streams that span the range of healthcare settings where PrEP
care is offered to these groups, and where it can be improved. Following an Extended, Multi-Disease PrEP
Continuum of Care that includes steps for STI ancillary services and PrEP retention, we seek to test a leading
hypothesis about the bidirectionality of these two steps: that ongoing comprehensive PrEP care is an efficient
mechanism for routine STI screening and treatment, but that frequent STI ancillary services may often be a
burden to retention in PrEP care. STIRRUP includes three SPECIFIC AIMS: AIM 1. We will extract, collect,
analyze, and synthesize information on PrEP care, sexual behavior, mental health diagnoses, and HIV/STI
screening patterns for MSM from electronic health records and epidemiological studies in three types of PrEP
programs (academic, public, and private) in two geographic settings (Boston and Atlanta) distinguished by their
HIV/STI burden and demographics. Analyses will guide development of an ethical framework for big data in
modeling. AIM 2. With these data, we will build network-based race-stratified transmission models of four co-
circulating infections (HIV, chlamydia, syphilis, and gonorrhea) among MSM at three exposure sites (urogeni-
tal, rectal, and pharyngeal). These models will investigate the relationship between PrEP use and HIV/STI
incidence given current bacterial STI screening/treatment (pre- and post-PrEP initiation), with a theory-driven
focus on racial/ethnic disparities and mental health predictors across and within each city. AIM 3. We will eval-
uate public health policies and clinical practice strategies for screening and treatment of STIs among
heterogenous groups of MSM using PrEP. Economic models will estimate the cost-effectiveness of policies
individualized to clinical histories, and evaluate the optimal approach to targeting societal resources to reduce
out-of-pocket user costs for ancillary PrEP services that could improve long-term PrEP retention."
10749031,"Stroke is a major cause of disability in veterans. Despite significant advances in stroke rehabilitation
methods there continue to be substantial long-term disability. Importantly, quantitative assessments
have found that a major contributor to motor impairments is the presence of fragmented movement
control, characterized by a lack of smooth and fast transitions between sub-movements and
inconsistency over multiple attempts. Furthermore, there is a deficit in learning new movement
sequences. It remains unclear what is the precise circuit basis for such deficits.
The central hypothesis of this proposal is that impaired task-dependent recruitment of the
striatum contributes to fragmented movement control and poor learning. There has been a great
focus on the role of perilesional cortex (PLC) in recovery. In the intact brain, however, cortical areas
work in close concert with subcortical regions; interactions between M1 and the dorsolateral striatum
(DLS) are known to play a critical role in learning and generating smooth and consistent skilled
movements. Little is known about how the DLS might contribute to motor recovery after stroke. Our
preliminary data shows that coordination between M1 and DLS is directly linked to “binding” of movement
fragments to result in a smooth and fast skilled action. We further found that DLS is essential for such
execution; inhibition of DLS increased movement fragmentation. Our data also demonstrates that DLS
activity is affected by stroke and that its activity changes with recovery.
We propose to pursue the following specific aims: 1) Determine the role of task-related oscillatory activity
in the DLS in regulating movement fragmentation during spontaneous motor recovery after cortical
stroke; 2) Determine the role of low-frequency coherence between areas during spontaneous recovery
in the setting of a stroke that involves both cortex and striatum; 3) Determine if paired stimulation can
increase coordination and thereby improve motor outcomes. Completion of these aims will provide
critical information for designing therapeutic approaches that specifically target cortico-striatal activity.
Focusing on targeted neuromodulation of such dynamic neural network interactions represents a new
direction that could transform our ability to augment recovery of upper extremity function following stroke."

Epidemiological and clinical studies support an important role of nutrition in health. However, nutrition research
is limited by bias due to self-reported diet data and inter- and intra-individual variation. High-throughput `omic'
profiling techniques combined with advanced remote real-time data collection now enable comprehensive
studies of individual responses to diet thereby creating opportunities for personalized nutrition advice.
Our overall goal is to facilitate the Nutrition for Precision Health (NPH) Consortium by leveraging our existing
Illinois Precision Medicine Consortium (IPMC) infrastructure to enroll All of Us Research Program (AoURP)
participants in the discovery nutrition science study involving three diet modules. Proposed is investigation of
specific elements of a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet with blood pressure (BP) as the
primary outcome. BP is regulated by a complex network of mechanisms under the influence of genetic and
environmental factors, and high BP is recognized as the leading modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular
disease, cerebrovascular disease, kidney disease and all-cause mortality worldwide. DASH diet adherence
has consistently documented reduced BP, independent of baseline calorie or sodium intake. Although older,
hypertensive and Black persons show greater BP responses to DASH adherence and reduced dietary sodium
intake, inter-individual variability is observed and remains unexplained. In Module 1, we will follow 2,000
AoURP participants for 14 days to examine baseline diet and physiological responses to test-meal challenges
hypothesized to elicit variable physiological and metabolomic responses based on individual cardiometabolic,
genetic and gut microbial status. We then examine responses to three 14-day intervention periods involving
DASH-type diets among 400 consenting Module 1 participants in a free-living controlled feeding study (Module
2) and in 200 Module 1 participants in a domicile controlled feeding study (Module 3). The three intervention
diets are isocaloric, sodium equivalent and include: i) DASH-Standard, ii) DASH-FFF, specifying fruits,
flavonoids and fat and DASH-PP, emphasizing plant protein. Each diet has distinctive nutritive properties that
influence BP regulation and each will elucidate diverse physiological, metabolomic, and microbiomic responses
that are modified by cardiometabolic and genetic status. Our three IPMC clinical sites including Northwestern
University, the University of Chicago, and the Illinois Institute of Technology span wide yet geographically
distinct service areas in ethnically and socioeconomically diverse Chicago communities, thereby offering
targeted enrollment of demographically diverse participants.
This research in collaboration with the NPH consortium initiates fundamental causal and mechanistic insight
into the role of the DASH-type diet in BP regulation with potential to discover novel biological pathways
underlying risks for developing high BP. This advanced knowledge can inform unprecedented personalized
diet recommendations to prevent and treat the massive public health burden off hypertension."

The Center for the AIDS Program of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA) CASCADE Clinical Trials Network
Clinical Research Site, aims to provide clinical trial infrastructure and operational leadership for the conduct
of pragmatic clinical trials through the CASCADE Clinical Trials Network. The proposed clinical trial site is
strategically located in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) province, the epicentre of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus
(HIV) epidemic in South Africa. Due to the high background HIV prevalence in this setting, KZN province
remains a region with a high burden of cervical cancer disease, despite expansion and improved access to
antiretroviral treatment (ART).
 CAPRISA has been undertaking high-impact globally relevant and locally responsive research for
nearly two decades. The Ethekwini Clinical Research Site (ECRS) is one of four clinical research sites and
is based in the central business district in Ethekwini. This is a well-established research site, with over 15
years’ experience conducting high-quality clinical trials. We have established research infrastructure which
supports the conduct of both CAPRISA-led research as well as National Institutes of Health (NIH) network-
affiliated trials, primarily recruiting young women for participation in our trials. To date, our core focus of
research has been HIV prevention, although we are equally experienced in research involving HIV
pathogenesis and clinical management of women living with HIV (WLHIV). Together with previous Human
Papilloma Virus (HPV) epidemiological studies undertaken by our team, we have begun preliminary work in
cervical cancer screening in an ongoing CAPRISA trial, where we are evaluating HPV point-of-care testing
in WLHIV.
 Through the CASCADE network we aim to support and advance cervical cancer prevention, through
participation in clinical trials. Through our relevant clinical trial experience and scientific expertise, we are
able to contribute to the four scientific focus areas proposed by the network: increasing screening uptake,
improving management of screen positives, facilitating precancer treatment access and optimising precancer
treatment for cervical cancer prevention in WLHIV. We have assembled a strong team of investigators to
support this program, including a Principal Investigator (PI) and Co-Investigators who have led multiple HIV
and COVID-19 clinical trials at a site level and are leading several NIH-funded protocols as national PIs or
protocol co-Chairs. The team are able to contribute to protocol development and to provide laboratory, data
management and statistical support for trials undertaken through the network. Furthermore, we are able to
collaborate with the respective research bases and coordinating centers proposed by the network.
Considering CAPRISA’s expertise in HIV research and preliminary work undertaken in HPV epidemiology
and HPV diagnostics, we are well-placed to be a strong partner in the CASCADE network."
10890618,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
During pregnancy, maternal and extraembryonic cells interact at the uterine-placental interface, facilitating
adaptations that promote fetal growth. Trophoblast stem (TS) cells differentiate and invade into the uterus
during pregnancy. When invasive trophoblast cells fail to invade and remodel the uterine spiral arteries this
leads to obstetrical complications such as early pregnancy loss, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction,
and preterm birth. There is little known about the mechanisms of invasive trophoblast cell lineage
development. The long-term goal of our research is to identify conserved regulators of invasive trophoblast cell
lineage development and its contributions to diseases of pregnancy. We utilize the rat model because like the
human it exhibits deep intrauterine trophoblast cell invasion, unlike the shallow invasion observed in the
mouse. We also use human TS cells that can be manipulated to differentiate into invasive trophoblast cells,
which are known as extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cells in the human. Human TS are a useful model for
investigating molecular mechanisms regulating trophoblast cell differentiation. To identify candidate regulators
of the invasive trophoblast cell lineage, our lab performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of the rat
uterine-placental interface. We identified follistatin-like 3 (FSTL3) as a conserved transcript uniquely
expressed in invasive trophoblast cells of the rat and human. FSTL3 is an antagonist of activin signaling.
Evidence exists for activin and FSTL3 involvement in the regulation of trophoblast cell proliferation, survival,
migration, and invasion. In Aim1, we will utilize loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches to investigate
the involvement of activin and FSTL3 in the regulation of human TS cell differentiation into the EVT cell
lineage. We will examine structural, transcriptomic, and functional processes affected by activin-FSTL3
dysregulation. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the role of FSTL3 in development of the invasive trophoblast cell
lineage within the rat hemochorial placenta. We have generated an FSTL3 null rat model using CRISPR/ Cas9
genome editing. These experiments will permit analysis of the regulatory role of FSTL3 in a physiological
context. This project will be completed at the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC) under the guidance
of Dr. Michael J Soares and a mentoring team of outstanding scientists. A training plan has been formulated to
facilitate the development of technical proficiencies and critical thinking skills necessary to devise and execute
experimentation that effectively addresses a meaningful biological question. The Soares Laboratory, the
Institute for Reproductive and Developmental Sciences, and the Department of Pathology and Laboratory
Medicine at KUMC represent a rich scientific environment that will provide the applicant with outstanding
graduate training and a research opportunity to gain fundamental new insights into the regulation of female
fertility."

 Despite serious pregnancy complications, 50% of women who use tobacco products will continue to do
so during pregnancy. A recent 2017 study estimates as many women use electronic-cigarettes (e-cigs) as
conventional cigarettes during pregnancy. One major reason for this alarming data is that traditional tobacco
users view vaping during pregnancy as a “safer” alternative. However, e-cig vapor reveals a myriad of
chemicals which may be harmful to both the mother and the fetus.
 Using our well-established pregnant rat model, we obtained preliminary data utilizing a state-of-the-art
custom-engineered e-cig atomizer that offered a translational inhalation delivery method and generated vapor
profiles directly comparable to human vaping. The preliminary data demonstrated e-cig-induced major fetal
growth deficit and provides the first evidence for impaired gestational circulatory adaptations including uterine
blood flow, the prime regulator of gas and nutrient delivery from mother to fetus. Aim#1 will test if vaping e-cig
base (varying ratios of propylene glycol: glycerol) alone or with increasing doses of nicotine produce a dose-
dependent effect on uterine blood flow (UBF) and fetal growth response. Further, we will test if there are e-cig-
induced systemic cardiovascular adaptations during pregnancy. We will assess maternal reproductive
vascular, and e-cig-induced fetal cardiovascular adaptations, accompanied by effects on the pulmonary system
utilizing high frequency ultrasonography, flexiVent, TTE, ECG, Luminex xMAP technology, and surgical
catheterization for blood pressure and microsphere-based flow assessment. Aim#2 will test if vaping e-cig will
impair uterine artery relaxation via the endothelium-derived NO vs. EDHF vs. PGI2 pathways (the three
vasodilators that entirely regulate primary uterine artery blood flow in pregnancy). We will pharmacologically
block combinations of endothelial-derived vasodilator pathways using pressure arteriography, and dissect
impaired cell signaling utilizing HPLC, histological approaches, immunoblotting, and other molecular tools.
 Our proposal explores a new frontier of gestational research developing the first mechanistic framework
for e-cig vaping-induced uterine circulatory adaptations in a model that offers a translational inhalation delivery
and vapor profiles comparable to human vaping. The proposed studies on the health effects of e-cigs during
pregnancy will facilitate applicable policy implementation on potential risks these devices pose to the public.
Proposed studies directly address a key consensus recommendation of the most recent NIH/NHLBI workshop
on cardiovascular disease and the emergence of e-cigs, i.e. investigating effects of e-cigarette aerosol
exposure in pregnant women."
10754545,"Project Summary – Applied Research Project
Our cell-depleting antibody resource has expanded greatly in antibody quantity, quality, and diversity over the
past 15 years. We are now proposing to use a new applied research approach to refine our resource, by
identifying genotypes associated with therapy effectiveness. Success in cell-depletion treatments is determined
by the antibody’s ability to engage with its ligand and trigger effector mechanisms. When either of these functions
is suboptimal the patient might present a partial or no depletion. In humans, differential response to therapeutic
cell-depleting monoclonal antibodies has been associated with specific polymorphisms in Fc gamma receptors.
Indeed, Fc receptors (FcR) and antibody target gene biomarkers are currently used to identify patients who are
predicted to respond to the targeted agents. While most of our animals respond to cell-depletion treatments, it is
often the case that one or two animals (~10%) in a given experiment will not have efficient depletion levels.
Because the mechanisms underlying the lack of therapy success are undetermined, neither can the investigators
pre-screen study animals nor can we design antibodies that overcome this barrier. For best use of our cell-
depleting resources, therefore, we are proposing to identify genetic associations of target and immune effector
genes with cell-depletion treatment success. Our preliminary data suggest a differential distribution of common
FcR alleles in animals with inefficient vs efficient cell depletion. We will use a candidate gene case-control
association study that is sufficiently powered (n= 220-250) to identify genetic markers that correlate with
treatment outcomes. The identification of biomarkers that are predictive of efficacious depletion would have an
immediate impact on our resource, by allowing researchers to screen animals prior to study or treatment
initiation. Importantly, this information can be used to take corrective actions and improve treatment performance,
by either excluding poor responders or modifying therapy regimens. During the course of the next cell-depleting
program cycle, the genetic variant data will also be used to guide the design of broadly functional antibodies
against common target variants. Finally, in the long term, this information will be used to design a new generation
of rhesus antibodies with high affinity to commonly expressed FcRs. In summary, are proposing to identify
relevant polymorphisms by sequencing genes encoding the target ligands of our antibodies or Fc receptors from
animals with divergent cell depletion outcomes. This will improve our resource by 1) generating biomarkers
associated with cell depleting therapy efficacy; 2) guiding the development of antibodies that will recognize most
common target variants; and, in the long term, 3) lead to the development of a new generation of rhesus
antibodies with a superior recognition by commonly expressed FcRs."

Sensory systems have evolved to help meet the behavioral needs of organisms to ensure survival. Across the
animal kingdom, two sensory functions are paramount: first, to identify specific objects in the environment and
endow them with salience; and second, to move closer to objects of desire and away from objects that are best
avoided. These properties – identification and localization – are the “what” and “where” questions of sensory
information processing, respectively, and each of the senses provides a unique snapshot of the world that
complements the other senses. In the unique case of olfaction, orthonasal and retronasal olfactory channels
ensure that odor sources can be identified and tracked with fidelity at distal, proximate, and intraoral distances.
This proposed project will focus on the “where” question of information processing in the human olfactory
system. In particular, we aim to understand the capacities, constraints, and mechanisms by which odor cues
orient and steer a navigator in the right direction. In this regard, a singular aspect of odors is their ability to
travel through the air over long distances, such that the olfactory system can gather valuable predictive
information not only about the physical location of an odorous source, but also about the navigator’s position
within a physical landscape. Critically, while elegant neurobiological studies on odor navigation have been
conducted in insects and birds, basic research on this topic in mammals, including humans, is sparse.
Our planned studies are inspired by groundbreaking experiments showing that different types of neurons can
encode and map physical spaces, including “place cells” (representing specific locations in space) and “grid
cells” (representing an internal coordinate system to self-orient in this space). Here we will use functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), virtual reality (VR) techniques, and computational methods to determine
whether we can infer the presence of “grid-like” fMRI responses when human subjects navigate through an
odor-rich two-dimensional landscape. In Aim 1, subjects will be asked to navigate a VR arena in which the only
informative sensory cues are olfactory, enabling us to test whether subjects can learn the spatial relational
positions among a set of odors, and whether grid-like responses arise during odor navigation. Aim 2 will test
the stability of olfactory grid-like responses by assessing whether contextual changes in the VR arena induce
remapping of olfactory cognitive maps. Aim 3 will test the behavioral limits of human olfactory navigation by
progressively peeling away all remaining visual cues in the arena. Together these studies should bring
fundamental understanding to the capacities and constraints of human olfactory navigation, and should
highlight neural mechanisms underlying the “where” question of human olfaction, and more broadly, how the
olfactory system tracks and locates odor sources in odiferous environments."

Mass incarceration of individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) is a public health and human rights crisis.
Not since the mid-nineteenth century has the criminal justice system played such a large role in how American
society responds to mental illness. Since the late 1960s researchers have noted ever-rising numbers of jail
inmates with SMI, often caught in a ""revolving door"" of hospitalization, homelessness, and arrest. Incarceration
is one of the most visible (and traumatic) moments of contact with the public system, and provides a window
into the failures of the public mental health system. Our long-term objective is to inform and rigorously evaluate
policy and interventions that seek to reduce law enforcement response to mental illness and end the mass
incarceration of individuals with SMI. In line with NIMH Strategic Objectives 4.1B and 4.2, this R34 proposal
furthers the development of a real-world data collection system to facilitate research and ongoing monitoring
related to access, service continuity, equity, and outcomes such as incarceration and homelessness in diverse
populations and settings. Our research approach is to leverage a regularly-updated Los Angeles County (LAC)
county-wide administrative database, which links individuals across 8 public agencies from 2010 to the
present, for research around incarceration and SMI. In partnership with LAC administrators/providers and non-
LAC researchers, we will develop and test this database through algorithm development and validation,
exploration of mental health service patterns leading up to incarceration, and testing of the algorithms and
dataset using a pilot evaluation of mental health crisis interventions in lieu of law enforcement response, in
preparation for an R01 proposal to evaluate the effects of policies and interventions that shift resources from
criminal justice to new and existing mental health services. LAC as our study site allows for a particularly in-
depth look because of its size (population>10 million) and diversity across a number of critical divides:
urban/rural; racial; economic; cultural; and resource availability. Our specific aims are as follows: Aim 1:
Develop algorithms for sample ascertainment and operationalization of key measures to enable the study of
criminal justice contact and diversion programs among underserved populations with SMI. Aim 2: Validate and
refine these algorithms through formal validation methods and in consultation with our partners. Aim 3: Test the
feasibility of research using the linked dataset and algorithms by asking what types of service patterns precede
incarceration of individuals with SMI and how these patterns differ across geographic and demographic
subgroups, and by conducting a pilot evaluation of alternative crisis response interventions: who receives
them, what their service patterns look like before and after the crisis service, how this differs between clients
who receive a new mental health-only 911-dispatched service vs. a joint law enforcement-mental health crisis
intervention team service, and how this compares to similar clients who had a police contact leading to arrest."
10841609,"Fear learning allows animals to detect and defend themselves from dangerous situations by forming a memory
that links stimuli encountered during trauma with the experience of physical or psychological harm. Conversely,
the primary mechanism through which these behaviors are constrained is through extinction, in which repeated
re-exposure to conditioned stimuli without aversive consequences attenuates fear. Research suggests that
extinction forms a new memory of safety that competes with the original fear association during memory recall.
However, while deficits at the recall stage are a major factor in pathological fear, the circuit mechanisms
underlying extinction recall and how they might differentiate between competing fear and extinction memories
remain largely enigmatic. This is a fundamental knowledge gap that limits insight into extinction and the potential
reasons for its failure in psychiatric disorders. In this project we hypothesize that an important mechanism in
context fear extinction is recruitment of somatostatin interneurons in the ventral hippocampus, and that these
cells control switching between competing context representations, one signaling threat and the other safety. In
support of this hypothesis, we find that somatostatin interneurons are preferentially activated by an extinguished
context and their manipulation modulates fear expression in this context but not others. Using a combination of
intersectional genetics, electrophysiology, optogenetics and calcium imaging, we will investigate the properties
and function of discrete populations of somatostatin interneurons underlying context-dependent behavior. In
particular, we will examine whether these cells control transitions between high and low fear states and elucidate
the mechanisms underlying this switch at the level of excitatory neuronal populations involved in fear and
extinction memory. Successful completion of these aims will shed light on how the brain governs conflicting
internal models of an ambiguous environment as well as provide a detailed account of circuit dynamics that
promote the loss of fear and prevent it from reemerging."

 Aortic aneurysm disease ranks consistently in the top 20 causes of death in the U.S.
population. Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) is a leading cause of death in adults. The progression
of TAA is a silent process, yet rupture/dissection can occur suddenly, which often causes death.
The deadly events are preventable by elective surgical repair, and the current criterion for surgical
intervention states that surgery should be performed when TAA maximum diameter reaches 5 to
5.5 cm. However, this criterion cannot assess the risk of smaller TAAs (diameter≤5cm). It is
estimated that there are millions of TAA patients in the U.S. with smaller TAAs, and these patients
are unfortunately ignored by the current criterion. Thus, in this project, we propose an innovative
approach of integrating machine learning (ML) and computational biomechanics for risk
assessment of smaller TAAs. To achieve this goal, we will develop (1) ML models for automated
thoracic aorta geometry reconstruction from 3D clinical CT images, which will enable a fast and
streamlined analysis of TAA risk, (2) ML models for realtime TAA stress analysis, and (3) a
probabilistic risk index that fuses the measured and computed patient characteristics (e.g.
geometry, stress, material strength, etc) and takes into account uncertainties from different
sources. The proposed approach will be developed and validated on an existing dataset of 1000
patients and a new dataset to be assembled from a longitudinal follow-up study of 600 patients,
which will be the first large-scale study of machine learning-based biomechanical analysis for TAA
risk assessment. This study will lead to a breakthrough in the fields of cardiovascular
computational modeling and applied machine learning, provide new insights on how to better
assess TAA risk, and reduce death by the silent and sudden killer of TAA disease."

oxidative lipid damage in during ASH/NASH development. This aim will investigate lipid, oxidized
lipid and other derivatives, ROS production and their contribution to liver damage. The proposed
project will explore ERRα as a potential target for inhibiting and reversing fatty liver diseases. The
mechanistic and translations approaches will uncover novel biology for lipid metabolism as well
as test the therapeutic effect of a small molecule polyamide."

The immunology of pregnancy is complex and delicately balanced. While failure to tolerate fetal antigens
during pregnancy can result in fetal loss, ineffective immunity to pathogens can threaten the survival of both
the fetus and the mother. Fetal tissues and the maternal immune system continuously communicate to
maintain this balance. This proposal focuses on two understudied mechanisms of maternal-fetal
communication: extracellular vesicles (EVs) – lipid-bound particles carrying immunomodulatory proteins and
miRNAs secreted by cells, and maternal microchimeric cells (MMc) – the vertical transfer of maternal immune
cells to fetal organs. Specifically, we aim understand how these processes are influenced by normal microbial
experience to better understand their function during normal pregnancies. Much of what we know about EVs
and MMc during pregnancy has been discovered using conventional specific pathogen free (SPF) mouse
models, which have limited microbial diversity and are nearly devoid of pathogens. These artificially hygienic
conditions are in stark contrast to nature, where microbes are ubiquitous and diverse. Indeed, we and others
have demonstrated that the immune systems of mice raised under SPF conditions are underdeveloped relative
to humans and feral/pet store mice. We posit that the character and function of EVs and MMc in SPF
pregnancies are impaired by the lack of diverse microbial experience, thus reducing the predictive power of
SPF studies. Our lab has developed a preconception normal microbial experience (pNME) model whereby
laboratory mice are cohoused with pet store mice prior to breeding to naturally expose them to the diverse
microbial communities. Cohousing continues throughout gestation and early life, ensuring the offspring receive
‘mature’ maternal factors and encounter diverse microbes from the earliest natural time to replicate normal
mammalian immune development more accurately. Using this model, we have found that the immune systems
of pNME mice are broadly expanded and achieve immune developmental milestones earlier than SPF mice.
pNME mice also demonstrate enhanced survival and immune defense relative to SPF mice. The gap in
immunity between conventional SPF models and natural immune development has contributed to the slow
progress toward mechanistic understanding of maternal-fetal immune communication and fetal immune
development. The proposed research describes a natural model of immune development (pNME) that
combines the ample resources and tools of laboratory mouse strains with physiological microbial experience to
gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of normal maternal-fetal immune communication and their
influence on fetal immune development. Further, these experiments will lay the groundwork for improved
preclinical models investigating biomarkers, treatments, and preventions for immune pathologies during
pregnancy and early life."
10906988,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically changed the health outcomes of people with HIV (PWH). Newer
ART regimens with more robust viral suppression may allow complacency creep for imperfect adherence, given
the regimen forgiveness for achieving suppressed viral loads despite imperfect adherence. In turn, imperfect
adherence may lead to ongoing viral replication below the clinically-relevant suppression threshold, driving
inflammation and premature aging. Accumulating data indicate that underlying inflammation strongly contributes
to PWH continuing to develop non-communicable diseases (NCD) despite viral suppression, with studies
showing a 2-fold increased risk of a significant NCD, HIV-associated stroke, compared to people without HIV.
 HIV-associated stroke is associated with major mortality, morbidity, and healthcare economic burden. The
current investigators found a stroke prevalence of 6.2% in South African PWH with suppressed viral loads
compared to people without HIV. PWH were almost 10 years younger, had less traditional cardiovascular risk
factors, and were predominantly female, despite being virally suppressed to <200 copies/mL. Additionally, HIV
was found to be the predominant risk factor for young stroke (≤45 years) in a Malawian case-control study of
222 PWH and 503 population controls with acute stroke, with an adjusted odds ratio of 5.57 (2.43-12.8).
However, none of these studies examined imperfect adherence as a risk factor for stroke.
 Research on the treatment success of ART focuses primarily on perfect or near-perfect adherence strategies
to suppress HIV viral loads to below clinically-relevant thresholds, currently defined as <200 copies/mL. In clinical
practice, however, adherence to ART is often imperfect, with a cohort study from South Africa and Uganda
showing that despite most participants being classified as virally suppressed, adherence across several
categories of PWH was poor. This was confirmed in a study of 64 virally suppressed participants in whom 47%
had detectable viremia between 0-50 copies/mL despite adherence rates over the preceding two months of 93%
(82%-98%) using unannounced pill counts. Others have shown that lower concentrations of intracellular tenofovir
diphosphate (TFV-DP) on dried blood spots (DBS), an objective drug concentration biomarker indicating
cumulative adherence over the preceding 8 weeks, was associated with a 2-fold higher odds of viremia between
20-200 copies/mL.
 Investigating imperfect ART adherence in virally suppressed PWH with stroke offers an opportunity to gain
new insights into a potential modifiable factor to reduce stroke. This exploratory study will obtain important
preliminary data on the association between stroke and ART adherence, as well as the novel approach of testing
candidate proteomic biomarkers for the identification and prediction of stroke in virally suppressed PWH. We will
test the hypothesis that imperfect ART adherence sufficient to suppress HIV viral loads to <200 copies/mL
is insufficient to control viremia below this threshold, and is associated with inflammation leading to stroke."
10753123,"ROLE OF PERIPHERAL IMMUNE-DERIVED MMP8 IN STRESS SUSCEPTIBILITY
 In this application we will examine how peripheral monocytes interface with the brain to mediate stress
susceptibility (SUS) vs. resilience (RES). We and others have shown that stress mobilizes monocytes in the
periphery by enhancing their proliferation and egress from bone marrow stores into the circulation and the
trafficking them to target tissues, such as the brain. While we know that such effects have been linked to
alterations in complex stress-related behaviors, the mechanisms by which these immune cells communicate with
the brain has been largely unknown. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing along with advanced bioinformatics, we
first defined the cellular and molecular pathways that interface monocytes and the brain during chronic social
defeat stress (CSDS) exposure in mice. We find that CSDS increases matrix metalloproteinase 8 (MMP8)—a
monocyte-enriched matrix metalloproteinase that can remodel the tissue extracellular matrix (ECMs) and
promote blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability —in SUS, but not RES, mice. We further demonstrate that
peripheral MMP8 directly infiltrates the NAc parenchyma to control ECM reorganization. Depleting MMP8
specifically in peripheral immune cells prevented stress-induced social avoidance behavior and alterations in
NAc neurophysiology and extracellular matrix reorganization. Collectively, these data establish a novel
mechanism by which peripheral immune factors can affect central nervous system function and behavior in the
context of stress. Our team is now poised to exploit the many state-of-the-art tools in this application to gain a
fundamentally more complete understanding of how the peripheral immune system can interface with the brain
to control complex stress behaviors. First, we will define exactly how monocyte-derived MMP8 regulates the
BBB and ECM reorganization and cell-type specific neurophysiological changes in NAc. We will also define the
role of peripheral infiltration of MMP8 in NAc on social and non-social reward/reinforcement behaviors. Together
these studies will provide novel insight into the brain-body mechanisms that drive stress susceptibility, with the
ultimate goal of developing novel therapeutics targeting MMP8 to treat stress disorders."

This new R01 builds on discoveries during the R37 period (2008-2018) that established epigenetic mechanisms
(miRNAs, histone modifications) regulating osteoblast differentiation. We characterized for the first time a
“signature” of specific histone modifications that are associated with dynamic changes in gene expression during
the temporal progression of osteogenesis. These histone modifications also predicted “enhancers”, which are
critical cis-regulatory elements that contribute to local gene expression. We now propose to examine the recently
recognized “super enhancer” domains (SEDs) that include regulatory elements for multiple transcription factors
that have emerged as key regulators of cell phenotypes. SEDs function in chromatin organization via long range
intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions that coordinate control of gene cohorts responsible for lineage
specification and distinct cell identity. Our preliminary studies have identified a subset of SEDs that we now
propose are putative “bone-essential super-enhancers” and candidates for the important decision stage of
commitment to osteogenesis from MSCs. We hypothesize that super-enhancer domains are differentially
activated from the undifferentiated MSC to the osteoblast commitment stage, and function to establish the
osteogenic phenotype by coordinately regulating gene networks and contributing to higher order chromatin
organization that supports cell identity. Our studies will in: Aim1- analyze the functional effects of prioritized SEDs
we have identified related to osteoblastogenesis and mature bone activities through directed inhibition and
activation of SEDs using CRISPR/Cas9 in MSCs; Aim 2- determine the chromosomal domains that interact
with SEDs to control multiple genes and networks that commit MSCs to the osteoblast phenotype through
chromatin organization; and Aim 3- demonstrate in mouse models that using CRISPR activated SEDs in MSCs
will stimulate bone formation.
Impact: These studies pioneer a new level of gene regulation for MSC lineage commitment to osteogenesis,
based on an emerging understanding of SED functions in other tissues but have been minimally studied in bone.
By characterizing SED mechanisms related to chromatin organization and stabilization in MSCs, we will discover
novel mechanisms of multi-dimensional coordinate control of transcriptional hubs and protein complexes within
an SED that is responsible for establishing commitment to the osteoblast phenotype. Importantly, knowledge of
the chromatin organization that stabilizes the osteogenic phenotype impacts on future novel treatment strategies
for skeletal disorders."
10754542,"Project Summary – Overall
 Nonhuman primates (NHPs) have historically served as crucial animal models for diseases, and for testing
of new therapies and vaccines that cannot be evaluated in small animal models. The utility of NHP models in
research has been enhanced considerably by the use of immune cell depleting antibodies that can target and
lyse specific cell subsets in vivo. In models of infectious disease and vaccine testing, targeted immune cell
depletion has been used understand the pathogenesis of these infections and to design better vaccines to
prevent them. Furthermore, cell depletion can be an effective immune modulating therapy and the preclinical
testing of these cell-depleting antibody drugs is often conducted in nonhuman primates.
 For the past 18 years, NIH has supported the Nonhuman Primate Reagent Resource’s efforts to develop,
characterize, manufacture and distribute immune cell depleting antibodies for use NHP models through a R24
grant. Need for this program has been confirmed by year-over-year growth in program activity since its inception.
Over the past year, this grant fulfilled over 125 requests for cell-depleting antibody reagents, supporting at least
50 different NIH grants or programs. Nearly 400 grams of cell-depleting antibody for administration to NHP was
distributed.
 This grant proposes to continue this program providing immune cell depleting antibodies for use in NHPs by
maintaining the large-scale manufacture and quality control of the immune cell-depleting and control antibodies.
We will also develop antibodies against new targets and improve existing antibodies by engineering for more
efficient depletion. Our web-based infrastructure will be used for advertising reagents, receiving and fulfilling
requests, and measuring program effectiveness. Efforts to enhance rigor and transparency to improve
reproducibility will be accomplished by facilitating the authentication of key biological resources. Finally, we will
conduct applied research to enhance effector function of cell-depleting antibodies by exploring way to improve
cytotoxicity."

High numbers of women experience sexual violence (SV) in Uganda, and this includes violence from intimate
and non-intimate partners. Studies of past year violence have revealed that three out of four females were
exposed to at least one type of SV: one out of four are victims of sexual coercion, and one out of four have
experienced forced sex. Experiencing SV has harmful effects on physical and mental health including:
unwanted pregnancy, physical injury, risky behaviors, sexual risk-taking behaviors exposing women to
sexually-transmitted infections, chronic stress, depression, low self-esteem and lack of control over
reproductive choices. The negative impacts of SV can be mitigated by health services providing timely and
effective interventions that target injury management and psychological support. However, health services for
victims of SV in Uganda, and much of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), are vastly underutilized to the extent that nine
out of 10 females who experience SV never seek care. Many factors contribute to limited uptake of health
services in Uganda and elsewhere in SSA for SV survivors, including psychological, cultural, economic, and
other factors, such as fear and stigma. Further, health services for victims often lack sufficiently qualified staff
and medical supplies, and confidentiality cannot be ensured. In the absence of timely and effective treatment,
high rates of SV result in serious psychological and physical consequences at a population level and
compromise future social and economic development. Thus, there is a strong need for research that will
generate knowledge that may be used to improve health service utilization for survivors of SV. The proposed
Obuvumu (meaning “courage” in Luganda – a local Ugandan language) study in Uganda innovates and
addresses this need through the following specific aims: Aim 1: Conduct formative qualitative research to
inform a discrete choice experiment (DCE) that will generate systematic information on health service
utilization for female survivors of SV in Uganda; Aim 2: Using a DCE approach, assess the factors that
influence women’s decisions to seek services after experiencing SV among; and Aim 3: Based on findings
from the DCE, apply user-centered design principles to co-design an intervention that addresses barriers and
preferences identified in Aims 1 and 2. If warranted, findings from this R34 will be used to inform an R01
application to test the intervention. Ultimately, study findings may help inform efforts to increase rates of
reporting SV, and improve reproductive health, mental health and related health outcomes for women in
Uganda, and more broadly in low-resource countries in SSA and other regions where rates of SV are high.
Relatedly, the long-term goal of the proposed research is to inform the future development of culturally
appropriate, feasible, acceptable and effective interventions to increase health service utilization among female
survivors of SV."

Antibiotics represent the most successful class of drugs developed by modern science. They have spurred
numerous medical advances by facilitating invasive surgeries with minimal risk of infection. Today, a major
healthcare crisis looms as we are fast approaching a post-antibiotic era. Historically, it has proven to be much
more difficult to find agents that are active against Gram-negative pathogens compared to Gram-positive
pathogens. The primary reason is that Gram-negative bacteria have a unique asymmetric outer membrane (OM)
in addition to an inner membrane. The targets for most antibiotics reside beyond the OM, and thus these
molecules need to penetrate the OM to be active. Yet, the OM is uniquely effective in blocking the translocation
of small molecules, thus creating a major challenge for the field.
The Golden Era of antibiotics leveraged naturally abundant small molecules that were readily identified using
traditional methods; however, this methodology has proven to be much more difficult to be further mined for new
antibiotics during the past several decades. The next phase of antibiotic drug discovery has the potential to be
supported by our increasing collection of proteomics, genomics, and metabolomics data that will reveal promising
drug targets. Academia and industry could potentially exploit these data sets to design small molecule agents
that are potent and of high specificity. To accomplish this, the field fundamentally requires guiding principles
describing the molecular determinants of permeation into bacterial cells akin to the Lipinski’s rules of 5 (Ro5).
We propose to develop a novel fluorescence assay that measures the accumulation of small molecules in Gram-
negative pathogens based on a combination of HaloTag expression and anchoring of a biorthogonal epitope
within HaloTag. Our team will systematically (testing established antibiotics with known permeation profiles) and
broadly (screening a unique library of small molecules modified with an azide tag) apply this approach to
measurably grow our fundamental understanding of the molecular determinants of permeation. Additionally, we
will utilize the same platform to provide unprecedented spatial resolution of the distribution of small molecules
(including known antibiotics) in subcellular compartments."
10993081,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
RNA localization is critical for a diverse set of biological processes. The localization of an RNA depends on
cis-elements, features inherent to the transcript, and trans-factors, effectors independent of the target
transcript, which are often RNA binding proteins. Cis-elements that regulate RNA localization, often called
""zip-codes,"" are often found in the 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of transcripts. However, for the more than
99% of the known localized RNAs, the cis-elements that regulate their localization are unknown. Recent work
from the Taliaferro lab identified several 260 nucleotide RNA sequences within the 3’ UTRs of some
neurite-localized RNAs that were necessary and sufficient for neurite RNA transport. These were identified
using a massively parallel reporter assay that screened approximately 10,000 RNA sequences drawn from
endogenous 3’ UTRs for their ability to traffick a reporter transcript to neurites. Interestingly, 100 nt
subsequences of these 260 nt active elements were not capable of directing RNA transport. This indicates that
(1) the minimal regulatory elements are quite large (likely longer than 100 nt) and (2) the true character of the
localization regulatory elements remains unknown.
In this work, it is proposed to comprehensively characterize the previously identified RNA localization
regulatory elements and zero in on their important features. This will be done by generating a pool of 10,000
RNA sequences based on the previously identified 260 nt zipcodes. Each sequence in this pool will contain
defined deletions of varying sizes that span the length of the zipcode. By integrating these mutants into the 3’
UTR of a reporter transcript assaying which of them retain the ability to direct localization of the reporter to
neurites, a quantitative readout of the functional importance of each nucleotide within the 260 nt zipcode will be
obtained. From this, a clear picture of the important features that make up active localization elements will
arise, facilitating their identification in other localized RNAs.
The large size of these zipcodes suggests that their secondary may be important for their activity. To test this,
their secondary structure will be determined using chemical probing techniques. To test the functionality of the
structure, thousands of mutants that disrupt RNA structure as well as compensatory mutants that restore it will
be generated. As above, the ability of each of these mutants to drive a reporter transcript to neurites will be
tested. In this way, RNA structure and function will be directly related.
Answering these questions will help in understanding the underlying mechanisms of RNA localization as very
few examples of RNA localization have known mechanistic underpinnings. Identifying the mechanism of RNA
localization under physiological conditions is important to being able to understand potential dysfunction in
disease states."

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is steadily increasing, highlighting a critical need to understand the
etiology of this condition. In line with the dramatic rise in T2D, chronic insecticide and herbicide use has also
increased, with RoundUp being the most applied herbicide in the US. As glyphosate, the active ingredient in
RoundUp, targets the shikimate pathway in found in plants, but not mammals, glyphosate is proposed to be safe
for human use. However, our preliminary data show that, even at a dose equivalent to the US Acceptable Daily
Intake, chronic glyphosate exposure impairs oral glucose tolerance in mice. Unlike mammalian cells, several
species of gut bacteria utilize the shikimate pathway, and data from our lab and others indicates that chronic
glyphosate exposure alters the gut microbiome. It is now well-known that the gut microbiome impacts host health,
mediated at least in part by bacterial modification of host endogenous compounds, including bile acids. Primary
bile acids, produced in the liver, are biotransformed into secondary bile acid species by gut bacteria and act as
signaling molecules involved in glucose homeostasis. My preliminary data shows that chronic glyphosate
exposure in mice is associated with a decrease in secondary bile acids, likely occurring due to gut microbiome
shifts. As secondary bile acids primarily agonize the G-protein coupled bile acid receptor 1 (Gpbar1, also known
as TGR5), and TGR5 activation is beneficial for glucose tolerance, it is plausible that glyphosate-mediated shifts
in the gut microbiome impact glucose homeostasis via modification of bile acids and TGR5 signaling. This
hypothesis will be tested in the following Aims: 1) Determine the impact of glyphosate exposure on glucose
tolerance and the gut microbiome and determine if the gut microbiome is necessary for the effects; 2) Determine
how glyphosate alters enterohepatic bile acid homeostasis and if TGR5 mediates the effects of glyphosate on
glucose tolerance. This fellowship will provide training in transgenic mouse colony maintenance, shotgun
metagenomic sequencing and analyses, and bile acid quantification, as well as opportunities for collaboration
with experienced scientists in the field and professional development through conference attendance and
presentations. The lab of Dr. Frank Duca and the University of Arizona provide an excellent environment for this
research, with access to the Microbiome Core at the Steele Children’s Research Center, the University of Arizona
Gnotobiotic Facility, as well as knowledge from researchers in the fields of pharmacology and toxicology and
metabolism."
10899503,"The Role of BHLHB2 in Scleroderma-Associated Lung Fibrosis
Scleroderma/Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) is a fibrosing multi-system rheumatic disease associated with excessive
deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) components such as collagen and fibronectin. The predominant and
fatal complication of SSc is Pulmonary Fibrosis (PF), for which current treatments are marginally effective. IL-6
is a pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokine produced in excess in SSc fibroblasts. Likewise, insulin-like growth
factor (IGF)-II, a member of the IGF family, is produced in excess in SSc fibroblasts and is implicated in the
development of pulmonary fibrosis. Our lab has shown that IGF-II levels are increased in both SSc lung tissues
and the primary fibroblasts derived from them, and that IGF-II induces a fibrotic response in normal lung (NL)
fibroblasts. IGF-II increases levels of collagen, fibronectin, and the pro-fibrotic transforming growth factor beta-2
(TGF2). In this application, we demonstrate that IL-6 increases IGF-II mRNA levels. Microarray analysis of
IGF-II-treated NL fibroblasts revealed increased expression of the Basic Helix-Loop-Helix transcription factor
family member, BHLHB2, a known regulator of the circadian rhythm, adipogenesis, and fibroblast autophagy.
Our preliminary data further show that both IL-6 and IGF-II increase nuclear BHLHB2 levels in NL fibroblasts.
We show that BHLHB2 activation is a common link between, and downstream mediator for several profibrotic
agents: TGF, IL-6 and IGF-II. Silencing BHLHB2 downregulated IGF-II. IGF-II induced BHLHB2 via signaling
through the Insulin Receptor. Thus, our central hypothesis is that BHLHB2 contributes to the progression of
Scleroderma-associated Lung Fibrosis by increasing levels of ECM genes. Our goal is to delineate the role of
BHLHB2 in the development of lung fibrosis in Systemic Sclerosis by (1) identifying the mechanism by which IL-
6 and IGF-II regulate BHLHB2, comparing differentially-expressed genes in single cell RNASeq of IGF-II-and IL-
6 stimulated normal lung and (2) elucidating the role of BHLHB2 in lung fibrosis. These aims are consistent with
the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute’s mission since they will provide important fundamental basis for
addressing translational aspects of the interaction between genetic dysregulation due to IGF-II and development
of SSc-associated PF. We envision that our work will provide a rationale for a therapy to block IL-6 and IGF-II
function concomitantly to halt the progression of lung fibrosis in SSc. Since SSc-PF is characterized by activation
of common fibrotic pathways and increases in ECM components (collagen, fibronectin), which are also increased
in different diseases characterized by lung fibrosis, our findings may have wider implications for lung fibrosis
associated with other diseases. In addition to facilitating a deeper understanding of mechanisms of SSc-PF, this
proposal provides Adegboyega Timothy Adewale with a rigorous training under the mentorship of Dr. Carol
Feghali-Bostwick and equips him with cutting-edge techniques to develop as an astute and skillful physician-
scientist."
10752670,"Project Summary/Abstract
Treatment of early stage breast cancer has substantially improved but preventing metastasis remains a more
elusive target. Obesity, which is endemic in our society, is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer
and accelerated metastasis. The means by which obesity compromises survival of breast cancer patients is,
however, poorly understood. Liver is among the most common sites of breast cancer metastasis and its
occurrence is generally associated with poor prognosis. Liver health is closely related to weight as obesity is the
major cause of fatty liver disease, estimated to be present in 1/4 to 1/3 of Americans.
We discovered that fatty liver disease markedly increases liver metastasis, in mice, by providing fuel to tumor
cells thereby accelerating their growth. Examination of human liver biopsies and MRI analysis suggests the same
is true in women with metastatic breast cancer. Thus, our first goal is to determine if treating fatty liver disease
reduces breast cancer liver metastasis and improves its response to chemotherapy. To identify potential new
treatments for liver metastasis we will explore the mechanisms by which fatty liver disease stimulates tumor
growth. Finally, we will ask if human breast cancers exhibit the same liver metastatic properties as those arising
in mice. If our conclusion proves true, treatment of breast cancer will universally require prevention and treatment
of fatty liver disease and therefore impact all affected women. Prevention and treatment of fatty liver disease in
breast cancer patients, however, may likely reduce liver metastasis and therefore prolong survival. Because fatty
liver disease is most often the product of obesity, educating patients about calorie intake, which can be instituted
immediately, may have significant effects on breast cancer prognosis."

Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is a highly prevalent chronic condition and is associated with poorer
psychosocial well-being, communication, and cognitive function. Evidence that hearing aid (HA) use mitigates
negative consequences of ARHL is inconclusive because, in part, longitudinal population-based studies of
hearing with sufficient follow-up times are rare and few have considered the extent to which earlier intervention
with HA improves long-term HA outcomes and reduces the wide-ranging consequences of ARHL. The long-
term objective is to reduce impacts of ARHL by maximizing overall HA benefit. The specific objective is to
holistically assess benefits of HA use on psychosocial well-being, communication, and cognitive outcomes that
capture general and hearing-specific health and determine the extent to which earlier intervention for ARHL is
a determinant of HA benefit. To achieve this objective, two specific aims are proposed. Aim 1 will use
longitudinal data from the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) Longitudinal Cohort Study of ARHL to
determine benefits of HA use and assess contributions of early intervention and test hypotheses that a) use of
HA will be associated with better general health aspects of psychosocial well-being, cognition, and
communication, and b) earlier intervention with HA will be associated with greater HA benefit as determined by
these outcomes. Aim 2 will use cross-temporal data to determine benefits of HA use and assess contributions
of early intervention using historic and newly collected data from participants in the MUSC Longitudinal Cohort
Study of ARHL to test hypotheses that a) use of HA will be associated with better hearing-specific psychosocial
well-being and communication outcomes, and b) earlier intervention with HA will be associated with greater HA
benefit as determined by these outcomes. Results from this project will positively impact public health research
and clinical practice. Specifically, results can inform future epidemiological research and/or clinical trials aiming
to determine effects of early intervention on HA benefit, optimal timing of HA interventions, and the appropriate
age to begin screening for ARHL. This project and line of research directly addresses the National Academies
of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2016) recommendation to improve prospective population-based
evidence on impacts of ARHL and its treatment and aligns with NIDCD’s strategic plan on secondary and
tertiary prevention and health promotion for individuals with ARHL. That is, this proposal aims to determine
importance of early intervention for ARHL (secondary prevention) and benefits of HA use (tertiary prevention)
on general and hearing-related measures of psychosocial well-being, communication, and cognition. This
project and training plan will provide rigorous mentored training in new methods focused on epidemiological
and public health research in audiology, grantsmanship, teaching, and career/professional development, and
will support the applicant’s long-term goals of being an independent, NIH-funded clinician-researcher."
10973550,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Placental development is critical in the early stages of pregnancy, as dysregulation of this process can lead to
intrauterine growth restriction of the fetus, preeclampsia, and miscarriage. A fundamental step in placental
development is the invasion of extravillous trophoblast cells into the endometrium of the uterus. A key mediator
of the invasive trophoblast phenotype is cytoskeletal remodeling driven by the activity of the small GTPase Rho.
Dynamic changes in the cytoskeleton are indispensable for initiating cell polarity and forming cell protrusions
and adhesions that drive cell migration, and the tightly coordinated regulation of these changes is critical for
successful placental development. However, the specific signaling mechanisms that regulate Rho GTPase
cytoskeletal remodeling during trophoblast invasion remain unclear. Previously published data have
suggested that the c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) subfamily of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) may
be involved in trophoblast invasion, however the mechanism by which it accomplishes this is not well understood.
Recent screens from our lab have identified the Rho GTPase activating proteins (Rho GAPs) SYDE1 and SYDE2
as novel JNK substrates based on kinase-substrate docking interactions. Existing literature indicate roles of
SYDE1 and SYDE2 in migration in trophoblasts and cytoskeletal remodeling. It is therefore likely that SYDE1
and/or SYDE2 may be involved in a JNK signaling axis that regulates Rho GTPase cytoskeletal rearrangement
and migration during trophoblast invasion. The objective of this proposal is to elucidate how JNK modulates
SYDE1 and SYDE2 to control migration and invasion of trophoblasts. This proposal will determine the
functional consequences of JNK-mediated regulation of SYDE1 and SYDE2 in trophoblasts by examining the
effects on cell morphology, cytoskeletal organization, and migration in human trophoblast cells harboring SYDE1
or SYDE2 deletion or overexpression. Placental tissue samples will also be analyzed to examine clinical
relevance of JNK signaling through these proteins. GTPase biosensor assays will be used to determine whether
JNK phosphorylation of SYDE1 and SYDE2 positively regulates their activity as Rho GAPs. In vitro GTPase
assays will determine whether this mechanism is accomplished by affecting GAP enzymatic activity. In order to
establish whether any observed effects are dependent on JNK phosphorylation, JNK inhibitors and docking-site
mutant SYDE1 and SYDE2 will be used to ablate JNK-specific phosphorylation. Ultimately, identifying JNK and
small GTPase regulators as a key molecular players in trophoblast signaling, as well as understanding the
mechanisms by which they act, will allow them to be explored as molecular targets to treat severe pregnancy
complications related to aberrant trophoblast migration."

 Pneumonia induces heterogeneous responses in the lung, resulting in pathobiological sub-
phenotypes. Because these sub-phenotypes are difficult to identify in patients and are responsive to
different treatments, elucidating and characterizing lung pathology sub-phenotypes is a major research
priority. Mouse models used to study pneumonia may capture some, but not all, human pneumonia
sub-phenotype features, but this has yet to be formally examined. To characterize the lung biology
underlying human pneumonia sub-phenotypes, we analyzed autopsy tissue samples from hundreds of
elderly subjects who died with pneumonia using histopathology and immunohistochemistry. We
observed broad heterogeneous lung pathobiologies and diverse immune landscapes across these
human lung samples, including differences in lymphocyte and neutrophil infiltration. Increased fibrin in
the lung parenchyma positively correlated with neutrophil infiltration, suggesting a link between fibrin
accumulation and neutrophil recruitment or activity. To determine which aspects of human pneumonia
sub-phenotypes are recapitulated or missed in commonly used mouse models of pneumonia, we
characterized pulmonary histopathology in mice with severe and diverse pneumonias caused by
Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp) or influenza A virus (IAV) infection. IAV infection was characterized by
pulmonary lymphoplasmacytosis, whereas Sp3-infected lungs were instead inundated with neutrophils
and high intra-alveolar fibrin deposition reflecting the fibrin-neutrophil association observed in human
autopsy samples. To investigate the mechanisms promoting pneumonia sub-phenotype diversity in the
lung, we propose in this F32 the following aims to test the hypotheses that 1) age, previous infection
experience, and additional pathogens will reveal additional and diverse pneumonia sub-phenotypes
reflected in our human pneumonia samples, and 2) severing the interactions between polymerized fibrin
and neutrophils in the airspace will decrease the pathogenesis of pneumonia mediated by Sp but not
IAV. Advancing pneumonia models to better reflect human lung biology will help define mechanisms
for the establishment of specific pneumonia sub-phenotypes and will be essential for targeted design
and proper utilization of host-directed pneumonia therapeutics."

The prominent change in the myeloid compartment in cancer is the expansion of pathologically activated
immature myeloid cells with the potent ability to suppress immune responses – myeloid-derived suppressor cells
(MDSC). In tumor-bearing mice, the total population of MDSC consists of three groups of cells: the most
abundant (>75%) immature, pathologically activated neutrophils (PMN-MDSC); less abundant (<20%)
population of pathologically activated monocytes (M-MDSC); and small (<5%) population of early myeloid
precursors. In the tumor microenvironment MDSC are more immunosuppressive than in peripheral lymphoid
organ. However, the mechanism of this phenomenon remains rather elusive. The gaps in our knowledge is in
understanding the mechanisms regulating the function of MDSC in tumors and specific requirements for their
targeting. In this proposal we will test the hypothesis that there are distinct populations of MDSC in tumors. These
populations can be defined by specific markers and most importantly, have different sensitivity to ferroptotic cell
death which determines their functional activity. We will test the concept that targeting ferroptosis in PMN-MDSC
in cancer may have functional consequences for immune responses. The goal of this project is to uncover the
mechanisms regulating myeloid cell function in tumors and to develop novel approaches to the regulation of
immune responses in cancer.
We propose the following Specific Aims: (1) To identify the mechanism of ferroptosis-mediated immune
suppression induced by PMN-MDSC in tumors; and (2) To investigate therapeutic potential of targeting
ferroptosis in PMN-MDSC."

From movement to memory, the complex and wide-ranging tasks performed by the nervous system depend on
the polarization of billions of neurons into two functionally distinct subcellular compartments: dendrites, which
receive most of the input into the neuron, and the axon, which transmits information to other cells in the form of
an action potential. Two powerful contributors to neuronal polarity are 1) the axon initial segment (AIS), a domain
at the beginning of the axon that initiates action potentials, and 2) microtubules (MTs), cytoskeletal filaments
involved in axon outgrowth and cargo trafficking1,2. Disrupting either of these impairs the other and causes broad
downstream defects in neuronal polarity and function3–6, suggesting that the interplay between these structures
is a key regulator of neuronal polarity. Intriguingly, MTs within the AIS form bundles, called “fascicles”, that are
rarely observed outside the AIS7,8. This unique organization supports the idea that the AIS and MTs work together
to control neuronal polarity. Therefore, investigating MT fasciculation could unlock new insights into how neurons
establish and maintain polarity, as well as how that process might go awry in neurodevelopmental and
neurodegenerative disorders. Though AIS MT fasciculation was first observed over 50 years ago7,8, little
progress has been made in determining its function, largely because a lack of candidates for the driver of MT
fasciculation made loss-of-function studies impossible. However, a recent breakthrough occurred with the
discovery of the protein Tripartite Motif Containing 46 (TRIM46) at the AIS9. TRIM46 localizes to AIS MTs, and
TRIM46-deficient cultured neurons lack AIS MT fasciculation9,10. They also exhibit impaired AIS formation and a
range of defects in axonal outgrowth, protein distribution, and MT orientation, suggesting that TRIM46 is required
for both AIS MT fasciculation and neuronal polarity more broadly9. However, these exciting claims are based on
TRIM46 knockdown by shRNA, mostly in cultured neurons, so the observed defects could be attributed to shRNA
toxicity or the artificial culture environment. No work has been done to investigate TRIM46 knockout in vivo. This
project will leverage the Rasband lab’s extensive experience with the in vivo study of the AIS to fill this gap. The
objective of this proposal is to use TRIM46 knockout mice to determine the role of TRIM46 in the nervous system
and test the specific hypothesis that TRIM46 is required for AIS MT fasciculation and neuronal polarity in vivo.
The proposed experiments will use immunostaining and high-resolution microscopy methods to determine the
consequences of TRIM46 knockout from neuronal ultrastructure to behavior and in the contexts of development
and injury. Aim 1 will determine the role of TRIM46 in AIS formation, ultrastructure, and MT fasciculation. Aim 2
will determine the role of TRIM46 in neuronal morphological, molecular, and MT polarity. Aim 3 will determine
the consequences of TRIM46 knockout on neuronal migration, axon regeneration, and behavior. Completion of
this project will reveal the function of TRIM46 at the convergence of the AIS and MTs from which neuronal
polarity emerges."

The central theme running through the center’s research projects and training program is
consistent and robust communication across community partners and to and with mothers.
Each community partner represents a node or access point to a larger web of community
networks. These networks are necessary to garner community buy-in and engagement that
amplifies community voices, needs, and resources. As liaisons, our community partners will
ensure community member access to each stage of the center’s research projects and training
program, including conceptualization, planning, execution, assessment, and dissemination.
The first research project will develop and adapt an evidence-based community worker home
visiting program that is grounded in extensive patient and community participation as well as
partnerships with community organizations in healthcare, mental health, social work, and
child/lactation support. The second research project will evaluate the effectiveness of a
multilevel and multisectoral communication and health literacy strategy to increase trust and
engagement in postpartum healthcare, through partnerships with community organizations in
healthcare, racial and economic justice, and health policy. Supporting the goals of the research
projects, an extensive research training program for early-stage investigators will address the
interpersonal and structural factors that affect maternal outcomes, leveraging community
partnerships with a consortium of academic and non-profit institutions supporting positive
change in the Mississippi Delta.
Aim 1: Establish a meaningful and equal community partnership throughout the entire
research development and implementation process.
Aim 2: Ensure transparency and trust by employing community-centric strategies for
dissemination.
Aim 3: Adjust and adapt the center through a community-based model to make a lasting

Increasing antibiotic resistance necessitates expanding research into the mechanisms by which bacterial
pathogens acquire and perpetuate drug resistance. Despite rapidly expanding genomic mapping of
resistance-conferring mutations in clinical isolates and laboratory studies, our knowledge of dynamics and
mechanisms underlying evolution of antimicrobial resistance is still insufficient. To fill-in this gap, the authors
of this proposal combine experimental evolution in a continuous culturing device, morbidostat, with time-
resolved ultradeep genomic sequencing of evolving bacterial cultures. The utility of the developed
morbidostat-based workflow is supported by published and ongoing studies with established antimicrobials
and experimental drug candidates. The preliminary results of comparative resistomics studies over a range
of Gram-negative bacterial species provided initial support to a premise that evolution of drug resistance in
morbidostat proceeds via a limited set of trajectories defined by a combination of resistance and fitness
constrains approximating clinical evolution, which favors selection of low-frequency/high-fitness over high-
frequency/low-fitness mutants. A comparative resistomics approach enables mapping of both universal and
strain-specific mechanisms as demonstrated in a recent proof-of-concept study on experimental evolution of
ciprofloxacin resistance in three Gram-negative bacteria. The proposed 5-year project will test the central
hypothesis and extend exploration of antimicrobial resistome by pursuing the following specific aims: (i) in
Aim 1, the established morbidostat-based workflow will be used to determine major mechanisms driving
resistance to broad-spectrum clinical antibiotics, ciprofloxacin, colistin, tigecycline and meropenem, in four
difficult-to-treat Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC17978, P. aeruginosa
ATCC27853, E. coli ATCC25922, and K. pneumoniae ATCC13883; (ii) in Aim 2, a representative panel of
selected clones will be systematically characterized to assess the effects of individual mutations and
combinations thereof on acquired resistance and fitness; (iii) Aim 3 will leverage a moribidostat-based
workflow to make first steps toward experimental evolution of multidrug resistance focusing on A. baumannii
and starting from clones selected in single-drug evolution studies. The results that will be obtained in all
planned studies will be a subject of in-depth bioinformatics analysis (including comparison with public data
for clinical isolates), predictive modeling, integration and sharing with broad research community via a
specialized web-site on integrative Genomics of Evolution of Antimicrobial Resistance (iGEAR). The proposed
study is expected to have translational impacts in advancing methodology to support rational optimization of
antibiotic treatment regimens and development of new drugs with minimized resistibility."

10744771,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including preeclampsia, are among the leading causes of maternal
deaths. It has been suggested that in preeclampsia, placental hypoperfusion/ischemia results in release of pro-
inflammatory factors that interact with the maternal vascular wall to induce maternal vascular dysfunction and
hypertension. The molecular pathways linking placenta-derived factors and maternal vascular dysfunction are
not understood. Furthermore, the mechanisms determining the release of placenta-derived factors in the
maternal circulation are underexplored. The proposed studies will address these knowledge gaps by testing
the role of extracellular mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) as a novel link between maternal vascular dysfunction and
placental ischemia, common features of preeclampsia. Plasma from women with preeclampsia has increased
circulating cell-free mtDNA, which has been shown to be immunogenic and pro-inflammatory in various
inflammatory conditions. Furthermore, clinical studies have demonstrated a positive association between
circulating mtDNA and the risk of developing preeclampsia. Here, we propose that circulating cell-free mtDNA
derived from the placenta is a major contributor to maternal vascular dysfunction in preeclampsia, due in part
to its effects on Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR-9). Aim 1: we will determine a molecular mechanism linking
extracellular mtDNA with maternal vascular dysfunction during pregnancy. We hypothesize that vascular
exposure to extracellular mtDNA will induce an increase in maternal vascular tone through activation of TLR-9
signaling. This hypothesis will be tested using an integrative approach involving isolated maternal arteries,
vascular cells, and an in vivo mtDNA challenge in healthy non-pregnant and pregnant rats. Aim 2: we will
determine a potential mechanism by which placental hypoxia induces release of mtDNA. We will test the
hypothesis that placental hypoxia causes increased generation of reactive oxygen species, which in turn
triggers the release of mtDNA into the extracellular space by inducing cell death and increasing autophagy. To
address this hypothesis, we will use human trophoblast cells and rat placental explants. Aim 3: we will
determine whether increased circulating mtDNA is involved in the pathogenesis or maintenance of the
maternal cardiovascular syndrome in preeclampsia. We will test the hypothesis that increased circulating
mtDNA triggers the maternal cardiovascular syndrome in an animal model with placental ischemia that mimics
clinical end-points of preeclampsia and has higher concentrations of circulating mtDNA compared to normal
pregnant rats. This research may have a translational impact because it will provide a pre-clinical platform for
the development of pharmacological strategies to reduce mtDNA release, neutralize extracellular mtDNA, or
inhibit TLR-9 in those women who have high concentrations of circulating cell-free mtDNA during pregnancy."
10744795,"The BRAINS (Broadening the Representation of Academic Investigators in NeuroScience) Program,
established in 2011, explicitly addresses the inclusion, retention, and advancement of early career (post Ph.D.
to pre-tenure) neuroscientists from historically underrepresented and marginalized groups (URMGs: individuals
from marginalized racial and ethnic identities and persons with disabilities). BRAINS has pioneered a unique
cohort-based professional development approach that positively impacts participants’ career trajectories,
especially in academic neuroscience, by building a community of neuroscience peers1,2, enabling mentoring
networks3,4, activating participants’ cultural capital1, and increasing participants’ career self-efficacy5. The
success of BRAINS is evident by our findings that 90% of the 144 participants continue to remain in
neuroscience careers. Moreover, 50% are currently in tenure track positions, compared to 24% at time of
joining BRAINS. With this renewal application, Aim 1 seeks to build on the successes of BRAINS by
expanding our program through an increase in the number of the BRAINS community participants, as well as
deepening the engagement of all participants with core BRAINS skills and concepts. When compared to other
national professional development programs, the BRAINS program stands out in terms of the extent to which
BRAINS participants continue to engage deeply with the community long after their first year in the program. In
its first decade, evaluation data show that BRAINS programming is a consistent transformational and
foundational resource for its participants. Thus, the BRAINS program is uniquely positioned to explore and
identify the essential factors that increase retention of neuroscientists from URMGs in academic and
nonacademic science careers. Therefore, in Aim 2, we will introduce a new 10-year evaluation instrument to
help us to better understand why the program is impactful and what sticks with participants as they progress
through their careers. In summary, these Aims will allow BRAINS to expand in terms of participant numbers
and in terms of continuing to empower over 200 neuroscientists from URMGs to thrive and advance in their
careers. Further, this work will shed new light on the important factors that can improve the long term retention
of neuroscientists from URMGs in science careers, which in turn can inform the development of future
programs and institutional policies aimed at increasing the retention of URM scientists in biomedical careers."

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Despite the
introduction of novel therapies, the five-year survival rate for metastatic disease remains around 10%. To
improve our understanding of tumor progression and drug efficacy, it is vital to develop preclinical tumor models
that accurately reflect the native pathophysiology of CRC “ex vivo”. The complexities of the tumor
microenvironment (TME), including stromal cell types and mechanical forces, are not fully reproduced in existing
preclinical models. Microfluidic-based “organ-on-chip” technologies, which are designed to simulate the 3-D
human organ environment both mechanically (e.g., fluid flow and cyclic deformation) and biochemically (e.g.,
nutrient digestion, secretion, transport), have recently provided researchers with greater insights into and
expanded control over the TME. In this proposal, we are adapting the organ-on-chip technology to create human
colon organ chips colonized with patient-derived CRC cells and stromal elements (endothelial and cancer-
associated fibroblast (CAF) cells) in relevant tissue:tissue compartments with integrated microfluidics and
stretching to mimic in vivo peristalsis-like motions. The goal is to create a physiologically relevant, organ-
dependent tumor model that will allow for long-term culture and characterization of CRC cellular dynamics, and
serve as a platform for testing specific therapeutic modalities to prevent or delay tumor progression.
Using novel imaging assays and “omics” based approaches, we will evaluate the role of the physical (i.e.,
peristalsis) and cellular (CAFs) microenvironment in colon tumor progression. In Aim 1, we will develop patient-
derived CRC-on-Chips incorporating primary normal and tumor epithelium to assess CRC tumor growth and
early metastatic spread (i.e., invasion into the vascular channel) in the presence of cyclic stretch, mimicking
peristalsis. In Aim 2, we will analyze the impact of the stromal CAF microenvironment on tumor cell behavior and
examine the extent and role of inter-patient CAF functional heterogeneity. In Aim 3, we will assess the drug
screening capabilities of the CRC-on-Chip platform via monitoring of drug-induced cellular responses, and
determine whether drug responses on chips can predict patient clinical responses. The longer-term vision for
developing a microengineered CRC model that more closely resembles human disease is to expedite the
identification and screening of novel drug targets and innovative treatment strategies with a focus on disrupting
tumor-stromal interactions. Our multi-disciplinary team with complementary expertise, the groundbreaking
technologies, and availability of clinical materials put us in a prime position to successfully address important
aspects of CRC tumorigenesis and advance our understanding of the tumor niche."
10754259,"Project Summary
Social memory is critical for daily functioning but becomes impaired in many neuropsychiatric disorders,
including Alzheimer disease and post-traumatic stress disorder. The dearth of effective therapeutics for social
memory deficits demands rigorous study of the neural circuit mechanisms governing social memory dynamics.
Recent work in mice has shown that neuronal ensembles in ventral hippocampal area CA1 (vCA1) and medial
prefrontal cortex (mPFC) encode various aspects of social interaction, including the identity of a social
conspecific. Moreover, intact communication in projections from vCA1 to mPFC is critical for short-term social
recognition memory, and mouse models of neuropsychiatric disorders with impaired social memory display
corresponding network deficits in this pathway. These findings are well-aligned with a canonical model of long-
term memory in which the hippocampus transfers a critical component of a memory’s representation to frontal
cortical areas for long-term consolidation. However, mechanisms underlying long-term consolidation of social
memories, such as whether social memories abide by this hippocampocortical transfer model, remain largely
uninvestigated. A major reason for this deficit is the highly fleeting nature of social memories in common
laboratory rodents preventing meaningful efforts to study long-term recall.
 Thus, the goal of this proposal is to test whether hippocampocortical memory transfer underlies lasting
social memory consolidation using a novel model of long-term social memory in pair bonded prairie voles.
Prairie voles, like humans, form monogamous, mating-based pair bonds. These bonds require stable,
emotionally salient memory of the partner for long-term maintenance; this project will thus leverage pair
bonding as a proxy for lasting and emotionally salient social memory. Aim 1 will determine the necessity of
intact neuronal signaling in vCA1, mPFC, and vCA1-to-mPFC projections in prairie vole pair bond memory
acquisition and long-term recall through reversible chemogenetic inhibition of each circuit component. Aim 2
will examine neuronal dynamics in vCA1 and its projections to mPFC involved in the formation and long-term
recall of the memory of a pair bonded partner through in vivo calcium imaging.
 In sum, this proposal will expand our fundamental understanding of how emotionally salient social
memories are formed and stored for distant recall in the brain. This work will also provide the applicant with
invaluable training for his future career as a neuropsychiatrist focused on translating foundational knowledge
from systems neuroscience into novel, highly precise therapies for cognitive dysfunction."
10892078,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Women experience worse symptoms and outcomes following traumatic brain injury (TBI), contrary to the
consensus in preclinical research that female sex hormones confer neuroprotection. Multiple mechanisms
have been proposed to drive this health disparity, including hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle
and into the menopausal transition, a predisposition to seek medical attention or report symptoms, and
increased neurobiological vulnerability to injury. In particular, increased vulnerability to mechanical trauma in
female axons and the role of neurosteroid hormones have not been thoroughly examined in human TBI.
While mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI) make up the majority of TBIs, research often focuses on a specific
sub-type of mTBI: sports-related concussions. However, many people experience head trauma during a
traumatic event, such as motor vehicle collisions, physical assault, sexual assault, or falls, and the lifetime
prevalence of experiencing at least traumatic event is extremely high (90%). As the literature on sports-related
concussions may not always generalize to this trauma-exposed population, we aim to characterize sex
differences in structural and functional connectivity (Aim 1), examine sex-dependent associations between TBI
pathophysiology and outcomes (Aim 2), and finally assess the influence of concurrent estradiol levels on TBI
outcomes and neuroimaging markers (Aim 3) To address these aims, I will leverage a large, existing dataset
from the AURORA study, a multisite, longitudinal study of posttraumatic outcomes. Participants were recruited
to AURORA if they presented to a participating Emergency Department (ED) within 72 hours of a qualifying
traumatic event and then were followed through 12-months posttrauma. Participants were assessed using a
multidimensional range of tools and measures to general a one-of-a-kind, rich dataset to study the complex,
co-occurring symptoms and overlapping neural correlates of adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae
across a variety of disciplines. About one-third of AURORA participants met modified American Congress of
Rehabilitation Medicine criteria for TBI. However, as the acute and chronic stress responses can mask and
compound signs and symptoms of TBI, it is essential to use an objective marker to establish TBI in this trauma-
exposed cohort. We propose to use ED GFAP levels to identify individuals with TBI, which have shown to be
significantly elevated in individuals with TBI for several days following presentation at the ED. TBI outcomes
will include not only somatic symptoms (e.g., headache, sensitivity to light) but also PTSD and depression
symptoms and mental health-related quality of life. Completion of this project will not only inform our
understanding of neurobiological factors that affect sex differences in TBI outcomes but also provide excellent
postdoctoral training for the applicant in diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, resting-state functional
connectivity, neuroendocrinology, PTSD and stress-related psychopathology, and biostatistics and data
science for human neuroscience research, preparing her for a successful career as an independent scholar."

Stress and chronic pain disorders are comorbid conditions wherein stress exacerbates pain. Mindfulness
meditation, a non-opioidergic and self-regulatory technique that trains non-reactive awareness to arising
sensory and affective events, reduces clinical and experimentally induced pain and stress. Our recently
completed psychophysical and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study found that four, 20-minute
sessions of mindfulness training in healthy participants reduced stress ( 39%, p = .023) and pain intensity (
32%, p < .001) in response to noxious heat (49°C). Stress reductions also predicted lower pain intensity (p
= .013). The perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC), a cognitive-affective brain area involved in
reappraisal, and the amygdala, a key brain area involved in sensory and emotional processing, are associated
with modulating pain and stress and share extensive anatomical connections. Our laboratory has
demonstrated that increased pgACC activity underlies mindfulness-induced reductions in pain and anxiety in
healthy individuals, while mindfulness-induced deactivation of the amygdala has been shown to correlate with
pain and stress relief across separate studies. Despite these findings, no study has determined whether
mindfulness meditation promotes stress relief and analgesia by modulating the pgACC and corresponding
neural activity in and connectivity between nociceptive and negative affect-specific brain regions. To this end,
we will analyze the blood-oxygen-level-dependent fMRI data corresponding to our behavioral findings to test
the following hypotheses. We will first determine if higher pgACC (HYP1a) and lower amygdala (HYP1b)
activity during mindfulness is associated with higher pain/stress relief. We will next determine if increased
pgACC-amygdalar functional connectivity correlates with mindfulness-induced pain (HYP1c) and stress relief
(HYP1d). Our preliminary analyses found that mindfulness-induced analgesia correlates with reductions in
machine-learned, multivariate fMRI signatures sensitive and specific to nociception (neurologic pain signature;
NPS, p = .03) and stimulus-induced negative affect (p = .01). We will similarly determine if reductions in
negative affect brain responses correspond to stress relief (HYP2a). Finally, we will confirm if increased NPS-
(HYP2b) and negative affect signature- (HYP2c) pgACC connectivity is associated with pain and/or stress
relief. The proposed research and training will be accomplished under the mentorship of my Sponsor, Co-
sponsors, and Co-Mentor, who are experts in fMRI clinical trials on pain, meditation, and/or stress. Activities
include a) training in pain-evoking procedures and statistical and computational techniques, programming, and
neuroanatomy for analysis of behavioral and fMRI data b) ethical interactions with individuals with chronic pain
and stress, c) scientifically validated mindfulness training, and d) fostering career development strategies. The
knowledge and skills gained will prepare me to successfully navigate a career as an independent cognitive
neuroscientist identifying the brain mechanisms of novel treatments for pain and comorbid health ailments."

 In this proposal, we aim to characterize the multi-enzymatic and chondroprotective functions of a
bioactive biomaterial, manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanoparticles (NPs), as a therapeutic strategy to
mitigate oxidative stress in osteoarthritis (OA). The motivation for this work is the critical need to address
limitations for treating OA as a looming public health crisis, projected to affect 130 million people worldwide by
2050 due to an aging population.
 Oxidative stress, the imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and antioxidant
function, is known to contribute to OA progression and may represent an important therapeutic target. There
have been numerous studies to evaluate the use of antioxidants and small molecules as therapeutic agents,
however these therapies are limited by poor bioavailability and stability within the joint. The objective of this
proposal is to utilize a metal-oxide biomaterial (MnO2) to overcome limitations of retention and bioavailability
and seeks to explore enzyme-mimicking functions to reduce the effects of oxidative stress. We have previously
shown that MnO2 can be engineered with cartilage-targeting properties, such as size and charge, that can
overcome limitations of traditional antioxidant therapies. Leveraging these properties we have seen improved
retention of MnO2 NPs in healthy and OA joints. Due to the barriers for targeting cartilage, this advancement is
critical in the development of a chondroprotective therapy. We hypothesize that MnO2 NPs possess enzyme
mimicking properties that will reduce oxidative stress in the joint thereby alleviating pain and disease
pathogenesis.
 Characterization of enzyme mimicking functions is critical in the use of MnO2 NPs for biomedical
applications and may further classify the biomaterial as a ‘nanozyme.’ Our lab has already characterized the
hydrogen peroxide scavenging properties of MnO2 NPs and we anticipate ‘nanozyme’ classification will outline
catalase-like, superoxide-like, and peroxidase-like functions of MnO2. In Aim 1, we will examine how MnO2 NPs
influence compartment specific H2O2 production and the downstream effects of oxidative stress. Specifically,
we will characterize the antioxidant-like properties of MnO2 NPs and their impact on redox signaling,
chondroprotection, and inflammatory effects. In Aim 2 we will evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of MnO2 NPs in
vivo using a rodent model of post traumatic OA (PTOA) through comprehensive evaluation of NP retention in
the joint, joint remodeling, and behavior. Immediate treatment following joint trauma, which leads to PTOA, is a
critical opportunity for translation of a cartilage targeting therapy by leveraging cartilage that is still intact and
may be responsive to mitigating oxidative stress. The proposed work is significant and innovative by revealing
key mechanisms for mitigating oxidative stress and advancing the use of an enzyme-mimicking therapy that
may facilitate translation of strategies to slow the progression of joint disease."

Understanding how the nervous system transforms sensory inputs into motor commands is a

this behavior. Here, we look to characterize the sensorimotor transformation occurring within
two olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) classes in Drosophila melanogaster and identify how they

connection patterns between the first-order neurons of the olfactory system and the downstream
second- and third-order neurons. The fly is highly tractable and we will use genetic strategies to
optogenetically activate this first-order ORN classes and record from the second- and third-
order neurons in response to this activation. By observing fly behavior in response to this ORN
activation we can determine the relationship between its selective activation and its impact on
behavior, as well as how the transformation between the first- to second- and second- to third-
order neurons impact this expressed behavior. By combining optogenetics, electrophysiology,

Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) afflict upwards
of 250,000 Americans every year. NRDS affects premature infants due to their underdeveloped lung’s inability
to produce sufficient functional lung surfactant. Animal replacement surfactant treatment options exist for NRDS,
although concerns over bio-variability, interspecies disease transmittance, and religious questions over porcine
versus bovine derived surfactants remain. ARDS was seen in ~75% of all admitted COVID-19 ICU patients and
is currently untreatable leading to a mortality rate of ~40%. ARDS is initiated by lung trauma or disease that
leads to inflammation, causing an uncharacteristic increase of the surface tension within the lungs, leading to
atelectasis. A deeper understanding of the fundamental structure and limiting behavior of lung surfactant
monolayers may be the avenue to suggest new synthetic replacement surfactant treatments that could mitigate
the biological concerns in NRDS as well as develop treatment options for patients with ARDS. My group has
previously identified that the “collapse” of a monolayer determines the lower surface tension limit during the
alveolar area compression accompanying exhalation. The physical and chemical factors that govern collapse
may be altered in patients who develop dysfunctional, high surface tension lung surfactant during ARDS.
Monolayers of healthy lung surfactant phase separate into domains of a semi-crystalline ordered phase and a
disordered liquid phase of varied composition. We hypothesize that this phase separation dictates many of
the dynamic and rheological properties of the monolayer that influence collapse. However, there is little
direct information on the composition of the different domains in multicomponent lung surfactants. I will address
monolayer collapse and phase separation in the following two aims. In Aim 1, I will visualize monolayer collapse
structures using the 3-D serial sectioning capabilities of the confocal fluorescence microscope to determine how
monolayer domains alter collapse behavior and the minimum surface tension. I have also recently found that
collapse behavior changes on curved, alveolar-size interfaces compared to the flat surfaces in a Langmuir
trough, and I will use confocal imaging to determine the relationship between collapse morphology and interfacial
curvature. Aim 2 is to pioneer infrared-coupled atomic force microscopy (AFM-IR) methods to map the lateral
distribution of the chemical species and their local ordering in multicomponent lung surfactant monolayers. I will
use AFM-IR to examine the hypothesis that cholesterol concentrates at domain boundaries to lower the line
tension while palmitic acid and hexadecanol promote crystallization of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, increasing
the fraction of solid phase in the monolayer. Successful completion of this project will provide a detailed
description of the two-dimensional chemical distribution in laterally phase separated lung surfactant monolayers
and how this phase separation influences the minimum surface tension at monolayer collapse."
10932873,"ABSTRACT: Immunoprofiling of Opioid Use Disorder Patients to inform structure-guided design of opioid-
specific monoclonal antibodies
The opioid use disorder (OUD) and opioid-related overdoses are a national emergency. Over >100,000
overdose deaths occurred in the period between April 2020 and April 2021, which are largely driven by fentanyl
alone or mixed with other opioids or psychostimulants. Since the initiation of the COVID-19 pandemic, there
has been an increase in non-fatal overdoses requiring hospitalization. These statistics clearly indicate that
approved pharmacotherapies are not sufficient in preventing or treating OUD and opioid overdose. Antigen-
specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are isolated from the antigen, or by vaccine-induced polyclonal antibody
response. Compared to conventional treatment methods based upon small molecule-based
pharmacotherapies targeting the brain mu opioid receptor (MOR), mAbs bind and form a complex with the drug
molecule in circulation. Hence, administration of mAbs impedes drugs from crossing blood-brain-barrier
through sequestration of the molecules, blunting their CNS effects. Compared to MOR-ligands, mAb offer
longer lasting efficacy and no interference with off-target drugs. Therefore, the proposing study focuses on:
1) functional characterization of the human opioid-specific B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire paired with isolation
of opioid-specific mAb; 2) structure-guided design of humanized and human mAbs with greater efficacy and
selectivity. The research approach will involve complementary strategies to identify potential mAb candidates
including next-generation sequencing based-BCR sequencing, antibody display and antibody engineering, to
validate the hypothesis that pairing OUD- or vaccine-induced BCR genetic variability with structure-guided
antibody design will identify mAb with greater therapeutic potential. Moreover, the proposed study will inform
us of how OUD and vaccination introduces antigen-specific genetic perturbations in BCRs. With knowledge of
antibody structure, the result of this study will lead to generation of mAbs with improved affinity. To achieve
these goals, AIM 1 delineates the evolution of human BCR repertoire in OUD patients who are immunized with
a conjugated oxycodone-specific vaccine in Phase I clinical trials (NCT04458545) and unimmunized OUD
patients. AIM 2 tests the relevance of the opioid-specific Fab structure to the mAb efficacy and selectivity. The
results of the study will expand our understanding on the human opioid-specific antibody and B cell repertoire,
supporting structural-based antibody engineering to generate mAbs with high affinity. Moreover, the results can
accelerate the development of antibody-based strategy as an alternative and complementary solution treating
opioid overdose."

Trauma can contribute to the development of dampened reward processing (anhedonia) and disrupted cognitive
control, which are precipitants and perpetuators of symptoms in mental health disorders. The neurophysiological
underpinnings of trauma-related anhedonia and cognitive control deficits has previously been examined using
cross-sectional approaches, including electroencephalography (EEG) studies demonstrating that activity in theta
(~4-7 Hz) and alpha (~8-14 Hz) frequency bands are aberrant in patients with anhedonia and cognitive control
deficits. To build upon this prior work and increase the translational value of these findings, one next step is to
examine how these cortical dynamics vary within a sample of trauma-exposed people to examine how individual
differences in symptom presentation relate to neurophysiology. Further, testing how these dynamics change
throughout a mindfulness-based intervention could reveal novel mechanisms of response to this intervention.
Thus, changes in theta/alpha activity could relate to response to a novel transdiagnostic treatment for trauma-
exposed people called vibroacoustically-augmented breath focused mindfulness (VABFM). VABFM uses a
unique device that vibrates in concert with respiration, which is expected to enhance stimulus sensitivity and
efficiently engage attentional control networks, but no studies to date have examined relevant neurophysiological
mechanisms. The proposed study will leverage data from an ongoing mechanistic clinical trial of mindfulness-
based treatment for trauma-exposed people (R01AT011267) who complete VABFM or a control intervention.
100 participants from this study will complete EEG recordings concurrent with eight bi-weekly intervention
sessions, and participants will also complete pre- and post-study structural and functional magnetic resonance
imaging (sMRI/fMRI) scans. Each sMRI scan will be used for co-registration for EEG source localization analyses
of theta/alpha activity. Source-localized cortical maps will be used to accomplish the following specific aims: (1)
characterize neurophysiological correlates of anhedonia and cognitive control deficits in trauma-exposed people
and (2) Identify neurophysiological mechanisms of VABFM treatment response relevant to anhedonia and
cognitive control in trauma-exposed people. Additionally, an exploratory aim will test congruence between
fMRI/EEG measures of anhedonia and cognitive control deficits in trauma-exposed people by using fMRI data
collected during performance of an affective cognitive control task, which includes reward-related stimuli. This
research will improve our understanding of the neurophysiology of anhedonia and cognitive control deficits in
trauma-exposed people with mental health disorders, and it will demonstrate how changes in symptoms relate
to changes in the underlying neurophysiology of reward/attention networks. Overall, these data provide a unique
opportunity for comprehensive neurophysiological phenotyping of anhedonia and cognitive control deficits in
trauma-exposed people and to identify neurophysiological mechanisms of a novel attentional control treatment.
This will delineate individual differences in brain mechanisms of mental health disorders and will guide treatment."

Failure to form and store long-term memories is a feature of cognitive decline in aging and neurodegeneration.
Experts predict that the prevalence of cognitive impairment, ranging from mild to severe dementia, will increase
alongside the rapidly growing U.S. population of older adults aged 65 and older, creating new challenges to
provide resources and care for older adults. There is a need to understand the epigenetic and molecular
mechanisms of memory formation in the aging brain to develop early intervention strategies and preserve
cognitive function in old age. As observed in our lab and others, histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) is a powerful
epigenetic regulator of memory formation and synaptic plasticity. However, mechanisms regulating HDAC3 in
the aging brain with regards to memory remain undefined. Emerging data suggesting that HDAC3 may be
regulated in cancer cells by upstream kinases and phosphatases led me to hypothesize that the phosphorylation
state of HDAC3 determines the ability of HDAC3 to regulate memory formation and synaptic plasticity.
Furthermore, that the mechanism of HDAC3 phosphorylation becomes dysregulated during memory
consolidation in the aging brain, contributing to age-related memory impairments. Preliminary data in this
proposal reveals that baseline levels of phospho-HDAC3 are reduced in the hippocampus of aging mice (18-mo)
compared to young adult mice (3-mo). Additionally, I developed HDAC3 mutant viral constructs to test the
function of phosphorylated HDAC3 (phospho-mimic) and de-phosphorylated HDAC3 (phospho-null) in memory
formation and synaptic plasticity in the young adult and aging brain. Preliminary results demonstrate that viral
expression of the HDAC3 phospho-mimic impairs memory formation and synaptic plasticity in young adult mice.
However, expression of the HDAC3 phospho-null in aging mice ameliorated age-related impairments in memory
formation and synaptic plasticity. Together, these findings suggest that HDAC3 phosphorylation is a mechanism
that can dynamically regulate long-term memory and synaptic function. Therefore, this proposal will focus on
continuing to investigate the epigenetic regulation of HDAC3 phosphorylation on memory formation in the adult
and aging male and female brain. Specific aims within this proposal will determine the following: Aim 1, determine
the role of HDAC3 phosphorylation in the young adult brain; Aim 2, determine the role of HDAC3 phosphorylation
in the aging brain; Aim 3, determine the mechanism by which HDAC3 phosphorylation regulates memory
formation in the young adult and aging brain. Findings from this project will potentially elucidate a novel
mechanism of HDAC3 epigenetic regulation in memory that can have a fundamental impact for all aging
individuals with cognitive impairments. This training fellowship will allow for development of molecular,
physiology and bioinformatics expertise. With the guidance of Dr. Wood and the research and professional
environment at UCI, this fellowship will provide a foundation for successful career as an independent investigator
focused on understanding the epigenetic mechanisms underlying learning and memory in the aging brain."

Despite recent technological advances, people still suffer from communication difficulties that impact their
professional, social, and family lives, as well as their mental health. People with sensorineural hearing loss
(SNHL) struggle with understanding speech, particularly in noisy situations. In fact, people with similar degrees
of clinically defined hearing loss can have a wide range of speech-recognition abilities, likely due to differences
in underlying suprathreshold deficits that are hidden from current audiological assessment. Although a listener’s
sensitivity to simultaneously spectrally and temporally modulated (STM) sounds is known to be predictive of
speech-in-noise performance in individual listeners, the underlying mechanisms of this predictive power remain
a topic of active debate. Physiological evidence from our lab and others demonstrate that several forms of SNHL
(e.g., OHC and/or IHC dysfunction) affect within and across-channel modulation coding of signals in different
ways. For example, distorted tonotopy due to OHC dysfunction can affect the perceptually relevant within-
channel signal-to-noise ratio in the modulation domain, as well as across-channel temporal coherence of
modulations that are useful for source segregation. Despite these clear and varied implications for modulation
coding of signals, these effects are surprisingly understudied with respect to signal-in-noise coding, which is the
focus of the proposed work. We use a cross-species experimental design to collect anatomical, single-unit
AN-fiber, evoked-response, and diagnostic data from several pre-clinical chinchilla models of SNHL, as well as
evoked-response, diagnostic, psychophysical, and speech-in-noise data from human listeners spanning a range
of age and hearing status. Aim 1 is to characterize SNHL effects on within-channel modulation masking,
where the data collected will test the hypothesis that OHC and IHC dysfunction each degrade the perceptually
relevant neural modulation signal-to-noise ratio, but in distinct ways. Aim 2 is to characterize SNHL effects on
across-channel temporal coherence cues, where the data collected will test the hypothesis that distorted
tonotopy is prevalent in both animals and human listeners and has a perceptually relevant effect on peripheral
across-channel temporal coherence. Aim 3 is to characterize SNHL effects on STM sensitivity, where our cross-
species data will test the hypothesis that the predictive power of STM stimuli for speech-in-noise perception
arises largely from distorted tonotopy and the effects of SNHL on temporal modulation coding, rather than from
broadened tonotopic tuning or degraded temporal precision. Data will be harmonized in an open-source data-
science framework to facilitate future causal modeling by us and others. Our unique ability to quantitatively
synergize cross-species data within a rigorous perceptually relevant framework will allow us to test our general
hypothesis that SNHL has several distinct peripheral effects on modulation cues for signals in noise, which
contribute to individual differences in speech perception in noise. Long-term, this work will help to personalize
audiology by providing knowledge to stratify the clinical SNHL category in a framework of real-world significance."
10886811,"Screening for prostate cancer saves lives but results in an overwhelming number of men being subjected to
unnecessary, invasive prostate biopsies, and the risk of over diagnosis and treatment of indolent cancer. Multi-
parametric MRI (mpMRI) of the prostate and molecular biomarkers are used to evaluate the risk of clinically
significant prostate cancer (csPCa) and need for biopsy, however they are limited in their accuracy for detecting
csPCa, resulting in many men still needing to undergo biopsy for fear of missing a significant tumor. This proposal
addresses an important issue in enhancing the precision of csPCa detection to reduce the burdens of prostate
cancer screening. Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) that are released into body fluids by cancer cells are promising
biomarkers for liquid biopsy since they can be extracted from blood and urine and carry molecular constituents
reflecting the parent tumor. The problem is selectively extracting EVs released from prostate cancers can be
challenging, and contribution by EVs of non-prostate origin can lessen detection and specificity. In collaboration
with the research and development team at Exosome Diagnostics, who are experts in the field of clinical-grade
EV biomarker analysis, we have developed a method to enrich for EVs expressing the Prostate Specific
Membrane Antigen (PSMA) surface protein. We have found that PSMA EV capture enrichment results in the
detection of a different, and potentially more prostate specific profile of EV mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs.
However while EV contents are well protected by lipid membranes, optimal conditions for the collection and
processing of EVs expressing PSMA surface protein have not yet been rigorously defined. In our proposed
project, we will focus on development of a urine PSMA EV assay that is more specific for csPCa than the other
currently available tests for PCa. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that the urine EVs obtained by PSMA
enrichment can provide a panel of EV RNA markers that can substantially enhance prostate cancer risk
assessment. In Specific Aim 1, we have developed an innovative multi-factor assay development plan to address
previous limitations in the rigor and reproducibility of surface antigen capture and develop an optimal workflow
for PSMA enrichment. In Specific Aim 2, we will conduct RNAseq comprehensive profiling of PSMA enriched
and total EVs from men in an ongoing U Miami (MDSelect: NCT04240327) clinical trial enrolling 250 patients
undergoing biopsy for evaluation of csPCa to determine the additive value of PSMA enrichment over total EVs
for csPCa detection. In Specific Aim 3, we will develop and validate a novel urinary EV signature to enhance the
accuracy of csPCa detection using RNAseq data from PSMA enriched and total EVs, with multi-institutional
validation in an ongoing NCI EDRN (NCT03784924) clinical trial. Based on our preliminary data and the
combined expertise of our research team we are well positioned to develop and deliver an EV based urine
biomarker assay that significantly enhances csPCa detection with validation in clinical trials. This proposal will
substantially enhance csPCa detection and lay the foundation for future EV based prostate cancer markers."

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a complex genetic cardiac disorder that affects ~1/300 – 1/500
individuals worldwide. A common clinical manifestation of patients with HCM is an impairment in left ventricular
relaxation (diastolic dysfunction). Beta-adrenergic stimulation is a key regulator of diastolic performance.
During beta- adrenergic stimulation protein kinase A (PKA) mediates phosphorylation of a variety of sarcomeric
targets, including cardiac troponin I (cTnI) at serine 23/24 (Ser23/24). This phosphorylation event results in a
significant increase in relaxation (or de-activation) rates at the myofilament level. Previous work has shown that
this observation is due to increases in calcium dissociation rate from the cardiac thin filament. Additionally,
some thin filament HCM mutations have been shown to exhibit an impaired response to phosphorylation of
Ser23/24 in ATPase assays and force-pCa measurements. While extensive work by several groups has
investigated the structural basis for this increase in calcium dissociation rate, all previous studies, to the best of
our knowledge, lack the key thin filament binding partners actin and tropomyosin, crucial components for
allosteric regulation of relaxation. In this proposal we will perform TR-FRET experiments to assess both
intramolecular and intermolecular interactions between the N-terminus of cTnI and C-terminus of cTnI and the
N-terminus of cTnI and Site II of cTnC in the presence and absence of phosphorylation at Ser23/24. The
experimental design will provide distances that we will employ in our atomistic thin filament model. We will then
use stopped flow fluorescence anisotropy in order to probe transitions in dynamic behavior in the C-terminus of
cTnI when Ser23/24 is phosphorylated as calcium dissociates from the cardiac thin filament. We hypothesize
that phosphorylation of Ser23/24 will alter the rate at which these transitions occur and that these mechanisms
may be altered by HCM causative mutations. To explore the possibility that the degree of observed diastolic
impairment (and potentially the severity of the end HCM phenotype) may be mutation-specific, we propose to
investigate the molecular effects of 3 independent known cTnI mutations at residue R145 in cTnI. This
mutational hotspot includes HCM- linked mutations R145G, R145Q and the restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM)
mutation R145W. We will couple structural data from TR-FRET experiments to changes in calcium dissociation
rate to investigate how structural changes impact function and if the diastolic dysfunction is additive in the
presence of Ser23/24 phosphorylation. We will employ metadynamics simulations to obtain free energy
changes and identify specific changes in interactions that occur from these mutations and phosphorylation as
well as in the two calcium states (on and off). The in-vitro—in-silico coupled approaches proposed in this
application will provide atomic level resolution of the structural changes that occur upon Ser23/24
phosphorylation in the WT state and in the context of known cTnI-linked HCM/RCM mutations, with a long-term
goal of identifying targetable disease mechanisms."
10979141,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Healthy joints are important for everyday activities and the leading cause of disability is osteoarthritis.
Ligament injury resolves with fibrous scar tissue that destabilizes the joint due to inferior scar tissue. There are
no adequate treatments to address this problem due to the limited capacity of our ligamentocytes to regenerate
native tissue. Current models used to study ligament repair experience fibrotic healing and are insufficient in
addressing this challenge to regenerate. Our lab has developed a novel zebrafish model to study the basic
biology underlying interopercular mandibular (IOM) craniofacial ligament regeneration. Our preliminary data
shows that after IOM transection, zebrafish regenerate a scar-free ligament within a month. We show that
ligamentocytes dedifferentiate and contribute to the regenerated ligament. This tightly regulated regenerative
response is characterized by constant crosstalk between the dynamically changing extracellular matrix (ECM)
and the different cell populations present in the injury microenvironment. For comparative analysis, we have
developed a legumain (lgmn) mutant zebrafish model that experiences fibrotic healing to gain insight into the
molecular and cellular regulation of regeneration vs. fibrosis. Lgmn is a cysteine protease involved in ECM
remodeling and we show that lgmn mutants heal with a mis-patterned, scarred ligament after transection. In
contrast to WT regeneration, lgmn mutant fibrotic healing is characterized by a defect in ligamentocyte
dedifferentiation, failure to integrate new and old tissue, and disorganized collagen throughout the course of
ligament healing. To investigate the role of Lgmn-mediated regeneration, this proposal will identify the subcellular
localization and molecular mechanism of Lgmn in the context of craniofacial ligament regeneration. Additionally,
this proposal will also characterize the proteomic profile of the zebrafish IOM ligament during homeostasis,
regeneration, and fibrosis. This will yield new knowledge on differentially expressed proteins during these
different states that can be used to identify potent molecular regulators of a pro-regenerative microenvironment.
Our preliminary scRNAseq analysis shows a subset of macrophages at the injury site that express ECM
remodeling factors including lgmn. Following IOM transection, lgmn mutants have less macrophages present at
the injury site. Together, this indicates an important role of macrophage-derived lgmn in mediating a pro-
regenerative microenvironment. To test this, I plan to use scRNAseq to characterize changes in macrophage
subsets between WT and lgmn mutants. Further, I will functionally test lgmn mutant macrophages and use
adoptive macrophage transfer to test if lgmn mutant scarred healing is rescued. Through these aims, I will
uncover the role of Lgmn in mediating the injury microenvironment during ligament regeneration. Under
the mentorship of Dr. Joanna Smeeton and Dr. Laura Johnston along with their combined expertise in zebrafish
joint biology and genetics, I will be well prepared for my next role as a post-doctoral fellow. The training plan
outlined will help me develop the necessary skills to succeed as an independent craniofacial research scientist."

Inhibitory GABAergic neurons comprise only about 15% of all neurons in the brain yet their activity
is critical for all aspects of brain function and GABA neuron dysfunction is implicated in many
neurological disorders and mental illnesses. In particular, inhibition likely plays a unique and
important role in hippocampal area CA3. In the CA3 region, DG neurons synapse onto CA3
pyramidal neurons via giant excitatory mossy fiber terminals and CA3 neurons make many
recurrent connections. Thus, the potential for runaway excitation in CA3 is high. Feed-forward
inhibition from DG to CA3 is thought to be critical allow specific excitatory inputs to generate
meaningful activity patterns. Despite the likely importance of inhibition in hippocampal area CA3,
few studies have directly examined how GABA neuron activity controls CA3 pyramidal neuron
activity. We identified a group of dendrite-targeting GABA neurons that commonly express the
synaptogenic protein Kirrel3. Kirrel3 protein is necessary to form MF filopodia synapses, a special
type of excitatory synapse that connects DG neurons to GABA neurons and mediates feed-
forward inhibition to CA3. Because Kirrel3 must be expressed in both the pre- and post-synaptic
neuron to make a synapse, it strongly suggests Kirrel3-expressingn GABA neurons are direct
targets of MF filopodia and the study of K3-GABA neurons will shed light on the precise function
of MF filopodia-mediated inhibition in CA3. We will test this in three aims spanning ultrastructural
analysis to large-scale functional cell imaging to behavior. Throughout, we will examine the
selectivity of this group of dendrite-targeting GABA neurons by comparing their function to soma-
targeting neurons that do not express Kirrel3. Regardless of outcome, our results are expected
advance our understanding of GABA neuron activity in learning and memory and could provide a
new framework for studying GABA neurons that share synaptic connectivity genes."

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a deadly malignancy with limited treatment options, and lacks molecular-
targeted therapies. Activation of Wnt/β-catenin cascade has been shown to play a major role during HCC
pathogenesis. Mutations in CTNNB1, the gene encoding for β-catenin, interfere with its degradation leading to
its gain-of function (GOF) and activation, and are implicated in 20-35% of all HCCs. A mutually exclusive group
of additional around 8% of HCCs is the one with the loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in AXIN1, which encodes
for a scaffolding protein AXIN1, essential for β-catenin degradation. Our previous studies also showed that β-
catenin activation alone is insufficient for HCC development. Based on the concomitant presence of CTNNB1
mutations and c-MET activation in ~11% of human HCC, and the presence of LOF mutations in AXIN1 and c-
MET activation together in ~4% of human HCC, we established two murine HCC models, c-Met/β-catenin and
c-Met/sgAxin1, using sleeping beauty transposon/transposase and hydrodynamic tail vein injection (SB-HDTVI).
These models recapitulate the respective human HCC subsets based on gene expression studies. Intriguingly,
using these mouse models and human HCC samples, we discovered that AXIN1 LOF mutant HCC does not
show activation of canonical liver-specific β-catenin target genes such as glutamine synthetase (Gs) and Tbx3,
which was evident in CTNNB1-mutant HCCs. In contrast, Hippo cascade is inactivated in LOF mutations in
AXIN1 mutant, but not in CTNNB1-mutant HCCs. Based on the above observations, our overarching hypothesis
is that despite β-catenin being the common downstream effector, mutations in CTNNB1 and AXIN1 lead to
distinct molecular subtypes of HCC, and tumor development in these two classes requires participation of distinct
signaling pathways. We propose the following three specific aims to address our highly relevant hypothesis. In
Aim 1, we plan to define whether ligand dependent activation of Wnt/β-catenin is required for c-Met/sgAxin1
induced HCC formation in mice. In Aim 2, we will investigate Gs dependent and independent metabolic and
signaling cascades in mouse HCC development. And in Aim 3, we will characterize the functional contribution of
Hippo cascade in Ctnnb1 GOF and Axin1 LOF mutant HCCs. Altogether, our studies will elucidate the distinct
signaling pathways induced by β-catenin activation due to two distinct mechanisms, and how we may effectively
target these tumors based on genetic variations. The proposal represents an ongoing & productive collaboration
between Dr. Xin Chen from UCSF and Dr. Paul Monga from University of Pittsburgh. The results may pave a
way for precision medicine in HCC."

 The overarching goal of this K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award is to
provide essential skills and mentored research experience to prepare Dr. Girish Hiremath as an independent
investigator leading a multi-disciplinary team of researchers focused on eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). EoE is
a chronic, allergen-mediated, inflammatory condition of the esophagus. As one of the most common cause of
upper gastrointestinal morbidity, it affects 1 out of 2000 individuals in the United States. Our understanding of
the pathogenesis of EoE is incomplete and this has contributed towards burdensome approaches to treat EoE
patients. There is a critical unmet need to understand all factors related with development of EoE, including
determining the biochemical changes in the esophagus that leads to transformation of an unaffected
esophagus to an inflamed esophagus in EoE. As a Pediatric Gastroenterologist with clinical and research
focus on EoE for more than a decade, the candidate proposes to fill this important knowledge gap by building
on his published work through: 1) Validating the esophageal biochemical changes in EoE using Raman
spectroscopy (a uniquely suited, highly sensitive, laser-based technique) and machine learning, 2) Determining
the correlation between the Raman peaks and the disease activity, and the operating characteristics of the key
Raman peaks in distinguishing EoE activity states, and 3) Determining if a combination of the baseline Raman,
histologic, endoscopic, and clinical features can predict response to EoE therapy. By defining the key
esophageal biochemical alterations this study will offer novel insights into pathogenesis of EoE, and by
identifying the baseline predictors of the treatment response it will lay a framework for personalized care of
EoE patients. This cutting-edge and clinically relevant research will be conducted in an intellectually stimulating
and supportive environment at the Vanderbilt University. Throughout the award period, the candidate will be
mentored by Dr. Anita Mahadevan-Jansen (primary mentor, expert in Raman Spectroscopy), Dr. Evan Dellon
(co-mentor, expert in EoE), and a team of exceptional mentors in pathology, allergic inflammation, biostatistics
and bioinformatics, and data science who mirror the blend of researchers that the candidate will lead in the
future Their distinguished career paths will serve as a template for the candidate's success. To achieve his
long-term career goal, in conjunction with his mentoring team, the candidate has methodically carved out a 4-
year career development program. This program will provide him essential skills in Raman spectroscopy,
integration of multidimensional biomedical data, clinical translational research, EoE, grant writing, and
leadership. The preeminent mentorship, rigorous career development plan, and clinical time under the
auspices of this K23 award will lead to publications, data, and experience that will uniquely situate the
candidate as an independent investigator at the intersection of EoE, biophotonics, and data science."

 Kentucky's high radon potential and high smoking rates create the perfect storm for the
overrepresentation of lung cancer cases. Our transdisciplinary, community-academic team-led project,
Radon on the RADAR (Residents Acting to Detect and Alleviate Radon) will address community concerns
about lung cancer by identifying geological and atmospheric conditions that increase radon intrusion into
homes, translating this knowledge into greater residential awareness of risk, enabling home radon testing
and report back, and growing access to affordable and adequate radon mitigation. We will team geologists
with citizen scientists to determine how new radon detection technology (i.e., Airthings) compares to
traditional charcoal kits and outdoor soil radon measurements over a range of atmospheric and geological
conditions to close a critical knowledge gap in our understanding of radon risk. The study will build
capacity in environmental health by: (a) training citizens in rigorous data collection and interpretation of
findings; (b) engaging these citizen scientists in creating and promoting library loan programs to increase
radon testing; and (c) creating sustainable environmental health action plans to alleviate radon exposure
in rural communities. Our overall hypothesis is that by increasing knowledge on how geological and
atmospheric conditions can impact radon, partnering with citizen scientists to use new radon detection
technology and translate the data, and by growing access to low-cost radon mitigation, we will reduce
radon risk. Aim 1 will use a citizen science approach to identify and train 60 community residents in four
KY counties to test for radon and evaluate change in environmental health literacy (EHL) and self-efficacy.
Aim 2 will compare indoor home radon values and soil radon values over time, controlling for atmospheric
conditions, seasonality, geology, topography, and smoking in the home. Aim 3 will create and evaluate a
pilot radon detector library loan program with 400 homeowners in the four counties. Aim 4 will launch the
radon detector loan program and examine changes in home testing and accessing geologically based
radon potential maps. Aim 5 will examine the impact of citizen scientist-led radon coalitions on reach,
effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance, and environmental health literacy. The RADAR
study challenges and expands the current environmental health science paradigm by collaborating with
geologists and integrating their scientific approach. We will impact community concerns about high lung
cancer rates by: 1) transforming radon detection and report back using geoscience and new radon gas
detection technology; 2) developing a library-lending approach to increase radon testing; and 3) supporting
environmental action by creating and sustaining citizen science-led radon coalitions that share new
knowledge and engage health advocates, radon mitigation professionals, policymakers, builders, and
developers to promote improved radon management in rural Kentucky."

 Fungal species are among the most common causes of nosocomial bloodstream and invasive infections in
immunocompromised hosts. Mortality from candidemia can be very high, ranging from 20-40%. Cryptococcus
affects approximately 2-3% of solid organ transplant patients and Cryptococcus gattii has emerged as a new
cause of pneumonia and disseminated fungal disease. The global emergence of virulent multidrug resistant
species such as Candida auris, with a mortality reported to be as high as 68% is particularly worrisome. Culture-
based tests to detect Candida infections are slow, relatively insensitive, and may have difficulty distinguishing
between C. auris and other related Candida species. Lateral flow antigen tests for Cryptococcus have high
sensitivity and specificity but Cryptococcal antigen detection is available only as a standalone assay that is not
part of a larger fungal panel; thus, Cryptococcus infections may be missed in the absence of clinical suspicion.
Nucleic acid amplification based Candida assays do not have the sensitivity required to detect a Candida
infection directly from a patient blood sample (without pre-culture amplification) except for the T2Candida test
(based on magnetic resonance technology), which is prohibitively expensive, slow, low throughput and is only
able to distinguish among a limited number of Candida species. A more widely available, more rapid and user
friendly, and less expensive test for fungal blood stream infections has the potential to greatly impact patient
care and improve infection control. This proposal will take advantage of years of successful collaborations
between the Alland laboratory and Cepheid developing point of care diagnostic assays, including new
approaches to large blood volume sample processing and ultra-sensitive DNA sequence detection. We will
leverage this experience to create a fungal detection assay with unparalleled performance. Our specific aims
are: 1) Assay development. 2) Improved sample processing to maximize test blood volume and enhance assay
sensitivity. 3) Development and testing using dried reagent beads. 4) Perform analytic and pre-clinical studies in
preparation for large-scale clinical trials."

overdose (OOD) but have less engagement of medications for OUD (MOUD) and other OUD
treatments than other Veterans, resulting in unemployment and homelessness - predictors of
reoffending. Many Veterans in VTCs, particularly those with an OUD have multiple social
determinants of health (SDOH) issues that need to be addressed simultaneously. Adverse
SDOH have been identified as key barriers to MOUD engagement and increasing risk of OOD.
We have identified 8 modifiable SDOH (mSDOH)¾job insecurity, housing insecurity, financial

beyond traditional linkage support provided through VJP. It offers Veterans 6 months of
psychosocial treatment combined with assertive outreach, empowering clients to access and
engage in care and community services to address addiction, mental health and other mSDOH

natural language processing (NLP) approaches, and then incorporate these mSDOH to improve
prediction of vulnerable Veterans in VJP with poor MOUD engagement and OOD. SoS-
MISSION addresses untreated addiction as listed as one focus in the National Drug Control

training of caregivers, which can leave informal caregivers underprepared for performing assisted transfers.
When training is provided, clinicians currently have no objective way to assess transfer technique. For this
reason, an outcome measure called the Caregiver Assisted Transfer Technique Instrument (CATT) was
developed to provide a quick, objective way to evaluate proper technique of caregivers who provide transfer
assistance to individuals with disabilities. The CATT was formally assessed for its content validity through
stakeholder review involving clinicians, informal caregivers, and individuals with physical disabilities who
require transfer assistance. The specific aims of the study are to 1) establish the CATT's intra- and interrater
reliability in evaluating the quality of informal caregiver assisted transfer techniques, 2) establish the CATT's
construct and concurrent validity through relating the scores to caregiver characteristics and the biomechanical
measurement of caregiver techniques and, and 3) demonstrate improvement in the quality of assisted transfer
technique after individualized training with caregivers who have deficits on the CATT. Eighty caregiver and
care recipient dyads will be recruited to participate in a study to establish the CATT's measurement properties.
Caregivers and care recipient participants will complete demographic surveys and surveys on their general
health. Caregivers will be fitted with inertial measurement units (IMU) and pressure insoles to capture body
mechanics during transfers. The dyads will perform a series of four assisted transfers while three trained
rehabilitation professionals rate their transfer skills using the CATT over two visits. Dyads who have transfer
skill deficits will be enrolled in a portion of the study to determine if an individualized training based on CATT
principles can improve transfer techniques. An experienced clinician will observe the dyad's transfers and then
educate and train the caregiver on how to improve their transfer technique. After practice, the dyad will perform
the transfer protocol again, and CATT scores and biomechanics data from IMU and pressure insoles will be
used to determine if transfer technique improved after training. At the end of this project, we expect to deliver a
psychometrically sound version of the CATT that can be used in both clinical and non-clinical settings to 1)
identify specific issues or deficits with assisted transfer technique, 2) identify specific areas to target
educational or training interventions, and 3) provide an objective indicator for the level of risk associated with
assisted transfers."
10747836,"Peripheral nerve damage is a debilitating consequence of traumatic or iatrogenic injury to the extremities of
soldiers, and a secondary outcome following spinal cord injury (SCI). Functional recovery from nerve damage is
often poor, especially for chronically injured nerves, resulting in impaired motor function, sensory loss, and pain.
Beyond the direct impacts of nerve injury, systemic effects related to nerve damage are additionally devastating.
One particularly insidious and unsolved clinical challenge resulting from nerve injury is a reduction in the
structural integrity and strength of bone. This is in part due to reduced bone loading due to motor dysfunction.
However, increasing evidence highlights strong coupling among bone innervation (sensory and sympathetic),
vascularity, and regulation of bone turnover. Beyond increased risk of fracture, bone degeneration can also
impact whole-body homeostasis, including hematopoiesis and downstream immune dysfunction. Given such
long-term sequelae of chronic nerve injury, Veterans bear a tremendous burden on their quality of life, and the
VA healthcare system bears a corresponding financial challenge.
 Imaging is an important strategy for evaluating bone health after nerve injury, nerve repair, and rehabilitative
intervention. Unfortunately, existing techniques are limited. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), which
quantifies bone mineral density (BMD), is considered the standard of care in clinical practice. However, the
majority of bone components, including the organic matrix and water, which together occupy approximately 60%
of bone by volume, is inaccessible using current approaches. These “invisible” tissue components make
important contributions to the mechanical properties of bone, partially explaining why BMD alone poorly predicts
fractures or other bone-related complications. Further, there is no opportunity to non-invasively measure
biological correlates of bone health such as vascularity. These shortcomings contribute strongly to the lack of
current interventional approaches to preserve or restore bone health.
 In this study, we propose to apply innovative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to interrogate several
structural and physiological properties of bone following nerve injury and rehabilitative intervention. In particular,
we will develop and apply quantitative ultrashort echo time (UTE) MRI techniques to measure multi-scale
features of bone, including macro- and micro-scale structure and micro-scale vascularity. Our specific aims are:
1) To evaluate changes in bone morphology and neurovascular supply during the progression of chronic nerve
injury; 2) To evaluate changes in bone morphology and neurovascular supply following repair of acute and
chronic nerve injury; 3) To evaluate changes in bone morphology and neurovascular supply following treadmill-
based rehabilitation following chronic nerve injury and repair.
 The primary outcome of our proposed study is to validate the utility of novel imaging approaches in measuring
key aspects of bone structure and bone health following nerve injury, repair, and rehabilitation. A secondary
outcome of this study is to better understand neurovascular and muscular biological changes that underlie bone
degeneration and imaging outcomes, thus providing a more mechanistic rationale for additional therapeutic or
rehabilitative intervention. Towards improved bone health following nerve injury, our ultimate goal is to identify
MRI biomarkers that may then be deployed clinically, to non-invasively evaluate the effectiveness of rehabilitative
strategies on bone composition and strength following severe nerve injury."
11020936,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Elucidation of a newly characterized clonal bone marrow and autoinflammatory disease, VEXAS Syndrome,
prompts re-examination of the master regulator of ubiquitylation, UBA1. VEXAS stands for Vacuoles, E1, X-
linked, Autoinflammatory, Somatic syndrome and presents with disparate inflammatory (e.g. relapsing
polychondritis, vasculitides) and hematologic (e.g. pancytopenia, myelodysplastic syndrome) conditions. The
disease is present in 1:4000 men over the age of 50 and has a 40% mortality rate. Current therapeutic treatment
is limited to high dose corticosteroids. In affected patients, acquired or somatic variants in the UBA1 gene are
present in hematopoietic stem cells (HPSCs) and become lineage restricted to myeloid cells. VEXAS presents
primarily in elderly males as UBA1 is located on the X-chromosome. UBA1 encodes the primary ubiquitin (Ub)
activating enzyme (E1), accounting for over 97% of all downstream ubiquitylation. Protein ubiquitylation occurs
via a tightly regulated enzymatic cascade where sequential activation of E1 to Ub-conjugating enzyme (E2) to
Ub-ligase (E3) enzymes ultimately leads to substrate ubiquitylation. Prior studies have predominantly focused
on the role of E3 ligases in disease progression due to their protein-specific targeting in ubiquitylation. Far less
is known regarding the role of UBA1 in disease pathogenesis. Notably, VEXAS highlights the importance of
UBA1 in maintaining immune homeostasis and driving clonal blood disease. Through transcriptomic and cytokine
profiling approaches, our group has identified mutant myeloid cells as the primary drivers of inflammation
although the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here I propose to determine the mechanism of VEXAS
using unbiased approaches. Despite UBA1 mutation present in HSPCs, the mutation is lineage restricted to
myeloid cells and absent in lymphocytes. Our preliminary results utilizing a temperature sensitive cell line
(Chinese Hamster Ovary [CHO] line ts20) suggests VEXAS mutant UBA1 fails to charge the cognate E2s of the
endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation pathway (ERAD), UBE2J1 and UBE2G2, potentially upregulating
the unfolded protein response (UPR). These findings suggest that inappropriate UBA1 expression may both
drive disease in VEXAS and allow selective clonal expansion of a pro-inflammatory myeloid lineage as
potentiated by specific downstream effectors possibly linked to ERAD and UPR. In this study I propose to 1)
perform an unbiased delineation of novel effectors driving UBA1-dependent inflammation pathways and 2)
functionally validate effectors identified through model systems and unbiased approaches through a combination
of small molecule, biologic, and transgenic approaches. My combined studies will not only be important for
elucidating the mechanism of disease and treatment in VEXAS but may also apply to a wider understanding of
key cellular ubiquitylation processes, autoinflammatory disease, and bone marrow-derived diseases."
10954262,"Background: High rates of medical and mental health comorbidities result in elevated risks of poor maternal
and neonatal outcomes among women Veterans compared to their civilian counterparts. Proactive planning
and optimization of physical and mental health prior to pregnancy can mitigate these risks; however, nearly
40% of pregnancies among Veterans are unintended. National guidelines recommend routine delivery of
patient-centered reproductive planning services in primary care, including assessment of reproductive goals
followed by tailored contraceptive and/or preconception counseling, to reduce unintended pregnancy and
improve pregnancy outcomes. Only 38% of women Veterans at risk of pregnancy, however, report having
contraceptive or preconception health discussions with their primary care provider in the past year. We
developed “MyPath,” a novel patient-facing web-based decision support tool, to address gaps in reproductive
planning services in VA primary care. MyPath’s objectives are to help women Veterans consider their
reproductive goals, increase their knowledge, align contraceptive and pregnancy timing decisions with their
goals and health needs, and engage in shared decision making with providers. In pilot testing among 58
Veterans, use of MyPath prior to clinic visits was highly acceptable to Veterans and increased reproductive
planning discussions compared to usual care without increasing providers’ perceived workload. MyPath use
was also associated with increased decision quality and effective contraceptive use. Additional evaluation of
MyPath in a pragmatic randomized trial is needed to assess effectiveness and collect implementation data.
Significance/Impact: Patient-centered, scalable interventions that can enhance delivery of VA reproductive
planning services without creating burden on primary care providers are urgently needed. The MyPath
intervention leverages interactive patient-facing technology to empower women to make high-quality informed
decisions and engage with providers about their reproductive health needs. If found to be successful, MyPath
will lead to increased access to patient-centered reproductive planning services in VA primary care, addressing
key HSR&D priorities, including access, primary care practice, women’s health, and whole health.
Innovation: MyPath is the first online decision support tool designed to promote patient-centered reproductive
planning services in primary care settings and to facilitate high-quality decisions aligned with reproductive
goals. We will deliver the tool using the innovative strategy of partnering with the national VEText program to
send the MyPath link to Veterans before appointments in an automated text message appointment reminder.
Specific Aims: 1) Aim 1 will test the effect of the MyPath tool used before primary care visits on occurrence of
reproductive planning discussions with shared decision making (primary outcome), patient-provider
communication self-efficacy, and contraceptive decision quality, compared to usual care; 2) Aim 2 will test the
longer-term effect of MyPath on contraceptive utilization, unintended pregnancy, and preconception health
behaviors, compared to usual care; 3) Aim 3 is an implementation process evaluation, including quantitative
and qualitative data collection to identify implementation barriers and facilitators and intervention costs.
Methodology: This study is a 3-site hybrid type 1 pragmatic randomized controlled trial clustered at the
provider level among 24 women’s health primary care providers and their reproductive-aged Veteran patients.
We will assess outcomes among a minimum of 342 women Veterans by telephone surveys post-visit and at 3-
and 6-month follow up. We will collect information on barriers and facilitators to implementation using
quantitative and qualitative methods, including interviews with Veterans, providers, and clinic leaders.
Next Steps/Implementation: The pragmatic design, in combination with strong operational partnerships, will
enable rapid translation of research findings into practice if MyPath is found to be effective, with the ultimate
objective of improving reproductive health outcomes and well-being among women Veterans nationally."
10903864,"SUMMARY
 Obesity is a key risk factor for Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Due to the obesity epidemic, the
prevalence of GDM has reached an alarming level. Most importantly, GDM has many adverse effects on
pregnancy outcomes and postpartum maternal and offspring health. Therefore, it is urgent to elucidate the
pathological mechanisms of GDM. Adiponectin is an adipocyte-secreted hormone that improves glucose and
lipid metabolism. Hypoadiponectinemia before pregnancy and during the first and second trimesters strongly
predicts GDM. Our studies from the previous funding period have demonstrated that adiponectin deficiency
causes hyperglycemia and other metabolic abnormalities in pregnant mice. Interestingly, our studies revealed
that adiponectin controls maternal metabolic adaptation by indirectly increasing β-cell proliferation and insulin
production via placental lactogen (PL). However, decreased insulin secretion rates were still observed in size-
matched islets from adiponectin gene knockout (Adipoq-/-) dams indicating additional mechanisms are involved
besides β-cell proliferation. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are well-conserved for intercellular and intra-organ
communication. Pregnancy robustly increases EV levels in maternal circulation, partially attributed to placental-
derived small EVs (psEVs). Consistent with other reports, our preliminary studies observed a stimulative effect
of adiponectin on psEVs production. Importantly, psEVs enhanced glucose-induced insulin secretion of
cultured islets. These data suggest that adiponectin, psEVs, and PL provide a pathway for fat/placenta/islet
intra-organ crosstalk. During the last funding period, our study also identified a crucial role of pancreatic α-cells
in maternal metabolic adaptation. Our study demonstrated that pregnancy increases glucagon-like peptide-1
(GLP-1) production from α-cells and then enhances maternal insulin secretion. A significant reduction of
pancreatic GLP-1 was detected in Adipoq-/- dams. Notably, conditionally knocking out the adiponectin receptor
1 (AdipoR1) gene in α-cells significantly reduced GLP-1 production and glucose tolerance during pregnancy.
Therefore, we hypothesize that adiponectin regulates islet adaptation to pregnancy through both
fat/placenta/islet intra-organ crosstalk and intraislet paracrine. We will use genetic mouse models and human
placenta and islets to 1) define the role of psEVs in adiponectin-regulated islet adaptation to pregnancy; 2)
determine how adiponectin augments maternal insulin production through α-cells. The anticipated success of
this project will have a significant impact on the research of maternal metabolic adaptation."
10916476,"Project Summary AIMM annual meeting – E.M. Shore, P.I.
Advances in Mineral Metabolism (AIMM) is an annual conference of bone and musculoskeletal biology
research in a format that provides extensive opportunities for open discussions and exchange of ideas from
basic, clinical, and translational perspectives. The AIMM meeting has been embraced by a broad spectrum
of scientists and clinicians for more than 35 years to engage in high-quality discussions of state-of-the-art
topics that are the core of the spirit of AIMM. This proposal is for the 2024, 2025, and 2026 AIMM meetings.
Since 1985, the AIMM meeting has been an important and unique scientific meeting, distinguished by
cutting edge reports and intensive scientific discussions. A unique feature of AIMM is to use half of each
presentation time slot for lively and engaging discussion. The AIMM program has consistently maintained
balance in basic research and clinical perspectives and is attended by academics (basic researchers and
clinicians), postdoctoral trainees, and scientists in the pharmaceutical industry.
The 2024 program includes basic science and clinical/translational oral presentations on relevant and new
research on periodontal bone regeneration, muscle-bone communication and aging, translation of stem cell
biology strategies, matricellular proteins in cartilage and bone, and exercise physiology. Presentations by
experts in these areas, as well as by young investigators selected through a competitive process, will be a
focus of the meeting. Invited speakers will lead meet-the-professor discussions on scientific and career
development topics, and a workshop on diversity in bone and mineral research.
In addition to high quality scientific discussion, a major goal of the AIMM meeting is to provide opportunities
for early career stage scientists to interact closely with more established researchers in a welcoming and
interactive environment that fosters creative scientific exchange and encourages their career development.
AIMM accomplishes this in several ways: first, all Young Investigator awardees present their work orally
within the planned scientific sessions; second, the program includes an open basic science session and an
open clinical science session that provide YIs additional opportunities to present recent findings or case
reports; third, each session includes time for extended discussions and encourages YI participation; fourth,
meet-the-professor sessions are unique opportunities for small-group interactions to specifically benefit
scientists-in-training and young faculty; fifth, the meeting format brings attendees together throughout the
day including time for unstructured informal group and individual discussions; finally, a mentor-match
program (initiated in 2020) facilitates one-on-one mentoring discussions with the YIs.
The requested support for the AIMM meetings would be a significant contribution toward fulfilling AIMM’s
goals to stimulate creativity in bone and musculoskeletal research and to provide early career stage
investigators with strong and lasting support to promote and develop their talent.

10754537,"This K01 application proposes career development and research activities customized to facilitate the
candidate's (Dr. Noah Webster) transition from conducting basic social science research to behavioral
intervention research. The candidate's long-term career goals include becoming an independent research
scientist conducting research aimed at: a) improving the health and independence of older adults; and
b) reducing later life health disparities. This will involve developing, testing, implementing, and disseminating a
social network-based intervention to improve participation in behavioral health (e.g., physical activity)
interventions within low resource settings. Career Development/Training Aims: In order to accomplish career
goals the candidate is in need of targeted and interdisciplinary training in: 1) intervention development;
2) intervention evaluation; and 3) objective assessment of physical activity. This training will be facilitated
through coursework and interactions with an interdisciplinary mentoring team led by Dr. Neil Alexander.
Training Environment: The candidate is situated within the largest academically-based social science institute
in the world. The resources available to him at the Institute for Social Research as well as the University of
Michigan's Schools of Medicine and Public Health together offer an unparalleled supportive and stimulating
environment for conducting research at the intersection of social science and intervention research. Research
Aims: While only 16% of people age 65+ engage in recommended physical activity levels, increases may be
achieved through activation of social resources. A social network-based approach that systematically identifies
and involves influential agents of change in a community is proposed to facilitate physical activity-related
information dissemination and behavior change. This project will leverage Go4Life, NIA's evidence-based
physical activity campaign and capitalize on the strength of social ties. The intervention addresses socio-
economically linked health disparities by developing the intervention for use in affordable (HUD subsidized)
senior housing. The project will address three specific aims: Aim 1) Identify agents of change in an affordable
senior housing community who will then be invited to form a committee to disseminate Go4Life materials
through planning, publicizing, and participating in community-wide activities over 12 months. Aim 2) Evaluate
intervention feasibility using a mixed methods approach. Aim 3) Establish preliminary network effect on
changes in physical activity and identify influential network mechanisms. The proposed feasibility study is the
first step in using locally available and low-cost resources to affect behavior change among socio-economically
vulnerable senior housing residents. In the short-term, findings will provide preliminary data to conduct a multi-
site efficacy trial which will implement and evaluate successful components of the intervention. In the long-
term, understanding how to leverage social networks to promote and sustain increases in physical activity will
provide key information to advance the science of behavior change as well as reduce health disparities."
10754538,"Background: Prevalent obesity related conditions like obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) represent an important
opportunity for the VA to improve population health. OSA markedly reduces quality of life and is associated
with 3-fold greater risk for cardiovascular disease. Although obesity is the single greatest reversible risk factor
for OSA, the 1 million Veterans with OSA and obesity rarely receive weight loss care to reverse OSA and other
serious comorbidities. Efficacy trials reinforce that time and resource intensive lifestyle-based weight loss
programs improve weight and physiologic measures of OSA severity (apnea hypopnea index, AHI). However,
there are barriers to translating these findings into meaningful gains for population health. First, VA has limited
capacity to counsel patients around lifestyle change. Less than one-third of Veterans with OSA and obesity are
counseled about weight loss and even fewer are referred to weight loss services. Second, VA’s current weight
loss offerings are difficult to access. Only 12% of Veterans with OSA and obesity utilize MOVE!, and those
referred to MOVE! achieve minimal weight loss—1.2 kg at 1 year. Third, prior weight loss trials focused on
intermediate measures (e.g. AHI), limiting understanding of effectiveness for meaningful outcomes. To meet
these challenges, we propose a pragmatic trial of proactively offering a remote video-based and self-directed
weight loss intervention with telephone-based coaching to Veterans with newly diagnosed OSA. Our weight
loss intervention (D-ELITE) is adapted from a program known to be effective in a non-VA population, with 44%
of participants achieving ≥5% weight loss at 24 months. Further optimizing reach, our remote intervention
includes low-technology options (e.g. DVD videos) to accommodate those with low technology literacy.
Significance: Our research tests a program of proactively providing Veterans with OSA the tools to manage
weight loss in a way that is independent of local provider time and resources. Our research addresses a key
gap in Veteran’s health in a way that aligns with important VA priorities including population health, virtual care,
access, and health care value. We anticipate our intervention can efficiently achieve improvements in quality of
life while reducing the burden and risk of serious comorbidities.
Innovation and Impact: Our research directly challenges the traditional provider-driven model of healthcare
delivery where providers direct care and provide necessary services aimed at managing a single disease.
Instead, we propose to proactively deliver weight loss services to a high-risk group using a population health
approach. In doing so, we will conduct the first trial of remote and self-directed weight loss care in OSA and will
test whether weight loss care can improve meaningful outcomes such as quality of life and cardiovascular risk.
Specific Aims: Our primary aim is to test the effectiveness of a proactively delivered and pragmatic weight
loss intervention to improve co-primary endpoints of sleep-related quality of life and weight among Veterans
with OSA and obesity. Secondarily, we will compare additional outcomes between groups: cardiovascular risk
scores, sleep symptoms, and AHI. Finally, we will also conduct an implementation process evaluation informed
by the RE-AIM framework to identify barriers and facilitators to widespread implementation.
Methodology: We plan a hybrid type 1 pragmatic randomized controlled trial. We will proactively identify
Veterans with OSA and obesity nationwide using data from the CDW (n=696), randomizing 1:1 to usual care
plus the D-ELITE weight loss intervention or usual care alone. We will collect primary outcomes at 12 months,
but we will also collect outcomes at 3 and 24 months to assess trends over time. We will use quantitative and
qualitative methods to assess barriers to implementation, including a comprehensive budget impact analysis.
Next Steps/Implementation: If effective, we will work with our operational partner, the National Center for
Health Promotion and Prevention (NCP), to integrate D-ELITE into NCPs suite of weight loss offerings. The
National Program Office for Pulmonary/Sleep also agrees to promote policies supporting nationwide adoption."
10892294,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Background: Only about 50% of adolescents and young adults with HIV (AYWH) who initiate HIV care remain
in care at 12 months. Moreover, in 2020, AYWH recorded a 50% increase in AIDS-related mortality. These poor
clinical outcomes are multi-factorial and heavily influenced by their neurodevelopmental stage and by route of
infection (perinatal vs non-perinatal). Current interventions to retain AYWH in care are limited and do not address
these key aspects of HIV care for AYWH. Social media-based mobile health (mHealth) interventions offer flexible
and attractive features to AYWH to help overcome barriers to retention in care. Candidate: The goal of the
proposed K43 Emerging Global Leader Award is to support Dr. Julian Adong’s research training to attain
independence as a clinician-scientist focused on improving treatment and care for AYWH in low resourced
settings. Dr. Adong is currently a research fellow at Mbarara University of Science and Technology, Uganda.
The proposed study will enable training in three areas: 1) Qualitative and mixed methods research, including
design, data collection, analysis and interpretation; 2) Behavioural science skills to better understand influences
of adolescent behaviour and implications for mHealth-based intervention development and deployment; and 3)
Statistical methods for clinical trials, including longitudinal data analysis. This application builds on Dr, Adong’s
current clinical experience and background in epidemiology, as well as ongoing formative work in mHealth
intervention development. Research: The research goals of this proposal are to develop and test the feasibility
and acceptability of an adolescent-tailored social media-based mHealth intervention to improve retention in HIV
care for AYWH. The intervention will be informed by Social Cognitive Theory and the Theory of Planned
Behaviour, and the development process will be guided by the IDEAS Framework. First, Dr. Adong will define
the cognitive, environmental, and behavioural challenges among AYWH who are new or newly re-engaging in
HIV care, characterizing these factors by neurodevelopmental stage and route of infection and their impact on
behavioural intention (Aim 1). She will then iteratively develop the intervention with input from AYWH and clinic
counsellors (Aim 2). Finally, she will test the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of the
intervention on one-year retention in care through a pilot wait-list controlled trial among AYWH who are new or
newly re-engaging in HIV care (Aim 3). Innovation: This study will be the first to address the important role of
neurodevelopmental stage and route of infection for retention in care and will leverage the strong potential of
mHealth interventions in this mHealth-receptive population. Future directions: Dr. Adong’s research and
training aims are well aligned and supported by a multidisciplinary team of dedicated mentors. At the end of the
award, she will be an excellent candidate for an R01 application to definitively assess mHealth interventions to
improve HIV treatment outcomes among AYWH in low resourced settings."

 Overnutrition induces insulin resistance, which is a high-risk factor for T2D and NASH. The
mechanism underlying insulin resistance-induced hepatic lipogenesis, fibrosis, apoptosis, and inflammation
for NASH is unclear. High levels of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGFβ1) in blood and tissues were
observed in both human and mice with T2D and NASH. TGF-β1 plays a pivotal role in a diverse range of
cellular responses, including extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis and apoptosis which are essential for
tissue homeostasis, but the molecular mechanism by which TGFβ1 regulates glucose metabolism and liver
function is incompletely understood.
 The forkhead transcription factor Foxo1 is a key downstream target of the insulin→ PI3K→protein
kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway and the glucagon→cAMP→protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway. Akt
phosphorylates Foxo1-Ser253, triggering Foxo1 nuclear export and cytoplasmic sequestration for
ubiquitination. By contrast, PKA phosphorylates Foxo1-Ser273 to promote Foxo1 nuclear translocation and
protein stability in hepatocytes. Upon metabolic stress such as overnutrition, Foxo1 hyperactivation
promotes hepatic glucose production (HGP) and hyperglycemia. In this proposal, the PI hypothesizes that
hepatic TGFβ1 plays key role in control of Foxo1 via phosphorylation at S273 (Foxo1-pS273), enhancing
Foxo1 nuclear activity, and inducing hyperglycemia, liver fibrosis and inflammation, and promoting T2D and
NASH. In Aim 1, PI and his team will use genetic approaches to 1) delete the TGFβ1 gene in the liver of
mice (L-TGFβ1KO) with or without active Foxo1-S273D/D mutation, or 2) generate liver-specific
overexpression TGFβ1 mice (L-TGFβ1OE) with or without inactive Foxo1-S273A/A mutation, investigating
whether hepatic TGFβ1 is a key controller for Foxo1-pS273 in promoting HGP, apoptosis, liver fibrosis and
inflammation following the NASH diet feeding. Aim2 is to use mouse primary hepatocytes, bone marrow-
derived macrophages, and hepatic stellate cells (HSC) to determine the mechanisms by which TGFβ1
promotes macrophage depolarization and HSC activation via Foxo1-pS273 in hepatocytes. The specific-
domain interactions of Smad3 and Foxo1 and related target genes expression in hepatocytes will be further
investigated. Aim 3 is to investigate whether suppression of systematic or hepatic TGFβ1 signaling is
sufficient for the prevention of T2D and NASH in mice, in a Foxo1 dependent manner. Overall, using the
genetic, genomic, bioinformatic, and pharmacological approaches, the PI and his team are fully equipped to
investigate the new pathophysiological role of hepatic TGF-β1→Foxo1-pS273→TGFβ1 looping system in
control of T2D and NASH, which will provide novel insights on mechanism of diabetes and NASH."
10890158,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of this proposal is to unravel mechanisms driving abnormal immune activation and cognitive impairment
in people living with HIV (PLWH) through the lens of epigenetic programming. Despite overall advances in
lifespan and health for PLWH who are on suppressive ART, a subset of individuals on ART continue to
demonstrate neuroimmune abnormalities and associated clinical neurological syndromes including cognitive
complications. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies are a window into the CNS of PLWH, revealing a role for
abnormal myeloid cell activation and persistence viral replication in the CNS, despite apparent systemic viral
suppression with ART. Our own single cell genomic studies of fresh CSF cells from PLWH have shown that a
rare microglia-like myeloid cell population resides in the CSF in PLWH; that these cells are linked to HIV disease
status; and that these myeloid cells can harbor HIV DNA. Additionally, our research has shown that epigenetic
features of myeloid cells are rapidly altered in HIV infection and this aberrant myeloid epigenetic state associated
with HIV infection persists despite the immediate initiation of ART during acute HIV infection. However, despite
myeloid cells being recognized as crucial cellular mediators of CNS abnormalities in PLWH, the epigenetic
landscapes of CNS myeloid and other immune cells in PLWH remain uncharted. Our central hypothesis is
that HIV leaves epigenetic “scars” at regulatory regions of proinflammatory gene networks in distinct
CSF myeloid cell subsets, contributing to HIV-related cognitive impairment despite ART. This hypothesis
will be tested in our established HIV Associated Reservoirs and Comorbidities Study (HARC) cohort at Yale that
includes large volume lumbar puncture from study participants with and without HIV and will be further explored
utilizing postmortem brain specimens from the National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium (NNTC). In PLWH, we
will longitudinally assess fresh CSF myeloid and T cell single cell epigenetic and transcriptional cell states over
the course of ART treatment and ask whether there is damage to the epigenomes of CSF myeloid and T cells
sustained during HIV infection that persists over time as epigenetic “scars”. Using machine learning, we will then
assess for an association between epigenetic perturbations in PLWH and CNS outcomes, including cognitive
impairment and abnormal CSF soluble biomarkers of inflammation and neuronal injury. We will also explore
single cell epigenetic cell states of myeloid and glia in postmortem brain tissues from choroid plexus and
periventricular zones of HIV-infected individuals who died on suppressive ART and matched controls. Lastly, we
will apply an innovative new single cell assay for multifactorial chromatin profiling to assay histone modifications.
These proposed, in-depth, multiomic single cell analyses of distinct myeloid cell subsets in the CNS and blood,
combined with cognitive assessments, will reveal the effects of HIV infection on immune cell epigenomes, and
will uncover transcriptional and epigenetic states most strongly related to cognitive complications in PLWH. The
results will advance efforts to biotype CNS complications in PLWH based on immune and viral pathogenesis."

Black Americans bear a disproportionately greater burden of alcohol-related health problems when compared to
their White counterparts,1 representing a significant public health concern. Accordingly, eliminating health
disparities and achieving health equity is one of the leading goals of the NIH Healthy People Initiative.2 Although
existing research has made progress in understanding broad contributors to health inequities, existing models
of substance use fail to adequately explain disparities in alcohol-related consequences among Black adults.3
One promising approach to explaining these disparities is the examination of one’s neighborhood environment
and its relation to alcohol use and related consequences.4,5 Extant literature has linked specific neighborhood
characteristics (e.g., alcohol outlet and liquor store density6,7 and neighborhood disadvantage5) as important
contributors to alcohol use. Yet, existing research on the relationship between neighborhood context and
substance use among Black adults provides conflicting evidence on which neighborhood characteristics are
most important,8,9 highlighting the necessity of using novel approaches to identify salient factors within
individuals’ environments that may contribute to differential alcohol-related outcomes. Moreover, more research
is needed to identify mechanisms of action that associate environmental characteristics with alcohol outcomes,
and drinking motives are often theorized as a potential pathway. Adults living in different neighborhoods may
drink for different reasons, which may differentially influence their alcohol consumption and consequences
experienced. Thus, the current proposal seeks to use both qualitative and quantitative approaches to identify
neighborhood- and community-level factors that may influence alcohol outcomes among Black adults. Specific
aims include (1) identifying neighborhood characteristics (e.g., neighborhood disorganization and deprivation)
that serve as protective or risk factors for alcohol outcomes (i.e., alcohol consumption and alcohol-related
consequences) among Black adults and (2) investigating the association between neighborhood characteristics
and alcohol use outcomes and how alcohol motives may explain this relationship. Study findings will have
important implications for future health disparities research and are crucial for the development of effective,
mechanistically driven public health strategies, prevention and intervention efforts, and policy implications. The
applicant will gain training in (1) understanding the etiology of and treatment approaches for race-related
disparities for alcohol and substance use, (2) qualitative, quantitative, and analytical methodology, (3) scientific
writing and research dissemination, and (4) community-engaged and interdisciplinary approaches. Ultimately,
through the proposed research and training plan, the applicant will develop the skills and expertise necessary to
make a substantive contribution to the field of racial health disparities, aligning with the applicant’s strong desire
to become an independent clinical scientist addressing health inequities in the substance use field."

dendritic cells (cDC1s) cross-present exogenous, cell-associated antigens to CD8+ T cells, facilitated by the
colocalization of these two cell types in the T cell zone of secondary lymphoid tissues. This microanatomical
organization is orchestrated by CCR7 and XCR1, two G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) on cDC1s that
guide their migration towards gradients of chemoattractant ligand. Recent reports have established a crucial
role for tumor-associated cDC1s in cancer immunity. However, the GPCRs mediating cDC1 recruitment and
positioning at sites of inflammation and in tumors are incompletely understood.
 Preliminary work has revealed that GPR34, an understudied X-linked GPCR, is highly expressed by
cDC1s, and in vitro studies have shown that this lysophosphatidylserine (lysoPS)-responsive receptor supports
cell migration. Preliminary data presented herein indicate that GPR34 promotes the accumulation of cDC1s in
the inflamed mouse peritoneal cavity (PerC) in a cell-intrinsic manner. The PerC is a clinically important site for
colon and ovarian cancer metastasis. In a preliminary experiment inspired by the connection between cDC1
accumulation and cancer outcomes, GPR34-deficiency led to increased growth of a subcutaneous (SQ) tumor
model. This proposal will test the hypothesis that GPR34 regulates cDC1 organization and function
during inflammation and cancer. Aim 1 will mechanistically define how GPR34 controls the abundance,
trafficking, and positioning of PerC cDC1s using a combination of techniques including in vivo kinetic immune
phenotyping, in vitro migration assays, and immunofluorescence microscopy. Aim 2 will investigate the role of
GPR34 and lysoPS in cancer immunity using ectopic SQ and PerC tumor models along with tools to study
antigen-specific T cell responses and to manipulate ligand levels. Completion of these Aims will elucidate key
mechanisms by which GPR34 on cDC1s influences the response to inflammation and malignancy, providing
opportunities for the development of therapeutics that modulate the lysoPS-GPR34 chemoattractant system.
 These research goals will be conducted in conjunction with a comprehensive training plan to prepare
the applicant for an independent career as an academic physician-scientist. Training includes rigorous
mentorship in scientific skills from a highly qualified sponsor, Dr. Jason Cyster; technical education from
postdoctoral fellows in the applicant’s lab and collaborating labs; seminars, journal clubs, workshops, and
conferences; and clinically geared activities. Research and training will take place at the University of
California, San Francisco, which offers a highly innovative and collaborative immunology research environment
and an exceptional medical school for clinical training."

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a highly morbid disease with numerous causes but limited therapies. The avail-
able medications are only known to be safe and effective for patients with very specific forms of PH. Recently,
an inhaled medication, treprostinil, was approved for the treatment of PH related to interstitial lung disease (PH-
ILD). Most PH-ILD studies have either focused on patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or ILD as an all-
inclusive diagnosis. However, the various forms of ILD are distinct in their underlying pathophysiology and af-
fected patient populations. Connective tissue disease-related ILD (CTD-ILD) is an understudied form of ILD
which tends to affect young, ethnically diverse, female patients. The intersection of PH and CTD-ILD is particu-
larly challenging as the PH may arise through fibrosis-induced ablation of pulmonary blood vessels or from
endovascular dysfunction driven by the chronic inflammation of CTD. At this time, determining which mechanism
underlies an individual CTD-ILD patient’s PH is left to the discretion of clinicians who must also decide which
treatments to use based on their decision. These decisions are usually guided by subjective assessments of the
degree of fibrosis seen on chest imaging (e.g., computed tomography [CT]), the severity of restrictive ventilatory
defect measured during pulmonary function testing (PFT), and invasive hemodynamic measurements. In this
proposal, I will use a CT- and PFT-based severity staging system which was validated in patients with sclero-
derma ILD, to classify patients with CTD-ILD and PH as having either a parenchymal or vascular phenotype.
When I applied this system to 20 patients in the Johns Hopkins PH Center Registry, 35% of these patients were
reclassified and had received therapies discordant with their phenotype. To investigate the implications of these
preliminary findings, I will leverage the Johns Hopkins PH, ILD, and Myositis Centers’ registries to phenotype
patients with CTD-ILD-related PH (CTD-ILD-PH). My first aim is to determine the proportion of CTD-ILD-PH
patients with parenchymal and vascular phenotypes and compare disease severity between phenotypes
at the time of diagnosis. For this aim, I will compare various measures of disease severity collected at the time
of PH diagnosis for patients currently and prospectively enrolled in our registries. These measures will include
global and symptom-specific quality of life questionnaires, 6-minute walk distances, WHO functional class, and
hemodynamic assessments by echocardiography, serum NT-pro-BNP levels, and right heart catheterization.
Second, to compare the clinical outcomes of CTD-ILD-PH patients who receive phenotype-concordant
therapy with those who receive phenotype-discordant therapy, I will compare the clinical measures de-
scribed above before and after four to six months of PH therapy. Results from this study will provide data to
inform future studies of PH therapies for patients with the parenchymal and vascular phenotypes of CTD-ILD-
PH and serve as a strong foundation for a future K-level award."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most prevalent dementia, has no effective disease-modifying therapeutics. Our
recent studies have linked abnormalities in lysine methyltransferases G9a/GLP (also known as EHMT2/1) and
histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) to AD pathophysiology. We hypothesize that pharmacological
inhibition of G9a and GLP by small molecules can provide a novel and effective therapeutic strategy for the
treatment of AD. The objectives of this project are: (a) to demonstrate that newly-discovered G9a/GLP inhibitors
are efficacious in AD mouse models; (b) to optimize small-molecule inhibitors of G9a and GLP into a drug
candidate. To achieve these goals, we will pursue three specific aims. Aim 1, assess selectivity, cellular activity
and in vitro ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) and in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK)
properties of lead G9a/GLP inhibitors; Aim 2, evaluate in vivo effects of lead G9a/GLP inhibitors on
normalizing behavioral, synaptic, and transcriptional abnormalities in AD mouse models; Aim 3, Optimize
current G9a/GLP inhibitor leads into a drug candidate by designing, synthesizing and testing novel compounds
to simultaneously optimize potency, selectivity and PK properties. Completion of the proposed studies will not
only validate our therapeutic hypothesis, but also generate a drug candidate that could be ultimately translated
in the clinic for the treatment of AD. The improved G9a/GLP inhibitors generated in this project will also be
invaluable chemical tools for assessing the therapeutic potential of G9a/GLP inhibition in other diseases."
10754552,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Screening mammography saves lives but human interpretation alone is imperfect and is associated with
significant harms including ~30,000 missed breast cancers and ~3.8 million false-positives exams each year
in the U.S. alone. Traditional computer-aided detection failed to improve screening accuracy, in part due to
the static nature of software trained and tested on small datasets decades ago. Recent advances in improved
computer processing power, cloud-based data storage capabilities, and availability of large imaging datasets
have led to renewed excitement for applying artificial intelligence (AI) to mammography interpretation.
We propose a unique academic-industry partnership to validate, refine, scale, and clinically translate our
proven 2D mammography AI algorithm to 3D mammography interpretation. Our team helped organize and
lead the Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) Digital Mammography
Challenge, an open crowdsourced AI algorithmic challenge that provided >640,000 digital 2D mammogram
images and associated clinical metadata to >1,200 coding teams worldwide. Our industry partner for this
grant, DeepHealth, Inc., was the top performing team in the DREAM Challenge. With >50% of U.S. facilities
now offering 3D mammography for screening, the 50-to-100-fold increase in imaging data represents a new
critical barrier for both radiologists and AI algorithm developers. To date, there have been few publications
addressing AI-enhanced interpretation of 3D mammography, the emerging screening exam of choice.
We will validate our post-DREAM algorithm for 2D mammography (which currently rivals human interpretation
alone) using UCLA's Athena Breast Health Network, one of the largest population-based breast imaging
registries. We will enhance our 2D AI algorithm with expert radiologist supervision and examine the impact of
adding novel non-imaging data parameters, including genetic mutation and tumor molecular subtype data, to
help train the AI model to identify more clinically significant cancers. We will use several novel technical
algorithmic approaches to scale from 2D to 3D mammography which, in our preliminary studies, have shown
improved accuracy beyond radiologist interpretation alone. Finally, we will perform a series of interpretive
studies to identify the optimal interface between “black box” outputs and radiologist interpreters, which
remains an understudied topic. With >40 million U.S. women undergoing screening each year, seemingly
small improvements in overall accuracy would still imply significantly improved population-based outcomes.
In summary, we have assembled an unparalleled multidisciplinary team with expertise in machine/deep
learning, breast cancer screening accuracy, medicine, oncology, radiology, imaging technology assessment,
and biostatistics. We have a proven track record of strong collaboration and are well positioned to validate,
enhance, scale, and translate our proven 2D AI algorithm for improved 3D mammography accuracy. Our new
end user tool will help tip the balance of routine screening towards greater benefits than harms."
10951591,"ABSTRACT: One way to recover more lungs for the escalating numbers of patients requiring transplants is to
expand the donor pool via uncontrolled donation after circulatory death (uDCD), when organs are recovered
after death occurs unexpectedly inside or outside of hospitals. European countries use uDCD lungs routinely,
achieving outcomes similar to those from donation after brain death. In Europe, uDCD operates within opt-out
systems that allow rapid in situ lung preservation with cold perfusion via tubes inserted into the chests of the
recently deceased, a practice that would require prior authorization in the U.S. Our collaborators from Toronto
developed a novel uDCD protocol that preserves lungs non-invasively for just over 3 hours after death using
positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) and supplemental oxygen. In ~3 years, five patients received lungs
from uDCD donors, with four patients surviving beyond 100 days. Authorization for organ donation was required
before initiating lung preservation, leading to prolonged warm ischemic times (median 166 min) and discarding
64% of lungs assessed with ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP). Our empirical data suggest authorized persons might
accept having lung preservation initiated without explicit authorization when the procedures maintain body
integrity, which could dramatically reduce warm ischemic times and improve transplant yield after EVLP to >50%.
Before conducting a multicenter trial of our novel uDCD protocol, garnering approval from key stakeholders and
feasibility testing are essential. In Aim 1, we will refine the uDCD lung protocol using participatory action research
methods. We will present the uDCD protocol iteratively in meetings with key community and clinical stakeholders
for feedback. We will train readily available hospital staff (e.g., social workers, pulmonologists) to serve on
dedicated preservation of organ donation (POD) teams. Comprehensive timed simulations will occur with clinical
and organ recovery teams, beginning from initial presentation through lung recovery and transport to a
centralized facility for EVLP. Qualitative analysis of stakeholder meeting transcripts and detailed descriptions of
simulations will inform final protocol modifications and verify feasibility for lung recovery within 3 hours of
termination of resuscitation. In Aim 2, we will assess program safety by continuous review of outcomes from
each case activation and transplantation. We expect ~50% of lungs assessed with EVLP will be transplanted to
meet sustainability targets. Safety outcomes include primary graft dysfunction grade III at 72 hours and survival
tracked for 1 year. In Aim 3, we will test the ethical acceptability of requesting uDCD authorization from decision-
makers. An ethics panel, convened via teleconferencing, will review case notes of conversations with decision-
makers who were approached; through shared mediation, panel members will determine appropriateness (Yes,
No) with expected rates >90%. Results will be corroborated with qualitative interviews of participants who were
approached for uDCD lung preservation 2 weeks after the request. This research meets NHLBI's goal to
identify barriers and facilitators to lung procurement via DCD."
10752624,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 Breast cancer (BC) is the most prevalent cancer and the second-leading cause of cancer-related death for
women in the USA. For moderate-risk and, especially, low-risk women with a 1-in-8 lifelong chance of developing
BC, there are very few options available to reduce their risk. For high-risk women, prophylactic mastectomy is
currently the most effective procedure for preventing BC. This aggressive surgical procedure affects women
physically, emotionally, psychologically, aesthetically, and socially. Therefore, there is a need to develop new
strategies for primary prevention that focus on high-risk women, but that could also be applied to moderate- and
low-risk women. Our overall hypothesis is that the local killing of mammary epithelial cells will be as effective as
prophylactic mastectomy in preventing BC, but with minimal side effects. Our preliminary and published data
demonstrate that intraductal (ID) injection of a 70% ethanol (EtOH) solution is effective at locally ablating
mammary epithelial cells in rodent models and at preventing tumor formation in an aggressive mouse model of
BC. The scientific rigor of prior preclinical and clinical research studies as well as clinical use of ID procedures
strongly support the translational feasibility of our approach. We have developed a refined EtOH-based solution
that contains: tantalum oxide (TaOx) nanoparticles as a high-resolution contrast agent to monitor in vivo filling of
ductal trees by CT/X-ray imaging; and ethyl cellulose as gelling agent to further minimize collateral tissue
damage. The research objectives of this study are: a) to optimize methods for achieving and in vivo visualizing
maximal epithelial ablation; b) to determine the protective benefit and safety concerns of incomplete epithelial
ablation; c) to understand the interactions of the components of the ablative solution with the tissue (e.g., fibrosis)
and their potential interference with imaging findings (e.g., contrast clearance); and d) To apply this knowledge
to establish a clinically compatible procedure for image-guided ablative therapy. To accomplish these, we
propose the following two specific aims: Aim 1) To evaluate therapeutic efficacy and safety profile of the ID
ablative procedure in rat models of breast cancer; Aim 2) To assess scalability of this image-guided ID ablative
procedure in the multi-ductal tree system of a rabbit model. Given the clinical uses of EtOH, diagnostic ID
procedures, and clinically compatible imaging protocols, positive results of this study could rapidly lead to the
evaluation of image-guided EtOH-based ablation procedure in first-in-human clinical trials for high-risk women.
If successful in a high-risk setting, this ID procedure could be offered to moderate- and low-risk women who want
to decrease their chance of developing BC and the cancer-associated anxiety that affects their quality of life."
10752625,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Acute asthma exacerbations are the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in children with asthma.
Current treatment for acute asthma exacerbations in the pediatric Emergency Department (ED) follows an one-
size-fits all approach including inhaled bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids. However, treatment
response to initial protocolized therapies is variable and unpredictable presenting a significant management
challenge for ED clinicians. Unfortunately, the pathobiologic mechanisms driving treatment response remain
unclear, and an effective method to predict treatment response does not exist. Thus, ED clinicians frequently
struggle with treatment and disposition decisions leading to over-utilization of therapies, prolonged ED length
of stay, and hospitalizations in responders, and delays in appropriate therapy for non-responders. The
extensive variation and inefficiency in care highlights the critical need for tools to inform more precise and
effective ED management strategies for acute asthma exacerbations. The nasal transcriptome and airway
oscillometry (AOS) are novel biologic and physiologic markers with strong potential to address this unmet
knowledge and practice gap. This proposal aims to apply an innovative biomarker-directed, individualized
approach to ED asthma management by leveraging these novel markers to pursue the following specific aims:
1) determine the utility of AOS as an objective measure of ED treatment responsiveness; 2) identify airway
endotypes of ED treatment responsiveness using nasal transcriptomics, and 3) derive and internally validate a
clinical prediction rule incorporating biologic and physiologic markers to determine ED treatment
responsiveness in children with acute asthma exacerbations. To achieve these aims, the candidate, Nidhya
Navanandan, MD, will leverage an existing study infrastructure for enrolling children with acute asthma
exacerbations in the ED, developed in conjunction with her mentors during her institutional career development
award. As a pediatric emergency medicine physician, Dr. Navanandan is uniquely positioned to accomplish the
proposed K23 research and training aims. Her long-term goal is to become an expert in clinical and
translational research methods to improve the effectiveness of emergency care for pediatric asthma. Dr.
Navanandan has developed a detailed career development plan consisting of mentorship, didactic coursework,
and hands-on laboratory and research conduct experience in order to expand her knowledge and skills in
leadership of prospective studies, discovery and application of novel markers for clinical practice, and
predictive analytics. Dr. Navanandan has assembled a multidisciplinary team of mentors with extensive clinical
and translational research experience and topical expertise in the above realms to ensure her success in
achieving the stated specific aims and career goals. This proposal will allow Dr. Navanandan to transition to an
independent physician-scientist and prepare her for future R01-funding."
10752626,"SUMMARY African Americans develop kidney failure at rates 4-5 fold higher than European
Americans. Coding variants in the APOL1 gene, found only in people of recent African ancestry, drive a
large fraction of this risk disparity. We have named these APOL1 variants G1 (S342G and I384M) and
G2 (del388N389Y). Risk inheritance is recessive: only individuals carrying two variant APOL1 alleles
have a markedly increased risk of kidney disease. In the U.S. approximately 13% of African Americans,
or about 4,000,000 people, have a high-risk genotype. Most recessive diseases are caused by loss-of-
function mutation. Surprisingly, there is data from model systems in kidney cells, mice, drosophila, and
yeast that support the idea that the APOL1 risk variants (RV) are actually gain-of-function mutations
that cause toxicity when expressed at high levels. The overarching goal of this proposal is to
understand the mechanism of APOL1 kidney disease such that two RVs are required, providing insight
into this fundamental question of recessive, gain-of-function toxicity. We propose that the G0, or wild-
type, APOL1 allele can alter the behavior of the risk variants and thus prevent their toxicity. In AIM 1,
we will use isogenic, Crispr-engineered APOL1 BAC transgenic mice to determine the differing
properties of G0 and risk-variant APOL1 in the full complexity of the glomerulus. We will test the effects
of different APOL1 variants singly and in combination in order to answer questions about gene dosage,
WT rescue of risk-variant toxicity, and possible differences in mechanism of action between the two
major APOL1 risk alleles (G1 and G2). In AIM 2, our goal is to understand APOL1 targeting to lipid
droplets. We have observed that lipid droplets (LDs) show prominent G0 but little or no G1 or G2
localization in cell systems and that co-expression of G0 facilitates the movement of G1 or G2 onto lipid
droplets. We will use imaging and biochemical analyses to examine determinates of APOL1 localization
to LDs, determine if there are differences in the binding of APOL1 to other LD-associated proteins, and
define the cellular consequence(s) of altered APOL1 risk variant targeting to the LD. We will test the
relevance of these experiments with in vivo studies. In AIM 3, we will determine the role of aggregation
in APOL1-mediated cytotoxicity. We have observed that the APOL1 RVs have much stronger
propensity than G0 to aggregate. Our data indicate that RV aggregation occurs in mitochondria. We
hypothesize that aggregation is a key element in RV toxicity, and that G0 can interfere with RV
aggregation. In cell-based systems we will characterize the APOL1 aggregates, determine whether
aggregation is essential for APOL1-mediated cytotoxicity, understand the effect of aggregates on
mitochondrial function, and test whether G0 can reverse RV aggregation and cytotoxicity. In vitro
results will be validated in kidney organoids, a mouse model, and in human tissues."
10947543,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of this training proposal is to employ quantitative imaging to noninvasively characterize tumor
microenvironmental heterogeneity in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) for the prediction of treatment
response and outcome. TNBC is an aggressive breast cancer subtype with notable diversity in disease biology
and clinical presentation. Recently-approved immunotherapies introduce exciting new avenues for neoadjuvant
treatment of TNBC; however, response to immunotherapy is variable and treatment can entail significant adverse
effects and financial cost. Variable response to therapy can be attributed in-part to heterogeneity of the tumor
microenvironment, affecting therapeutic delivery and efficacy. Through an innovative approach known as “habitat
imaging”, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) can be used to spatially resolve local
microenvironments within a lesion into distinct tumor subregions, or habitats. For the research component of this
proposal, we propose to use quantitative breast imaging and informatics techniques to identify tumor habitats
and whole-lesion habitat signatures for TNBC patient stratification. We hypothesize that imaging-derived habitat
signatures identified prior to treatment can aid in stratifying TNBC patients with increased probability of achieving
pCR and/or decreased risk of recurrence. We will test this hypothesis through the following specific aims: Aim 1
(K99) To retrospectively identify tumor habitat signatures from pretreatment mpMRI to stratify TNBC patients
and predict treatment outcome; Aim 2 (R00) To prospectively employ habitat imaging using hybrid positron
emission tomography (PET)/MRI for improved TNBC patient stratification. Successful completion of my research
aims will provide a clinically-translatable methodology for improved understanding of an individual’s lesion
physiology that could guide personalized treatment strategies for optimal patient outcome. To provide me with
the necessary training to successfully carry out these research aims, this proposal outlines a mentored-training
plan with three areas of focus: 1) strengthen my expertise in clinical breast cancer research, 2) receive additional
training in computational pathology, and 3) obtain educational training and hands-on experience with PET/MRI
to prepare for research in the independent R00 phase and beyond. This training program will be executed under
the direct mentorship of NIH-funded researchers and clinicians specializing in medical oncology, nuclear
medicine, pathology and radiology, and take place within the well-equipped and established cancer research
environment at the University of Washington and Fred Hutch Cancer Center. As outlined in my career
development plan, funding from this proposal will be used to dedicate time for educational workshops and training
seminars, along with regular meetings with my mentorship team. Together, this training and research proposal
will ensure that I am well-prepared to achieve my career goal to become an independent investigator focused
on the translation of innovative imaging techniques to clinical practice to further personalize breast cancer care."
10935965,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lipids are an essential component of neuronal function and structure. Genetic mutations associated with
disturbed lipid metabolism in neurodegenerative disorders is becoming increasingly recognized, yet the
mechanisms that regulate neuronal lipid metabolism is poorly understood. We and others have found SNX14, a
sorting-nexin (SNX) protein associated with a spinocerebellar ataxia (SCAR20), to be a regulator of endoplasmic
reticulum (ER)-lipid droplet (LD) biogenesis, fatty acid desaturation, and cerebellar lipid homeostasis. I have
discovered that SNX14 interacts with its paralog, SNX13, in neural cells. SNX13 is also an ER resident protein
that controls triglyceride content, LD numbers, and lysosomal cholesterol homeostasis. We recently identified
homozygous SNX13 variants in three children with a novel cerebellar ataxia similar to SCAR20. However, little
is known regarding the basic molecular mechanisms behind SNX13 function in neurons, and how depletion of
Snx13 leads to degeneration. My overarching hypothesis is that SNX13 functions in neuronal lipid homeostasis,
which is critical for cerebellar function and survival. To test this hypothesis, Aim 1 will knock down Snx13 by
AAV-mediated in vivo delivery of Snx13 sgRNAs to dCAS9-KRAB expressing mice to investigate the role of
Snx13 in cerebellar integrity and motor behavior. Aim 2 will leverage genome edited human pluripotent stem cell
derived neuronal cultures to define the impact of SNX13 patient mutations on LD homeostasis under conditions
of cellular stress (e.g., excess fatty acids and excitotoxicity). Successful completion of these aims will be an
important foundation for future studies investigating neuronal LD homeostasis, while simultaneously providing
me with outstanding training in CRISPR/Cas9 methodologies, stem cell biology, and behavior. Further, these
efforts will uncover basic disease mechanisms that can be used to inform targeted therapeutic strategies for
patients with SNX13 or SNX14 mutations, including other relevant neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders.
The proposed training plan is sponsored by Dr. Naiara Akizu and Dr. Beverly Davidson at the University of
Pennsylvania and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. This proposal provides a phenomenal training experience
that will expand my technical expertise in cellular neurobiology, and cultivate my professional skills in science
communication, mentoring, and leadership, all of which will facilitate my career goals of becoming a leading
researcher in the field of neurodegeneration."
10897782,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mental disorders affect one in four people worldwide (~2 billion people), with the cost of mental health conditions
projected to reach $6 trillion by 2030. Unfortunately, mental disorders are difficult to diagnose, monitor, and treat.
Repeated triggering of daily stress can also lead to chronic stress, associated with higher risks of mental
disorders, weakening immuneresponse, and cardiovascular diseases. Despite the mental health crisis, available
resources and access to care scarcely begin to meet the need. Moreover, there are no objective tests or scalable
technologies for detecting chronic stress. To advance precision mental healthcare, we need continuous,
predictive, and quantitative measurements of mental states for stress, anxiety, and depression. Wearable
devices can transform mental health care due to their ability to monitor previously inaccessible biodata. However,
there are limited wearable devices designed for mental health monitoring. In the proposed research, I will tackle
the mentioned problems in mental health monitoring by developing platform technologies based on skin-like
wearable biosensors. The focus of the proposed study is to create a soft and wearable biosensor that can
measure multiple mental health biomarkers wirelessly in real-time, providing quantifiable metrics to assist
diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, and prevention of mental disorders. Two new technologies will be developed:
a soft and wireless patch to measure mental health-related physical biomarkers on the skin and a new organic
biosensor platform to monitor chemical biomarkers in sweat. First, I will design a soft and wireless sensor patch
to monitor skin conductance changes in response to acute stressors and circadian rhythm. The designed skin
conductance sensor patch, composed of intrinsically stretchable and soft materials, will provide seamless
integration with skin and accurate measurement with high signal-to-noise ratios. Second, I will fabricate a soft
chemical biosensor to monitor the stress hormone in sweat using organic field-effect transistors. A highly
sensitive and selective aptamer chemical biosensor will be utilized in a skin-like organic material system. Both
alone and combined, the skin-like wearable systems will allow continuous quantitative monitoring of mental
health biomarkers, assisting in the prevention and treatment of mental disorders. Professor Zhenan Bao,
Professor Leanne Williams, and Stanford University provide the tools and expertise needed to accomplish the
proposed research. Working with Professor Bao, a leading scientist in the field of intrinsically stretchable
materials, I will acquire scientific skills in the design, fabrication, and characterization techniques of organic
materials and bioelectronics. In addition, I will gain experience working with human subjects during this
postdoctoral training. For this reason, I am working with Professor Williams, my co-mentor, who is a leading
professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences. Moreover, I will obtain training in psychiatry and electrical
engineering by taking classes at Stanford. This environment provides the expertise needed to accomplish the
proposed research and provide me with the appropriate training to pursue a career in academic research."

 The deleterious health impacts of disasters exacerbate pre-existing vulnerabilities and inequities,1 and
disproportionately affect racial and ethnic minorities and the poor.2,3 However, the evidence base guiding our
nation’s preparedness and response has been described as “seriously deficient.”4 Research conducted in the
aftermath of a disaster is essential to building this evidence base, but is inherently challenging.5–7 Accordingly,
an established and trained disaster research workforce is essential.4 However, we are unaware of any training
that provides researchers hands-on, experiential training in environmental and public health disaster research
methods, nor any with a specific focus on supporting underrepresented minority scholars in this domain. In
response, the Increasing Diversity in and Equitable Access to Applied Learning in Disaster Research
Response: IDEAAL DR2 program will provide intensive skills-based training in environmental and public
health disaster research. We will partner with the Bill Anderson Fund (BAF), the only nonprofit organization
that focuses explicitly on supporting underrepresented minority (URM) scholars in hazards and disaster
research, to design an inclusive recruitment process and training program. IDEAAL DR2 will train up to 100
early career researchers across the U.S., with an intentional focus on URM scholars, to 1) Increase the
knowledge and awareness of environmental and public health disaster research methods and skills among
interdisciplinary, early career researchers who are interested in conducting public health-focused hazards and
disaster research; and 2) Increase diversity, equity, and inclusion in hazards and disaster research by
providing access to the necessary training, equipment, technology, and advising to support early-career
researchers from historically underrepresented backgrounds in the development and completion of their own
research projects. The course will include five modules with pre-course, in-person, and post-course
components: 1) foundations of disaster research; 2) community engagement in disaster research, 3) disaster
research methods; 4) tools and instrumentation for disaster research; and 5) disaster research design and
implementation. For 12 months following the in-person course, Fellows will design and implement an
independent disaster research project, leading to a paper of publishable quality, supported by monthly training
workshops and peer accountability groups. To circumvent economic and institutional barriers that perpetuate
systemic inequities, five URM Fellows annually, recruited in partnership with the BAF, will receive dedicated
research advising and financial support for their project. Interdisciplinary program faculty have a strong and
long-standing history of collaboration. They will be guided by an advisory committee and results from a
rigorous formative and summative evaluation program. Course and evaluation materials will be disseminated
broadly through the NIEHS DR2 and NIEHS Partnerships for Environmental Public Health Resources Portal,
and evaluation findings will be shared with NIEHS and through conference presentations and publications."
10746428,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Transfer ribonucleic acids (tRNAs) are required for the synthesis of proteins within cells. tRNAs
are found to contain the highest density and greatest diversity of post-transcriptionally modified
nucleosides of any class of RNAs. Our scientific understanding of the functional role of these
modified nucleosides in tRNAs is limited in large part by the lack of methods that can routinely
identify and map modifications onto a primary tRNA sequence. The long-term goal of this research
continues to be to develop appropriate mass spectrometric approaches that enable biological
studies into the functional significance of modified tRNAs. This renewal is focused on the specific
goal of identifying and understanding modified tRNAs from human samples. This research is
timely and relevant as less than 15% of the nearly 270 predicted unique human tRNA sequences
have been characterized at this level of detail. Moreover, a number of recent studies have
implicated tRNAs and their modifications in a variety of different human diseases and pathologies.
Our knowledge of the complete modification profiles of human tRNAs has been limited by the lack
of bioanalytical methods capable of identifying specific modified ribonucleosides and particular
sequence locations within individual tRNAs. Based on our advances in the last support period,
the three specific aims in this renewal address the short-comings in the field by establishing a
workflow that will define the population of tRNAs expressed in the sample, the census of modified
nucleosides present, and the mapping of those modified nucleosides onto the specific expressed
tRNAs. Our innovations will lead to the creation of tRNA region-specific modification profiling
assays that can be used to track dynamic changes in these modifications across multiple sample
types. We will demonstrate the utility and significance of our approach by examining changes in
these profiles using melanocytes and various melanomas.
This research plan will have significant impacts on multiple fields and disciplines. When complete,
we will have an approach that can document the qualitative and quantitative differences of
modified tRNA expressed in tissue, cell lines or disease condition. Our advances will provide the
ability to develop insights into the role of tRNA modification status in protein synthesis regulation,
proteostasis imbalances or disease state maintenance. Moreover, the bioanalytical developments
to result from this research can be applied to scientific investigations that seek to understand how
the cell regulates RNA modification patterns as well as how variable RNA modification patterns
affect other cellular regulatory processes."
10997315,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
PARP16, a member of the PARP family of enzymes responsible for carrying out the post-translational
modification known as ADP-ribosylating, is emerging as a novel therapeutic target in two cancer subtypes. In
ovarian cancer, PARP16 was shown to negatively regulate protein translation in order to maintain proteostasis.
Genetic deletion (i.e., knockout or knockdown) of PARP16 resulted in an increase in global protein translation,
forcing ovarian cancer cells to enter a state of proteotoxic stress that ultimately leads to cancer cell death. In
small cell lung cancer (SCLC), PARP16 was identified as an off-target to the recently FDA-approved PARP1
inhibitor, talazoparib, suggesting that the efficacy of talazoparib in SCLC may be due to dual targeting of
PARP1 and PARP16. However, knockdown of PARP16 alone also decreased SCLC viability. Both of these
cancer studies point to PARP16 as actionable oncology target, however, the role of PARP16 catalytic activity
in cancer has not been fully characterized. Our group has recently developed the first cysteine-targeted
covalent PARP inhibitor called DB008, that displays excellent proteome-wide selectivity for PARP16 in the
covalent binding mode. While DB008 inhibits PARP16 catalytic activity with nanomolar potency, neither of the
aforementioned PARP16 knockout/knockdown phenotypes were observed with DB008 treatment in ovarian
cancer and SCLC, suggesting that the non-catalytic activity (i.e., protein-protein interactions) of
PARP16 may regulate protein homeostasis and cancer growth as opposed to PARP16 enzymatic
activity. To test this hypothesis, I aim to develop two novel chemical probes, based on DB008, to evaluate the
non-catalytic functions of PARP16 in cancer. In Aim 1, I will synthesize a PARP16 proteolysis targeting
chimera (PROTAC) that will chemically knockdown PARP16 in ovarian cancer and SCLC. The PARP16
PROTAC will evaluate whether depletion of PARP16 and its protein-protein interactions reduces cancer cell
viability as observed with genetic knockdown methods. Completion of this aim will validate PARP16 as a new
cancer target and provide a lead preclinical drug candidate. In Aim 2, I introduce a novel proximity labeling
strategy for identifying interactors of endogenous PARP16 in cancer. This is done by converting DB008 into a
caged photo-crosslinkable probe that uses UV light to uncage and release a reactive crosslinking species that
will covalently tag interacting proteins, which can then be enriched using click chemistry and identified by mass
spectrometry. Completion of this aim will provide understanding for how PARP16 regulates translation and cell
viability in cancer. The technology described in Aim 2 presents a new use case for covalent inhibitors that is
generalizable to other enzymes families beyond PARPs. In summary, this proposal will generate invaluable
chemical biology tools for uncovering the mechanism of action of PARP16 in cancer while also providing a
potential lead drug candidate for combating PARP16-mediated diseases."

Streptococcal bacteria contribute to infections of vital organs through their surface proteins which facilitate their
adherence, colonization, and biofilm formation. In the oral cavity, S. mutans use its surface adhesins AgI/II and
GbpC to adhere to Gp340 for initial adherence, dextran to promote biofilm development, and in some cases
other microbes which are incorporated into biofilms. More generally many members of the streptococcal species
express an AgI/II-like homolog which they use to adhere to both shared and species-specific targets, implicating
them in contributing to the disease state of infections involving these streptococci. At sites of physical damage
to gums or gum disease, streptococcal species can infiltrate the blood stream and become systemic opportunistic
pathogens.
This proposal focuses on characterizing the molecular mechanisms of host-microbe and microbe-microbe
interactions involving the AgI/II-family of proteins. In structural studies of SspB the Deivanayagam lab discovered
a peptide-binding cleft within the V-region, a shared cleft housing a calcium ion. This peptide has nanomolar
adherence with the V-regions of SspB, AgI/II and GbpC; the peptide inhibits the V-regions adherence to SRCR
region of Gp340 and reduces biofilm formation. In studies with GbpC, this cleft was shown to also be involved in
the V-regions adherence to dextran. Our preliminary studies have shown not only shared adherence targets, but
also conserved areas of adherence.
Both the apical V-region and cell-wall anchored C-terminal regions of AgI/II-family proteins have been shown to
be involved in adherence host surfaces. In this proposal we plan to investigate the hypothesis that the
Extracellular matrix (ECM) protein interactions among AgI/II-family proteins would share similar but distinct motifs
that contribute to the initiation or progression of infections outside the oral cavity. The specific aims are Aim1:
Characterize the interactions between AgI/II-family proteins and ECMs. Aim 2: Determine AgI/II proteins’ ability
to interact with other pathogenic microorganisms. The proposed studies will elucidate shared areas of adherence
to determine the potential for designing inhibitors to prevent the interaction which would reduce the ability of
these streptococci to contribute to infection and disease."
10749229,"Background. Firearm injury accounts for 70% of Veteran suicides, making safer storage of firearms among
Veterans at risk for suicide a top VA & HSR&D priority. Although VA providers encourage Veterans to store
their firearms more safely during lethal means safety counseling (LMSC), only about half of individuals follow
through on these recommendations. Additionally, little is known about methods for verifying firearm storage
practices, which are critical for evaluating LMSC interventions. Research shows that offering financial and
social incentives increases behavior change, and the Philadelphia VAMC has led a successful national
program providing incentive-based interventions to Veterans with substance use disorders. The use of financial
and social incentives to increase safe storage of firearms, however, has not yet been assessed.
Significance/Impact. This proposal aims to leverage financial and social incentives to increase Veterans’ safe
storage of firearms following LMSC, thereby contributing to VA’s suicide prevention efforts. VA’s existing
infrastructure supporting the delivery of both LMSC and incentive-based interventions makes it an ideal setting
for this work. Operational partners, including the Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, the Rocky
Mountain VA, and the Veterans Rural Health Resource Center support this proposal.
Innovation. Financial and social incentives increase behavior change and our pilot work suggests that
Veterans and VA clinicians are interested in using incentives to encourage safer storage of firearms. This
proposal is the first to examine the use of incentives to change firearm storage behavior. It is also the first to
evaluate methods for verifying firearm storage practices, which will provide critical information to researchers
developing lethal means safety interventions and clinical providers delivering these interventions.
Specific Aims. 1) Consult with stakeholders to determine the most acceptable and feasible intervention
protocol that offers Veterans at risk for suicide financial and/or social incentives to store their firearms safely. 2)
Pilot test the add-on, incentive-based intervention among Veterans receiving LMSC in VA behavioral health.
Methodology. Aims will include participants from the VAMCs in Philadelphia and New Orleans, and will be
conducted remotely to facilitate recruitment. Veteran participants will be seen in outpatient behavioral health
and have access to firearms; equal numbers will be drawn from urban and rural settings and about a quarter
will identify as women and racial/ethnic minorities. Aim 1 will include two steps. First, we will conduct qualitative
interviews with ~20 Veterans with recent suicidal ideation, as well as ~10 VA clinicians/administrators.
Interviews will evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of potential incentives, methods of verifying firearm
storage practices, and other intervention components. Second, we will develop an advisory board made up of
8 Veterans and 8 other stakeholders (subject matter experts, VA clinicians/administrators). The advisory board
will consider findings from qualitative interviews and use online modified Delphi methods to reach consensus
on the most acceptable intervention components and best items to include in the pilot trial outcome measures.
The study team will develop an intervention protocol and iteratively modify it to align with study findings. In Aim
2, we will conduct a pilot study with 24 Veterans who have completed LMSC to assess the add-on, incentive-
based intervention. We will evaluate the feasibility of recruitment, retainment, provision of incentives, and
methods of verifying changes in firearm storage, the acceptability of the intervention, and methods of
individualizing the intervention based on Veterans’ preferences and sociodemographic characteristics.
Next Steps/Implementation. We will apply for IIR funding to conduct a multi-site, Hybrid Effectiveness-
Implementation Type 1 Randomized Clinical Trial. This trial will assess the effectiveness of the add-on LMSC
intervention and barriers and facilitators to its implementation. If effective, we will disseminate the intervention
in VA behavioral health settings to improve safe storage of firearms among Veterans at risk for suicide."

Before a newly budded HIV-1 particle becomes fusogenic (and infective) it must undergo
maturation. During maturation the contents of the virion transform from a spherical shell into a
conical structure after a series of cleavages of the 55 kDa Gag polyprotein by the viral protease.
Proteolytic processing starts at the site between the spacer peptide 1 (SP1) and the
nucleocapsid (NC) and culminates in the separation of SP1 from the capsid protein (CA). The
initial cleavage event effectively separates the NC-gRNA layer from the viral membrane
inducing gRNA condensation. The last event activates a molecular switch that triggers a late
maturation event, namely the assembly of the mature HIV-1 capsid around the ribonucleic
protein. During maturation, the matrix protein (MA), that is embedded to the viral membrane via
a myristoyl group, is cleaved from CA, resulting in reordering of the MA lattice and alteration of
the composition of the lipid membrane. Although several structures of immature and mature CA
and MA hexamers have been solved by sub tomogram averaging, the molecular mechanism
connecting the multiple events that occur during HIV-1 maturation are still unclear. Here, we
propose to utilize full-scale molecular dynamics simulations, integrating shaped-based coarse-
grained and atomistic methods, to determine motion-structures that reveal the mechanistic
details of HIV-1 virion maturation. Results from the simulations will inform the engineering of
protein mutants for structural analysis and guide the experimental design of functional analyses
and testing of hypotheses derived from the molecular simulations."
10747967,"The synergy between Streptococcus pneumoniae and influenza during co-infection has long been
recognized. Our data indicate that this synergy is operative on a physical level, as we provide evidence of
influenza A virus (IAV) binding to the surface of S. pneumoniae, providing fitness benefits to both
pathogens. We have strong experimental evidence that IAV directly binds to S. pneumoniae, facilitating
enhanced bacterial adhesion in vitro and enhanced colonization and dissemination in vivo. This intimate
interaction between virus and the bacterial surface is not limited to S. pneumoniae, as binding was
observed with multiple bacterial inhabitants of the human respiratory tract including species of
Staphylococcus, Moraxella, and Haemophilus. The relationship between IAV and the bacterial surface is
mutually beneficial, as IAV bound to specific bacterial species demonstrate dramatically enhanced
environmental stability, with IAV retaining infectivity during desiccation only when in complex with bacteria.
Our long-term goal is to gain a greater understanding of the synergies operative during IAV-bacterial co-
infections during both invasive disease and transmission. The overall objective of this proposal is to gain a
mechanistic understanding of how direct IAV-pneumococcal binding occurs and the impact of these
interactions on host-pathogen interactions. We hypothesize that the direct interactions between IAV and
bacteria are mediated by specific factors of both pathogens and that the direct interactions between
bacteria and IAV impact respiratory infection. The interkingdom interplay between respiratory pathogens
may be underappreciated as a mechanism underlying viral–bacterial synergy during respiratory infection."

Arm and hand movements are essential for daily-life functions and are largely impaired in veterans with cervical
spinal cord injury (SCI). Promising results have been reported on the effects of transcutaneous electrical spinal
stimulation (TESS) on arm and hand functional recovery, however, the effects remain limited and this method
has not yet entered clinical practice. Our specific goals are to: 1) examine physiological effects of TESS on
upper-limb muscles after cervical SCI, and 2) maximize the recovery of arm and hand function by using tailored
TESS in a task-specific manner combined with motor training. We focus on reaching and grasping movements
because of their importance in daily life activities. Thus, our results may have a direct impact on the quality of
life of veterans and their caregivers by enhancing their independence and level of care.
[In Aim 1, we will investigate the effects of TESS on cortical and subcortical neuronal pathways including the
reticulospinal pathway, intracortical inhibition in the primary motor cortex, and in their interaction. Transcranial
magnetic stimulation (TMS) will be used to examine transmission in intracortical pathways within the primary
motor cortex and a loud acoustic stimuli will be used to engage reticulospinal inputs. In Aim 2, we propose to
maximize the effects of TESS on recovery of arm and hand function by applying TESS in a task-specific manner
during the reaching or the grasping phases of movements followed up by massed practice training. TESS will
be applied using a novel closed-loop paradigm that relies on ongoing kinematic signals to trigger stimulation in
a task-dependent manner in Veterans with chronic cervical SCI.] Training activities will focus on intrinsic and
extrinsic muscles of the hand and arm movements using the virtual reality RAPAEL Smart Glove. These unique
approaches aiming at promoting neuroplasticity during functionally relevant movements using targeted task-
specific TESS have not been used before.
The proposed experiments will provide new knowledge on the control of upper-limb functions, which will be used
to guide functionally-relevant plasticity-inducing protocols to enhance recovery of hand and arm function. The
absence of well-accepted treatments for upper-limb motor impairments for veterans with cervical SCI and the
limited behavioral gains of present interventions underline the importance of these investigations."

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is characterized by the development of fluid-filled sacs
called cysts in both kidneys, but key signals that cause cyst formation are unknown. Multiple downstream cellular
pathways are dysregulated during cystogenesis. However, targeting these pathways has limited effects on
ADPKD treatment. ADPKD is caused by mutations in genes encoding for polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2
(PC2). Both polycystins localize to primary cilia. The primary cilium instructs cellular decisions in response to
extracellular inputs by compartmentalizing subcellular signaling. However, the role of primary cilium in kidney
cystogenesis is inherently complex. Loss of polycystins causes severe cystogenesis, which is mostly cilia-
dependent, while loss of cilia by itself causes smaller cysts. These results suggest that a complex interplay
between counter-regulatory positive and negative signals in cilia inhibit cyst formation in normal renal tubules
and promote cyst growth in ADPKD, respectively. Identifying these signals could have profound impacts on novel
therapeutic targets and strategies for ADPKD. However, uncoupling ciliary signals causing cystogenesis from
downstream signaling pathways affected during cystogenesis and the difficulty in identification of ciliary signals
in absence of cilia have prevented their identification. Here, by studying the ciliary trafficking adapter, tubby
family protein Tulp3, we aim to identify and target the key upstream ciliary signals that regulate cystogenesis.
We previously showed that Tulp3 functions in ciliary trafficking of membrane proteins without affecting respective
protein levels or disrupting cilia by coupling to the intraflagellar transport complex A (IFT-A). We recently showed
that embryonic kidney-specific conditional knockouts of Tulp3 developed renal cystogenesis that was less severe
than from polycystin loss. Concomitant Tulp3 loss did not inhibit cystogenesis upon PC1 loss, unlike ciliary
disruption, but caused early lethality, suggesting accelerated loss of renal function. These results further
reinforce the polycystin independent inhibitory role of ciliary proteins in cystogenesis. Other groups have reported
suppression of cystogenesis in adult mouse models of PKD from Tulp3 or IFT-A loss. Thus, we hypothesize that
Tulp3-regulated ciliary cargoes determine cilia-dependent cyst inhibition during development and PC1/2-
inhibited cilia-dependent cyst activation in adults. Here by leveraging our expertise in ciliary trafficking and
signaling and using novel mouse models to block trafficking of potential cargo subtypes, we propose to identify
ciliary regulators of cystogenesis. In Aim 1, we will determine novel Tulp3 trafficked ciliary cargoes and signaling
outputs in cilia relevant to cystogenesis. In Aim 2, we will determine Tulp3 regulated cyst inhibitory ciliary cargo
subtypes that genetically synergize with PC1 during murine kidney development. In Aim 3, we will test Tulp3
cargo subtypes as promoters of cystogenesis in adult mouse models of PKD in vivo using genetic epistasis. Our
approach will determine dual ciliary drivers impacting cystogenesis in vivo during adult-onset ADPKD and
embryonic-onset cystic disease unraveling the molecular nature of cilium-generated signaling in either setting."
10749011,"Leigh syndrome (LS) is a mitochondrial disease that causes irreversible developmental regression in children.
Currently, no treatment options are available, and most children do not live to see their second birthday. LS is
biochemically characterized by defective mitochondrial bioenergetics due to a variety of possibly mutated
mitochondrial proteins, which can be encoded in both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. Here, we will focus on
two LS proteins: leucine rich pentacotripeptide repeat motif containing protein (LRPPRC), and transactivator of
COXI (TACO1). Loss of LRPPRC decreases stability of all mRNAs, and also leads to loss of mRNA
polyadenylation and the appearance of aberrant mitochondrial translation. Loss of TACO1 specifically prevents
translation of COX1 mRNA. Despite this knowledge, the molecular mechanisms involved remain unknown.
 RNAs fold into complex structures that are integral to the diverse mechanisms underlying RNA regulation
of gene expression. Recent development of RNA structure profiling through the application of structure-probing
chemicals combined with high-throughput sequencing (such as DMS-MaPseq) has opened a new field that
enormously expands the amount of RNA structural information available. With this technology available, here
we propose to test the hypothesis that mutations in either LRPPRC or TACO1 lead to a downstream defect
in the folding of mitochondrial mRNAs and subsequently to aberrant mtDNA gene expression. To test
this hypothesis, we will follow two Aims and will use human cell lines knockout (KO) for each gene, which we
are generating by using innovative CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing approaches. In Aim 1, the KO lines will be
reconstituted with wild-type or disease mutant gene variants and characterized physiologically in terms of cellular
and mitochondrial bioenergetics, mitochondrial RNA processing and stability, as well as mitochondrial translation.
Preliminary data on already available LRPPRC-KO cell lines have informed mitochondrial phenotypes
compatible with those of LS patients. This will follow with establishment of in-cello mRNA binding sites of these
proteins in wild-type cells using PAR-CLIP approaches. Finally, we will utilize ribosome-profiling assays to
determine whether LRPPRC and TACO1 are binding their target mRNAs during translation. In Aim 2 we will use
DMS-MaPseq to probe the native structures of the entire mitochondrial transcriptome in the KO and reconstituted
cell lines. To ensure success in this undertaking, we will capitalize on our collaboration with Dr. Silvia Rouskin,
the pioneer of DMS-MaPseq. We expect to answer basic questions regarding how these proteins interact with
mRNA, affect their folding, and ultimately their stability, modification and translation. To fully understand the
basic pathogenic mechanisms underlying the several LS forms is critical to the NICHD mission and a
fundamental pre-requisite to develop therapeutics to target this kind of disorders. With this perspective, the
proposed project is tailored to my training towards becoming a skilled physician scientist."
10749014,"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) affects almost a quarter million patients annually,
and is responsible for 3.6 million hospital days. ARDS has a mortality rate approaching 40%,
and its primary causes are pneumonia and sepsis. Central to the pathophysiology of this lung
injury is a sustained inflammatory response, which leads to mitochondrial damage, alveolar
epithelia injury, and contributes to the formation of edema and impairment of gas exchange
across the alveolus. Clinical treatment for ARDS is largely supportive, and many interventions
(e.g. T-cell receptor blockades, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, cytokine blocking antibodies
or corticosteroids) have not improved outcomes in ARDS. Thus, there is an unmet need for
new therapies to reduce the high morbidity and mortality associated with ARDS. Protein
ubiquitination is the major protein processing pathways in cells by which ubiquitin (Ub) flags a
targeted protein for degradation through the 26s proteasome or lysosome. It plays such a critical
role in biological processes and its dysregulation leads to many diseases. Unfortunately,
bacterial infection often disrupts the protein ubiquitination process. We and many other
investigators have shown that infection or other inflammatory stimuli will alter the mRNA and
protein levels of Ub E3 ligases, thus affecting the levels and functions of their target proteins.
Thus, uncovering new Ub E3 ligase-based molecular pathways that contribute to lung
injury provides unique opportunities to potentially devise new strategies to attenuate
ARDS. We propose a systematic analysis of protein ubiquitination networks in ARDS, which has
not been executed before. We have already identified several high value protein targets and laid
out the experiment plans. These studies will add to the investigation into this exciting and
critically important area of lung injury and inflammation. Specifically, we will focus on identifying
novel molecular pathways that modulate the inflammatory cascade, mitochondria
function/mitophagy, and DAMPs/inflammasome activation in the lung, and develop novel
therapeutics for ARDS. In all three areas, we will systematically investigate how and which
protein ubiquitination processes are dysregulated during lung injury. We will carry out state-of-
the-art High-Throughput Screening (HTS) to identify the relevant E3 ligase/substrate pathways
in the lung injury process. We will examine the process of protein ubiquitination using
sophisticated biochemical tools, which will provide detailed mechanistic data such as substrate
ubiquitination site and E3 ligase binding motif. Molecular and genetic approaches (such as
Crispr/Cas9 gene editing and in vivo gene transfer) will be used to study the functions of E3
ligase/substrate in lung injury. We will also use our drug discovery expertise to develop small
molecules for use in preclinical lung injury models. This proposal will lay the groundwork for
futures studies involving the discovery of small molecules targeting protein
ubiquitination pathways in ARDS."

 The retina is a complex tissue composed of seven major cell types. Each of these cell types is needed
for normal retinal function and therefore vision. All cells in the mammalian retina are formed during development
and must last the lifetime of the animal. The production of three retinal cell types is dependent on the expression
of Otx2, a homeodomain transcription factor. Otx2 is expressed during retinal development by precursors that
give rise to five cell types, but it is only maintained by photoreceptors and bipolar cells into maturity. Loss-of-
function studies show that mice lacking Otx2 cannot produce cone or rod photoreceptors, nor bipolar cell
interneurons. Thus, cell fate decisions in the retina depend heavily on where and when Otx2 is expressed.
 To understand how Otx2 expression is regulated, we searched for its enhancers. Enhancers are non-
coding regions of DNA that initiate and stabilize gene expression. Three potential enhancers of Otx2 were
identified and shown to be expressed by OTX2+ cells. We next tested whether these enhancers were necessary
for Otx2 expression. CRISPR-mediated deletion of one enhancer, DHS4, revealed a reduction in OTX2
expression embryonically yet the effect on postnatal OTX2 expression was modest. This suggested that other
Otx2 enhancers are utilized in postnatal retinal development. To investigate this, I conducted CRISPR deletion
experiments on the other two enhancers of Otx2, termed DHS2 and DHS15. Deletion of either enhancer showed
a stronger reduction in OTX2 expression postnatally than DHS4. Interestingly, deleting both enhancers
simultaneously did not have an additive effect on OTX2 reduction at later timepoints, suggesting that the complex
landscape of Otx2 enhancers allows them to substitute for each other. My observations led me to hypothesize
that a dynamic enhancer complex initiates and maintains Otx2 expression during retinal development.
 I will test this hypothesis in my proposal by completing two specific aims. In my first aim, I will employ a
high-resolution chromosome conformation capture technique to reveal enhancer-promoter contacts at the Otx2
locus across retinal development. Additionally, this technique will reveal other potential enhancers of Otx2. In
my second aim, I will test how this enhancer complex is disrupted when enhancers are perturbed. To do this, I
will combine chromosome conformation capture with CRISPR-based enhancer perturbation techniques. This will
allow me to discern enhancer dynamics and determine how enhancers compensate for each other to ensure
Otx2 expression during retinal development. The completion of this proposal will improve our understanding of
retinal development, complex gene regulatory mechanisms and provide me with the experience needed to
continue onto a successful career leading my own academic lab."

Social isolation increases risk of all-cause mortality and chronic diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular disease,
dementia, and stroke.12,13 A lack of social connectedness, or isolation, is exacerbated with age due to partner loss,
family disconnect, and a narrowing of social networks. However, with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and long
periods of social distancing, social isolation has become a widespread phenomenon. As such, it is urgent to
elucidate the physiological effects of social isolation (SI) and subsequent vulnerability to injury or disease.
Stroke is a leading cause of death worldwide and is the cause of 1 in 6 cardiovascular related deaths. Ischemic
stroke accounts for over 80% of overall incidence.14,15 Social isolation after stroke is of clinical relevance due to
the recovery process requiring patients to spend many hours in physical and occupational therapies away from
family members, loss of mobility, and language impairment. Thus while social isolation in stroke patients has
often been studied during the recovery period,16,17 a recent study showed that the risk of death due to stroke was
higher when comparing the most isolated patients to the least isolated patients prior to stroke.18 In the following
proposed studies the overarching hypothesis that prior-social isolation (SI) mediates worsened stroke
outcomes will be tested. The immediate goal is to identify, if any, sex differences in prior-SI and stroke severity.
The long-term goal is to understand the mechanism by which prior-SI affects stroke severity and propose a
potential therapy for mitigating harmful effects of prior-SI. This will be studied in the following 3 aims:
Aim 1: To investigate the effect of pre-stroke social isolation on stroke severity and outcome.
-Sub-Aim 1a: To investigate the hypothesis that prior-SIS worsens acute post-stroke outcomes.
-Sub-Aim 1b: To investigate the hypothesis that prior SIS worsens post-stroke cognitive impairment.
Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that stroke outcomes are exacerbated by prior social isolation stress (SIS) due to
maladaptive cellular changes and inflammation in the central nervous system.
-Sub Aim 2a: To test the hypothesis that prior-SIS increases stroke-induced blood brain barrier permeability.
-Sub Aim 2b: To test the hypothesis that prior-SIS will induce a neuroinflammatory state in which microglia and
astrocytes become activated, leading to worsened stroke outcomes.
Considering the extensive isolation undergone by the majority of the population throughout the COVID-19
pandemic, it is critical to consider the long-term effects of prior-SIS on stroke. These findings advance our
understanding and awareness of the future implications of COVID-19. This training plan's focus on elucidating
the effects of stressors on brain health and vulnerability to disease fit well with my goal of becoming a physician
scientist in the field of neurology. The procedures described in this application are well established in the
sponsor's lab, and the pilot data was acquired by me while learning these techniques."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest adult cancers with a 5-year survival rate of
only 11% and is one of the top five leading causes of cancer-related deaths for men and women in the United
States. These dire statistics underscore the need for a better understanding of the mechanisms that promote
pancreatic cancer initiation and progression. Recent studies have begun to show that metaplastic epithelial
differentiation in pancreatic cancer can significantly impact disease progression. Our preliminary data from
ongoing studies investigating the role of cytokines IL-12/IL-23 in pancreatic cancer cell differentiation showed
that gain of aggressive epithelial to mesenchymal-like phenotype is associated with the concurrent loss of gastric
lineage genes, including Gastrokine 2 (Gkn2). Gkn2 is abundantly expressed by normal stomach epithelial cells,
plays an anti-inflammatory role in gastric epithelial homeostasis. Recently, Gkn2 and its family member Gkn1
have been shown to be de novo upregulated in metaplastic epithelial cells in pancreatic cancer. However, the
functional roles of gastrokines in pancreatic tumorigenesis remain unclear. The goals of this proposal are to
elucidate the kinetics, cellular source, and driver(s) of de novo Gkn2 expression in pancreatic neoplasia, as well
as determine the functional role of Gkn2 in pancreatic cancer development. To achieve these goals, in Aim 1,
we will determine the expression pattern and cellular identity of Gkn2-positive cells, as well as understand how
oncogenic Kras and/or Src signaling may contribute to the expression of Gkn2 in pancreatic epithelial cells. In
Aim 2, we will investigate the functional role of Gkn2 in pancreatic tumor growth, tumor cell differentiation, and
invasion. Specifically, we will utilize reversible Gkn2 knockdown systems to determine its contribution to the
growth and differentiation of Kras-transformed epithelial cells in pancreatic cancer. Our proposed research will
utilize state-of-the art models to provide an understanding of how a gastric identity gene program emerges early
in transformed pancreatic epithelium and acts as a potential impediment to the aggressive progression of cancer."

 The prevalence of Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing worldwide, affecting a quarter of
the global population. NAFLD may progress to its more severe form, Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which
will become the number one indication for liver transplant. While there are over 400 ongoing NAFLD-related
clinical trials, there are no FDA-approved therapies. There is an immediate need for strategies to counteract
NAFLD/NASH development and progression throughout the world. However, little is known about its
pathophysiology. Western diet contributes to disease pathogenesis, mediated in part by the gut microbiome.
Epidemiological studies indicate dietary cholesterol closely associates with the incidence of late-stage NAFLD.
However, the influences of Western dietary components, such as cholesterol, on gut microbiota are largely
unknown. There is a considerable gap in knowledge regarding the mechanistic relationships between
discrete Western dietary components, gut microbiota, and the development of NAFLD/NASH. Preliminary
studies show Western diets containing high levels of cholesterol induce gut microbial imbalances that precede
and are a prerequisite for NAFLD/NASH in Specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice, yet germ-free (GF) mice that lack
a gut microbiome are protected from disease. Bifidobacteria are key commensal organisms that are beneficial
to the host and are commonly downregulated in metabolic disorders such as NAFLD/NASH. However,
environmental cues that drive a loss of Bifidobacteria remain elusive. Preliminary studies show they are lost from
the gut upon high-cholesterol feeding in a dose-dependent manner and their relative abundance is negatively
correlated with liver damage. These data strongly suggest diet drives a loss of Bifidobacteria which compromises
the host and contributes to NAFLD/NASH pathogenesis. It is critical to define the underlying mechanisms if
microbiome-based therapeutic strategies against NAFLD/NASH are to be developed. The goal of this proposal
is to define the role of dietary cholesterol in driving gut microbial imbalances in NAFLD/NASH pathogenesis. I
hypothesize dietary cholesterol drives gut Bifidobacteria elimination which promotes a proinflammatory microbial
milieu during the pathogenesis of NAFLD/NASH. To test this hypothesis, I will utilize a combination of in vitro, in
vivo, and bioinformatics techniques to 1) Determine critical functional elements that impact Bifidobacteria’s
capacity to sustain a niche in the presence of high dietary cholesterol alone vs. within a complex gut microbiota
community in NAFLD/NASH development and 2) Elucidate the indirect effect of dietary cholesterol mediated
through altered bile acid profile on loss of Bifidobacteria from a complex gut microbiota community in
NAFLD/NASH development. By exposing me to central aspects of microbiome research, these studies provide
the perfect vehicle for my training and will propel me toward achieving my goal of becoming a Principal
Investigator studying interactions between diet, gut microbes, and metabolic disease at a R1 institution."

environmental exposures that may be prevented through policy, programs, and practices, and to identify
positive influences in the preconception, prenatal, and postnatal periods that may be promoted to mitigate
health risks associated with adverse early-life exposures. We will leverage our local investigator and staff
expertise to enroll pregnant people, their conceiving partners, and their offspring from a large network of
Federally Qualified Health Centers serving a racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse population in
Denver, Colorado. In Aim 1, we propose to utilize the breadth of Core data elements in the ECHO Cohort
Protocol to answer solution-oriented research questions regarding the link between early-life exposures and
childhood health outcomes, and to identify modifiable prenatal and postnatal factors that may minimize risk. In
Aim 2, we propose to implement novel and scalable Specialized measures to determine biological pathways
linking parent and family lifestyle factors and the physical/chemical environment of early life with child obesity
and neurodevelopment, and to identify susceptible periods for these exposures in early life. In Aim 3, we
describe our plans to recruit and follow a diverse cohort of over 800 pregnant people with their conceiving
partner and offspring, and to additionally enroll over 300 participants with a high probability of subsequent
pregnancy into a preconception study. In Aim 4, we propose research questions that utilize data elements
collected during the preconception period, to identify parental preconception exposures that adversely affect
child health outcomes, and to describe molecular markers that may mediate these effects. Our team of expert
investigators is well-positioned to contribute to the development of the ECHO specialized exposure and
outcome protocols, and to the design and implementation the preconception pilot study. Our experienced staff
and MPI team will ensure successful recruitment and implementation of the ECHO Cohort Protocol to provide
a robust sample size and high-quality data. We will lead ECHO-wide analyses to address pressing questions in
the early-life origins of child health and disease, and to identify potential targets for prevention of adverse
environmental exposures and for promotion of protective factors in early life."

Enterocutaneous fistula (ECF) is an abnormal connection between the bowel and skin. It can be associated with
discharge of pus, feces, and stomach contents and can even lead to incontinence. ECFs are referred to as
surgical tragedies in the literature, as up to 85% are the result of intraabdominal surgical complications, such as
missed enterotomies or anastomotic leaks. This can lead to constant leakage of enteric and fecal contents from
the skin, sometimes up to many liters per day. The foul enteric contents act as a chemical irritant to the skin,
leading to skin breakdown and predisposition to infection. Despite advances in treatment, ECFs still account for
significant mortality of 15-20% and are associated with debilitating morbidity and substantially poor quality of life
due to complex wound care, severe malnutrition, frequent infectious complications, pain, and depression.
Despite advances in surgical techniques and postoperative management, no successful treatment of ECF exists
today. The current treatment paradigm is unsuccessful; high fistula discharge, infection, and chronic
inflammation lead to high failure and recurrence rates. This often results in prolonged intensive care unit (ICU)
stays increasing health care cost which can be over $500,000 per ICU visit. We hypothesize that by using a
bioengineered biomaterial that is biocompatible, non-toxic, durable, antimicrobial and regenerative, we would
change the standard of medical practice in the approach to ECF. This creative approach may reduce world-wide
morbidity and mortality by successfully occluding and healing any ECF, preventing fecal leakage; it will also
substantially improve the quality of life of the patient and reduce the need for repeated interventions and X-ray
imaging. We aim to make a paradigm shift in the treatment of potentially fatal ECF using a minimally invasive
blood-derived biomaterial-based platform to occlude the fistulous tract using groundbreaking injectable shear-
thinning platelet-rich gels. We will engineer the blood derived biomaterial to include antimicrobial, adhesive, and
regenerative components that will be tested in vitro and in vivo (Aim 1) and we will evaluate the optimized
biomaterial with established rodent fistula models (Aim 2). Finally, we will test theses engineered biomaterials in
a porcine ECF model to promote aseptic healing of fistulas (Aim 3). We will evaluate healing trajectories of the
fistulas using clinical observation, fluoroscopy, ultrasound, micro-CT, histology, Helios mass cytometer analysis
of the cellular populations and the Hyperion imaging technology to evaluate up to 37 biomarkers on slides and
RNA sequencing."
10746092,"Project Summary and Relevance.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a worldwide health problem. It is estimated that there
are 200 to 500 million HBV chronic carriers in the world for whom, to date, there is no
reliable treatment. HBV causes both acute and chronic liver disease and is responsible
for an estimated one million deaths annually from liver cirrhosis and primary hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC). Currently available therapies reduce viral loads but fail to resolve
chronic HBV infections and hence require lifelong treatment. A major obstacle to the
resolution of chronic HBV infections is the limited number of HBV targets that are suitable
for the development of antiviral therapies. All the current antiviral therapies target the HBV
reverse transcriptase/DNA polymerase, often leading to the development of drug-resistant
variants. Curative therapies will require the identification of additional antiviral targets.
Cellular gene products that make a significant contribution to HBV biosynthesis represent
potential additional antiviral targets which alone or in combination with current HBV
reverse transcriptase inhibitors may represent a potential curative therapy. One potential
cellular gene target that might represent an HBV antiviral target is β-catenin, the terminal
mediator of the Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction pathway which can be inhibited by the
FDA-approved drug, Pyrvinium. Preliminary data indicate that β-catenin can activated
HBV transcription and replication in cell culture and β-catenin activity correlates with viral
biosynthesis in vivo in the HBV transgenic mouse model of chronic viral infection.
Consequently, cell culture analysis will be performed to define the molecular mechanisms
mediating β-catenin enhanced HBV transcription and replication. Characterization of
inducible liver-specific β-catenin-null and APC-null (β-catenin activated) HBV transgenic
mice will indicate the in vivo contribution of β-catenin to the restricted localization of viral
biosynthesis to pericentral hepatocytes within the liver lobule and restricted viral
expression within HCC tissue. Furthermore, treatment of HBV replicating cells and
transgenic mice with Pyrvinium will indicate if an available FDA approved drug can
modulate the Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction pathway and act as an antiviral therapy.
Defining the role of the Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction pathway in determining the level
of HBV biosynthesis may lead to the identification of cellular therapeutic targets that are
amenable to the further development of novel modalities to resolve rather than simply treat
chronic HBV infection."

 Insulin-secreting b-cells within the pancreatic islets of Langerhans are absolutely required for glucose
homeostasis. Loss of b-cell survival or function are hallmarks of type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus, respectively,
which affects millions of Americans, with numbers expected to greatly increase. This has created enormous
economic and health care burdens. Improvements in diabetic therapies will require the deeper understanding
of novel mouse and human b-cell regulators and/or pathways directly implicated in b-cell function, including
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS).
 The LIM-Homeodomain class transcription factor Islet-1 (Isl1) is an islet-enriched regulator of
pancreatic islet cell development, maturation, and function. Despite this, little is known of the transcriptional
mechanisms or protein interactors employed by Isl1 to elicit these functions in mouse or human b-cells. To
identify components of Isl1 transcriptional complexes, we performed reverse-crosslinked immunoprecipitation
and mass spectroscopy experiments using mouse b-cells. We found the novel Isl1 interactors Ring Finger
(Rnf)20 and Rnf40, which are E3 ubiquitin ligases that act as a homo- or hetero-dimeric complex to promote
transcription via specifically mono-ubiquitinating histone H2B (H2Bub1), a precursor to active histone 3 lysine 4
trimethylation (H34me3). In vitro assays with b-cell lines revealed that (at least) Rnf20 is required for the
expression of many Isl1 target genes (e.g., Glut2, MafA, Ins1), as well as GSIS. Strikingly, we also found that
reduction of Rnf20 or Isl1 in b-cell lines reduced H2Bub1 and H3K4me3 marks in vitro, thus linking Isl1:Rnf20
to b-cell epigenetics. Our preliminary mouse knockout data support that Rnf20 may act as a homodimer (i.e.,
without Rnf40) to drive Isl1-mediated target gene regulation in mouse b-cells. Therefore, in this proposal we
will compare the functional and transcriptional impacts in mouse models of Isl1 or Rnf20 deficiency, as well as
in human b-cells lacking ISL1, RNF20, or RNF40. Our central hypothesis is that b-cell formation and function
requires deposition of the H2Bub1 modification by recruited Isl1:Rnf20. We designed three specific aims that
will examine the relative functional and gene expression importance of Isl1 and Rnf20 (and thus H2Bub1) in
embryonic and adult mouse b-cells, and also in adult human b-cells. Results reported from these studies will
establish Rnf20 and the H2Bub1 epigenetic mark as fundamental gene regulatory effectors of Isl1, thus
impacting mouse and human b-cell function. Concepts learned will yield new insight into development of novel
diabetes drugs or enhance strategies to produce therapeutic b-like cells in vitro."

This study represents a timely investigation that addresses race/ethnic disparities in type 2 diabetes (T2DM)
care over a period that included a major pandemic shock. T2DM is burdensome and disproportionately impacts
vulnerable and disenfranchised populations; of note, there are stark race/ethnic disparities in T2DM care goals,
emergency department (ED) visits, and hospitalizations. Medicaid covers 25% of Americans with T2DM. More
than 80% of Medicaid beneficiaries nationally receive at least some of their care from Medicaid managed care
organizations (MMCO). States contract with private (non-profit or for-profit) MMCOs to lower costs, increase
quality, and pass on financial risks of covering Medicaid beneficiaries. Heterogeneity across and within state
programs can have implications for quality of T2DM care and, specifically, race/ethnic disparities through
benefit generosity or by affecting MMCO entry and post-entry behavior. State policymakers also have
significant influence over marketplaces in which MMCOs compete, which can have consequences for
race/ethnic disparities, given that Medicaid disproportionately covers non-white populations. Little is known
about whether and how MMCOs and the state programs they operate in influence disparities in T2DM care
and, if or how the COVID-19 pandemic changed the trajectory of health disparities. We propose to answer
these unknowns using a convergent mixed-methods study: we will compile a database of MMCO/state
program features that could influence care using a health disparities conceptual framework (Aim 1); we will
empirically explore race/ethnic disparities among adults with T2DM and whether these vary by MMCO/state
features and pre-/post-COVID-19 using comprehensive data from the Transformed Medicaid Statistical
Information System over 2016-2025 (Aims 2 and 3); and we will collect and analyze qualitative data from
Medicaid stakeholders to triangulate and contextualize the quantitative findings (Aim 4). We focus on non-
disabled, non-pregnant 18-64-year-old adults with T2DM who tend to remain stably covered by Medicaid over
time. To reduce selection bias, we focus our analyses on 12 states and the District of Columbia that mandate
enrollment in comprehensive MMCOs. We will use panel data models to examine race/ethnic and sex-specific
receipt of key T2DM services and ED visits and hospitalizations, overall and by MMCO/state features. We will
also follow a continuously enrolled cohort over 2020-2025 to assess if and how MMCO/state program features
moderate the pandemic’s effects on T2DM disparities. Sensitivity analyses will explore the influence of churn.
Further, our preliminary analyses identify Kentucky and Florida as having the lowest and highest disparities in
T2DM care, respectively; we will conduct interviews in these states to examine what MMCO/state features and
implementation might explain these disparities. This policy-relevant work will provide critical insights into how
Medicaid managed care programs can be designed to reduce disparities in chronic disease burdens."
10850552,"SUMMARY
The factors that underline susceptibility to oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC; thrush) caused by Candida albicans
in different populations are not well understood. In individuals with specific monogenic disorders, OPC
susceptibility is dictated by defects in mucosal immune defenses and/or epithelial barrier function. In cancer
patients undergoing chemotherapy, OPC has been attributed to the severity of leukopenia, but there is
incomplete understanding of the role other predisposing factors play in this setting. Mouse models have shown
that oral bacteria contribute to the severity of chemotherapy-associated OPC by promoting C. albicans
filamentation and epithelial damage. There is a need, however, to obtain evidence from human studies on factors
that predispose patients receiving chemotherapy to OPC, including an understanding of the role played by
bacteria, and a delineation of the host antifungal defenses that when compromised by chemotherapy lead to
OPC. The study of OPC susceptibility in chemotherapy is facilitated by the opportunity to evaluate individuals
prior to and during progression of OPC. This proposal is based on preliminary data obtained in a recent pilot
study using this unique clinical model in which we established that host clinical characteristics and the oral
microbiome composition assessed prior to chemotherapy constitute risk factors for OPC. We also evaluated the
manner in which chemotherapy predisposes to OPC, discovering hyposalivation and neutropenia as important
contributors. These results suggest a multi-factorial etiology for OPC during chemotherapy. The goal of this
proposal is to determine the factors that underline susceptibility to OPC in chemotherapy recipients. Through
clinical and in vitro mechanistic studies, this proposal will test the hypothesis that specific clinical, immunological
and microbial characteristics dictate susceptibility to OPC during chemotherapy. To gain a better understanding
of the pathophysiology of OPC during chemotherapy three specific aims are proposed. In Aim 1 we will develop
a machine-learning model based on baseline medical and oral characteristics and the oral microbiome to predict
OPC incidence in chemotherapy recipients. We anticipate creating a tool to identify, pre-infusion, individuals
susceptible to OPC. In Aim 2, we will identify, longitudinally, the interactions between chemotherapy, salivary
antifungal defenses, mucosal integrity and the oral microbiome that are associated with OPC incidence. We
expect these studies will reveal the host and microbiome factors that when affected by chemotherapy predispose
to OPC. In Aim 3, we will evaluate through in vitro studies the potential for bacterial species associated with OPC
lesions to modify the virulence of C. albicans. These studies will identify critical bacterial partners of C. albicans
and elucidate the manner in which inter-kingdom interactions may contribute to chemotherapy-associated OPC.
Altogether, these studies will provide clinically-relevant evidence on the etiology of OPC during chemotherapy
that we expect will contribute to guide the development of preventive and therapeutic interventions."

The goal of this study is to develop an RNAi-based genetic precision medicine to treat alcohol associated liver
disease (AALD). AALD is a devastating health problem worldwide, accounts for the majority of alcohol-related
mortality globally and is the second most indication for liver transplantation in the US. The current medical
management for AALD remains limited, and no proven pathobiology-driven pharmacotherapy is available. There
is thus an urgent need to identify novel targets and develop promising therapies for both prevention and treatment
for AALD. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has identified that a single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP rs738409 C>G, or amino acid alteration at position 148 I>M) in the patatin-like phospholipase domain
containing 3 (PNPLA3) gene is the single largest genetic risk factor contributing to the progression of AALD to
advanced liver perturbations including liver cancer. The PNPLA3 148 I>M polymorphism is the molecular reason
why this subset of AALD patients develop severe liver injuries. Mechanistic studies have revealed that
overexpression of the mutant PNPLA3 (the 148M isoform) is underlying both liver steatosis and fibrosis and
inflammation by interrupting hepatic triglyceride metabolism. Our creation of a humanized PNPLA3148M mouse
model successfully recapitulates the AALD phenotypes and has corroborated the aforementioned mechanism.
We hypothesize that transcriptional downregulation of the PNPLA3148M isoform is a cause-targeting strategy for
the treatment of AALD with the PNPLA3148M allele. To this end, we pioneered the development and have issued
patents for a precision allele-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) that possesses excellent specificity for the
PNPLA3148M isoform compared to its wild-type counterpart. We further discovered two more modified
oligonucleotides which significantly improved the medicinal chemistry specifications of our therapeutic lead.
Administration of our lead siRNA to the liver of the humanized PNPLA3148M model fed an ethanol-containing diet
significantly reduced the PNPLA3148M expression as well as hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. We also
demonstrated that delivering our siRNA into the humanized PNPLA3148M model with the N-Acetylgalactosamine
(GalNAc)-conjugation, a well-established liver-specific drug delivery strategy, effectively knocked down hepatic
hPNPLA3148M mRNA and ameliorated the liver histology. With this success, we propose to advance our drug
candidate development by focusing on an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA. Specifically,
we aim: 1) to define the best drug candidate of our hPNPLA3148M-targeting, GalNAc-conjugated oligonucleotides
(Phase I); 2) to collect IND-enabling quality assurance and safety data in rodents and non-human primates
(Phase II). We expect that via this study, we will develop the first genetic medicine for AALD treatment, which
could also serve as a new prototype for drug development for other common human diseases. The collected
data in this study will enable us to file the IND application to support our first clinical trial in humans."

This project has potential to illuminate a very large but poorly understood component of the human genome, as we seek to find meaningful information in non-coding, repeat-rich sequence, the bulk of our genomes. Emerging evidence shows that much of the non-coding genome is expressed, but often at low levels. A few clearly functional long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are known, yet it remains unclear whether thousands of other low-level, mostly nuclear, lncRNAs are functionally relevant. Based on much progress in the current cycle, we are primed to further advance a broad, impactful hypothesis for how “junk RNAs” may collectively contribute to genome regulation. Our recent work suggests that many long repeat rich (Cot-1) RNAs (including lncRNAs and introns/pre-mRNAs), are not just “products”, but serve essentially as dynamic components of open euchromatin structure. This current MIRA grant represents the convergence of two previously separate projects, one which focused on the long non-coding XIST RNA which transforms an active X-chromosome to a condense heterochromatic Barr Body, and the other focused on nuclear organization of active genes. However, our insights increasingly indicated there was a telling dichotomy between the two, unified by the hypothesis that XIST RNA is not a special example of RNA that impacts chromosome architecture, but exemplifies a much broader aspect of genome/chromosome biology. Rather than XIST RNA simply tethered to chromatin to modify histones, our findings support that XIST RNA also functions to directly modify components of an “RNP-scaffold” that influences the heterochromatin versus euchromatic state. Other recent evidence suggests the RNP-scaffold may be disrupted in certain disease states. As we investigate RNA involvement in chromosome structure at the sequence level, we will seek to connect that to an overall vision of how chromosomes are organized at a much larger scale, and coordinately regulated through development. These ambitious goals will be bolstered by a strong collaborative team, with Dr. Zhiping Weng and Dr. Daryl Bosco."

Gilliland and senior leaders developed a strategic plan through a process started when he arrived in 2015. The
process is ongoing by design with annual internal and external evaluations of milestones. Throughout the
process Administration ensures that CCSG guidelines are integral to the strategic goals and activities. As a
result of these activities, Consortium membership has grown by >170 members; cancer-relevant grant funding
for the Consortium is at $242M, of which $50M is from the NCI; interventional trials have 5,424 accruals and
non-interventional trials have 5,292 accruals (increases of 83% and 20%, respectively, from FY 2014 to FY
2018); and members have over 6,600 cancer-related publications as authors and co-authors, with 11% of them
in journals with impact factors greater than 20.
New in this cycle of the CCSG are the components for Community Outreach & Engagement (COE) and
Cancer Research Career Enhancement (CRCE). Administration has been pivotal to establishing offices for
both of these new components to oversee their respective areas of activity. Other new Consortium initiatives
include the formation of three Integrated Research Centers (IRCs), the continued development of the Seattle
Translational Tumor Research initiative (STTR), and major enhancements of clinical trials infrastructure.
Administration has interfaced with initiative leaders and their respective administrators in order to leverage
strengths and resources toward supporting Research Programs and members. Finally, as a result of faculty
feedback, a new developing Shared Resource for preclinical mouse models was developed by Administration
to further Consortium science.

This proposal requests a renewal and expansion of our existing T32 research training grant, from 4 to 6 pre-
doctoral trainees and from 2 to 4 post-doctoral trainees annually. The Yale program is based in the Department
of Health Policy and Management in the School of Public Health, engaging core faculty from two other
departments within YSPH and ten other departments outside YSPH. The program is now in its fifteenth year,
having supported 36 trainees (19 pre-docs and 17 post-docs). The metrics of success are clear: trainees
complete the program in a timely manner; trainees have published XX unique articles based on their program
engagement; 95% of those who have completed the program are currently in research-intensive or research-
related positions, many at top-tier universities. Our rationale for the proposed expansion is based on the
program’s distinctive approach to its mission: to train young scholars who are skilled at working in cross-
disciplinary teams, who are committed to tackling problems of real-world importance, and who are engaged in
the process not simply of creating policy-relevant findings, but also translating those findings into practice. The
program design reflects these objectives. It incorporates multiple mentors for each trainee to provide them with
cross-disciplinary exposure; it integrates trainees into a highly collaborative network of research preceptors,
embodying our expectations that trainees will be willing and able to pursue team science throughout their
careers. The program fosters a commitment to translating research into practice by requiring predoctoral
trainees to pursue applied field experience (the TRIPP) to help them better understand the practical and
institutional realities of the fields affected by their research. Post-doctoral trainees learn methods for
community-based participatory research to complement their other methodological skills. Both pre- and post-
doctoral trainees can connect with two centers advancing implementation science, one fostering innovative
methods, the other exemplary stakeholder engagement. Over its history, the program has evolved to more
effectively foster in young scholars a commitment to research that has lasting impact. Over the next five years,
we anticipate continued evolution, most notably incorporating (a) an enriched exposure to cutting-edge
methods to allow trainees not only to assess and but also to enhance healthcare equity, (b) analytic skills
needed to tackle emerging health threats, such as policy modeling to inform responses to COVID and other
emergent health threats, and (c) an expanded integration of clinicians into post-doctoral training in ways that
enrich their abilities and those of non-clinician trainees."

 The essential human enzyme O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) catalyzes a unique type of intracellular protein
glycosylation called O-GlcNAcylation. In response to nutrient levels and stress, OGT dynamically regulates a
variety of physiological and pathological processes including the “Warburg effect” in cancer cells and insulin
resistance in diabetes. Previous studies on the OGT active site have made fundamental discoveries on its
catalytic mechanism and substrate interactions. However, how OGT regulates protein- and site-specific O-
GlcNAcylation remains unclear. This is due to a number of challenges including: 1) OGT glycosylates thousands
of proteins without a conserved sequence motif near the O-GlcNAc modification site, 2) a majority of O-
GlcNAcylation sites are found on intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), 3) OGT typically binds proteins with
low/moderate affinity, and 4) a lack of OGT-protein complex structures. In our last funding period, we have made
strides in these areas through development of a suite of novel chemical probes that allow us to interrogate OGT
specific interactions with low/moderate affinity for structural, proteomic, and biochemical characterizations. This
proposal aims to make further conceptual and technical breakthroughs toward addressing these longstanding
challenges. It is expected that a better understanding of how OGT interacts with other proteins, particularly
through the regions beyond the OGT catalytic site, will be essential for understanding OGT’s functional regulation
at protein- and site-specific levels, filling major knowledge gaps between decades of biological observations of
OGT’s nutrient sensing and other regulatory roles, and will support the need to specifically modulate OGT
functions for biomedical applications."
10928734,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Persistent activity in neural circuits supports a variety of brain functions from motor control to navigation to
perceptual decision-making. Correlational studies show significant variation in persistent activity patterns during
different behaviors, suggesting that individual circuits perform flexible computations that depend on the context
of ongoing brain activity and motor functioning. However, establishing the causal significance of this variability
is difficult due to technical limitations in existing tools for precisely manipulating circuit dynamics. A tractable
system for overcoming this challenge is the zebrafish, a vertebrate model organism with an optically accessible
brain that allows simultaneous calcium imaging and optogenetic stimulation with laser microscopy. Research in
our lab focuses on the zebrafish oculomotor integrator, a hindbrain circuit involved in adaptive control of gaze
position. This circuit generates persistent activity that directly drives easily quantified motor behavior. In prior
work, our lab found that different patterns of integrator activity are associated with distinct types of eye
movements, but it is unclear how these context-dependent dynamics contribute to oculomotor control and how
they relate to the development of sophisticated behavior. In the proposed research, I will conduct simultaneous
two-photon imaging and optogenetic stimulation during visuomotor behavior to determine how different patterns
of integrator dynamics contribute to different types of eye movements. First, I will collect a comprehensive
longitudinal dataset of brain-wide neural activity in the larval and juvenile zebrafish during a broad range of
oculomotor behaviors, testing if indeed the number of persistent patterns in the integrator expands with the
behavioral repertoire. Then, I will perform real-time closed-loop stimulation of the integrator network at single-
cell resolution, steering circuit dynamics along specific patterns of activity to test their causal impact on motor
outputs. This research will improve our understanding of flexible control by memory circuits and establish new
paradigms for precise manipulation of network dynamics."

Despite a tremendous effort in basic science, clinical trials, drug development, and technical advances in
surgery and radiation oncology, glioblastoma remains incurable and improvements in overall survival have
been marginal. While radiotherapy is still one of the most effective treatment options for glioblastoma, it cannot
control the disease over time. This suggests that novel combination therapies are desperately needed to
improve radiation treatment outcome for patients suffering from this disease. The studies outlined in this
proposal are based on a hypothesis that is backed by our extensive preliminary data and rigorous published
data in the literature. The overall hypothesis is that biomarker-based drug selection predicts synergistic lethality
of combination therapies in GICs and glioblastoma bulk tumor cell populations, prevents radiation-induced
GBM phenotype conversion and allows for individualized optimization of radiotherapy. The three aims of this
study will address this aspect of glioma biology using an innovative tool to track GICs and their progeny, while
leveraging the unique resources and expertise available at UCLA and the NIH/NCI CTEP portfolio of drugs.
Aim 1 will identify compounds in the NCI CTEP portfolio that interfere with radiation-induced phenotype
conversion in glioblastoma and develop biomarker profiles predictive of synergistic lethality in combination with
radiation. Studies in Aim 2 will optimize combination therapies in vivo. Finally, Aim 3, will use patient avatar
studies to validate biomarker-based drug selection in PDX models of glioblastoma."

10928182,"There are 38 million people living with HIV (PLWH) worldwide, 68% of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa. With
the transition of HIV from an acute illness to a chronic condition, co-morbid non-communicable diseases (NCDs)
such as depression and anxiety disorder, alcohol use disorder (AUD), and hypertension (HTN) have become
epidemic among PLWH. Despite evidence-based interventions to promote integration of these HIV comorbidities
into HIV service delivery, integration efforts face challenges. First, integration commonly fails to recognize the
syndemic relationships between these conditions and the deleterious effect of social factors such as poverty,
stigma, and lack of access to care that worsen their outcomes, especially in low- and middle-income countries.
Second, integration commonly imposes additional clinical tasks upon overburdened healthcare workers (HCW)
operating in busy clinical environments without private space needed to attend to these additional conditions that
are often stigmatized. A syndemic approach, which explicitly integrates the biological and social interactions that
cause these conditions to cluster, has been proposed as a means of addressing the complex needs of PLWH.
Mobile health (mHealth), an evidence-based strategy that leverages the widespread penetration of mobile
phones to relieve HCW of burdensome tasks while enabling their systematic, consistent implementation, has
been proposed as a solution to address HIV-related syndemics, but this approach has not been tested. Our
exemplary multidisciplinary team has a strong track record of collaboration. In the current proposal, which
leverages the infrastructure of an ongoing implementation study of HIV/HTN integration in Uganda, we will
pursue these Specific Aims: Aim 1) Adapt Medly Uganda for detection, linkage to care, and ongoing support of
depression, anxiety disorder, and AUD among Ugandans with HIV and HTN using a syndemic approach.
Through human-centered design (HCD), we will engage patients, caregivers, and professional/lay HCW to guide
iterative adaptation of Medly Uganda with explicit attention to common biosocial drivers. The adapted application
will integrate widely used (1) screening instruments along with validated measures of significant life events,
economic shocks, and stigma, (2) algorithm-driven messaging and alerts, and (3) linkage to HCW for support
and treatment. We will also develop and operationalize a novel syndemic care cascade (R21 phase); Aim 2)
Assess the effectiveness of the Syndemic-Adapted Medly Uganda (SAMU) to improve mental health care
cascade metrics by conducting a single-arm trial using real-world historical data (R33 phase); Aim 3) Evaluate
the factors impacting sustained engagement in the adapted Medly Uganda using mixed methods (R33 phase).
Throughout the study period, we will focus on strengthening our Uganda-based team's mHealth research
capacity and furthering our partnerships with government officials to ensure that SAMU can be locally maintained
and sustained. The proposed study addresses a high priority topic for use of AIDS-designated funds at NIH and
aligns with multiple National Institute of Mental Health priorities as described in PAR-21-303."
10896406,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal centers on the use of T cell receptor (TCR) directed therapy in preclinical glioblastoma (GBM)
models. GBM remains a difficult cancer to treat, and clinical outcomes remain poor. However, despite the
seismic influence of immunotherapy in cancer, there remain no FDA approved immunotherapies for GBM.
There are several reasons that underlie the difficulty in extending immune-based treatments to the central
nervous system (CNS). GBM harbors few T cells and is considered “non-inflamed”, there is a paucity of
dendritic cells in the brain parenchyma, and a myriad of immunosuppressive features has been identified in
patients. The CNS is also immunologically specialized due to the presence of site-specific elements not seen
elsewhere—e.g., lack of lymph nodes, presence of dural lymphatics, and the blood-brain barrier, among
others. Moreover, the genomic landscape of GBM introduces additional obstacles in that many antigenic and
neoantigenic targets are heterogeneously distributed. Importantly, although heterogeneity is a formidable
challenge to immunotherapy, it is poorly modeled in preclinical settings. Despite these barriers, however, the
final goal of CNS immunotherapy—T cell clonal expansion—remains the same. Here, we will test the use of
adoptively transferred TCR directed T cells to treat preclinical GBM as a gateway to understand key
mechanistic principles for ultimate clinical translation. We have assembled a team with Dr. Charest and Dr.
Petti that brings diverse expertise to this work. The proposed work focuses on a novel transgenic mouse that
targets an endogenous neoantigen, mutant Imp3 (mImp3), in the GL261 mouse model. This mouse, the
Mutant Imp3 Specific TransgenIC (MISTIC) mouse, expresses a TCR that recognizes the H2-Db restricted
mImp3 neoantigen and thus represents an exciting model for TCR-directed cell therapy. In Aim 1, we will
dissect the mechanisms underlying MISTIC therapy and also understand the requirement for endogenous
RAG-dependent lymphocyte populations in effective treatment. Additionally, we will develop and study a new,
autochthonous model of spontaneous, EGFR-driven and neoantigenically-defined GBM model to allow us to
study MISTIC cell therapy in physiologic settings. In Aim 2, we will study the observation that a small subset of
mice escape MISTIC therapy and progress after prolonged survival by interrogating the molecular and cellular
basis of resistance by characterizing changes at both the level of the tumor and microenvironment. In Aim 3,
we will use our isogenic, CRISPR-edited GL261 clones with wild type Imp3 to model heterogeneity and explore
the engineering of MISTIC cells with cytokines and chemokines designed to remodel the GBM
microenvironment as a platform to target heterogeneous tumors. We envision this approach as a proof-of -
concept to use single-antigen systems to unleash epitope spreading. Together, these Aims will reveal new
insights from a TCR cell therapy model that will lead to novel autochthonous model development and explore
engineering approaches for GBM heterogeneity that, together, have immediate translational applications."

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for ~10% of all the breast cancer cases, but its survival rate is
lower due to the lack of effective targeted treatments. This underscores the importance of finding new
treatments for therapy-resistant TNBC, which is further complicated by the disease heterogeneity.
Unfortunately, success of targeted therapies in TNBC has been limited, partly due to the lack of a detailed and
mechanistic understanding of the drivers of each disease subgroup. An important contributor to the TNBC
pathobiology is Notch signaling. Hyperactive Notch signaling promotes tumor growth, increases chemotherapy
resistance, decreases survival, and increases the chance of metastases. Although the biomarkers of the
Notch-active TNBC subgroup and drugs to target Notch signaling have been recently developed, treating
patients with Notch inhibitory agents has been ineffective to date, partly due to the limited understanding of
how the Notch signaling controls these fundamental processes.
 An important direct consequence of Notch signaling is to activate key TNBC genes, including MYC,
CCND1 and SOX9. MYC is one of the most important proto-oncogenes promoting tumor growth and survival.
CCND1 controls cell division among other cellular processes. SOX9 increases metastatic potential. Despite
their importance, existing drugs fail to directly target these proteins. We propose to leverage the regulatory
relationships between Notch and its target genes to selectively and efficiently target them. In order to achieve
this goal, we first need to understand the mechanisms by which Notch regulates MYC, CCND1, and SOX9 in
TNBC. We propose to use cutting-edge functional genomics and chromatin conformation assays to elucidate
their Notch-directed regulatory mechanisms at population and single-cell resolutions. To develop more potent
therapeutic options, we plan to use the latest single-cell resolution technologies to discover how drug-resistant
cells circumvent the effect of Notch inhibitory drugs and maintain the expression of these critical Notch targets.
We plan to use this knowledge in the future to tailor therapeutic strategies for individual TNBC patients with
activated Notch signaling, and in the process, hope to improve the survival of patients with this aggressive and
difficult to treat form of breast cancer.

10752749,"It is currently estimated that 10% of the Veteran population aged ≥65 years has Alzheimer’s disease or Alz-
heimer’s disease related dementias (AD/ADRD), and this number is expected to increase by 22% in the next
decade. The Emergency Department (ED) is an essential care setting for these persons living with dementia
(PLWDs), with 40% of community-dwelling PLWDs making at least one ED visit per year. One of the most im-
pactful and costly elements of ED care is the decision to admit a patient to the hospital or discharge them home-
the “disposition” decision. ED providers must balance the risks of unnecessary admissions, such as delirium and
functional decline, against the risks of discharge, which may result in return ED visits and hospitalizations. The
disposition decision is difficult when the need for hospitalization for further testing or monitoring is unclear. It can
also be especially challenging with PLWDs, as they can have difficulties in providing accurate histories to guide
ED testing and diagnosis. There is significant variation in ED disposition practices, driven by factors including
patient sociodemographics and comorbidities, as well as physician risk tolerance. ED providers lack best prac-
tices to incorporate PLWD and caregiver values and preferences in the disposition decision when there is no
serious illness that clearly requires admission. Shared decision making (SDM) tools can facilitate complex con-
versations between patients, caregivers, and ED providers, to ensure that patients and caregivers are meaning-
fully involved in decisions about their care. The research proposed in this application is designed to develop a
shared decision making tool to support ED dispositions that are aligned with PLWD and caregiver goals, and
thereby improve outcomes for Veteran PLWDs and their caregivers.
With the support of her mentorship team, this proposal is also intended to support the continued career devel-
opment of Dr. Justine Seidenfeld, an extremely promising emergency medicine physician-scientist, within the
field of emergency care health services research. During this period of support, she will pursue didactic instruc-
tion and further training to 1) advance her skills in methods for conducting research with PLWDs and their
caregivers, 2) learn best practices to design and implement interventions aligned with end-user needs, and 3)
develop skills for development and testing of SDM tools. The expected outcome of this proposal is to construct
and pilot test a SDM tool to support high-quality ED dispositions for PLWDs. Along with mentored training, this
will position her to submit a competitive Investigator Initiated Research (IIR) application to test its effectiveness
in a fully powered trial. Her long-term career objective is to become an independent health services researcher,
skilled in using diverse methods to promote high-quality ED care for Veterans with dementia.
This study employs a sequential design based on the 3-step decision aid development process created by the
International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS) collaboration. Aims 1 and 2 will address the first “under-
stand user” step through quantitative and qualitative methods. Aim 1 will calculate home time (i.e., days alive
and out of acute and post-acute settings) after an ED visit for a cohort of Veterans with dementia, and identify
Veteran, ED facility, and visit type characteristics that are associated with variation in home time to suggest
groups that may benefit from a customized SDM tool. Aim 2 will use qualitative interviews with Veteran PLWDs,
their caregivers, and ED providers after an ED visit to assess their unmet needs, values, and preferences when
making a disposition decision. To fulfill the “development/refinement” and “assessment” steps of the IPDAS de-
velopment process, Aim 3a will create and iteratively refine a prototype SDM tool with feedback from a multidis-
ciplinary collaborator panel, and Aim 3b will then use a iterative cohort pilot study design to assess the feasibility
and acceptability among PLWDs, caregivers, and ED providers."

The central nervous system plays a pivotal role in metabolism, within which the ventromedial
hypothalamus (VMH) is crucial for proper regulation of body weight and blood glucose level. The VMH
senses nutrients and circulating hormones and integrates its metabolic information to coordinate effector
responses to maintain organismal homeostasis. O-linked beta-D-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc)
modification, catalyzed by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), is considered a cellular sensor of nutrients and
hormones. Our recent studies reveal that OGT in the VMH is required for promoting adipose tissue
lipolysis and maintaining energy balance by regulating the VMH neuronal activity and sympathetic
innervations to white adipose tissues. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that VMH O-GlcNAc
signaling determines a body weight setpoint by means of humoral and nutritional sensing and filtering
lipolytic information to white adipose tissues. To test this hypothesis, we will combine gain- and loss-of-
function models with state-of-the-art neural tracing and molecular profiling tools, optogenetic and
electrophysiological recordings, and comprehensive physiological assessments to delineate the
mechanisms by which VMH OGT regulates adipose tissue function and constrains body weight gain. Aim
1 will determine whether O-GlcNAc signaling in VMH neurons determines the setpoint of body weight.
Aim 2 will delineate the neurocircuitry by which OGT-expressing VMH neurons relay lipolytic information
to white adipose tissues. Aim 3 will identify how O-GlcNAc signaling regulates hormonal and nutritional
sensing of VMH neurons. A detailed understanding of body weight control by hypothalamic OGT could
support the development of novel therapies for obesity and co-morbidities."

Currently, clinical applications of intravascular catheters suffer from major challenges: 1) platelet activation and
surface-induced thrombosis, 2) biofouling of surfaces with proteins and bacteria, and 3) infection. Thrombus
formation can further lead to obstruction of blood vessels, catheter malfunction, or even life-threatening situations
such as embolism. Bacterial contamination of catheters causes more than 28,000 deaths per year in the United
States, as well as costing the healthcare industry a staggering $2.3 billion. Commercial catheters with heparin-
bonded surfaces are available to prevent clotting, but do little to prevent infections. In additions, catheters coated
with antiseptics or antibiotics decrease the risk of bacterial infection, but do not prevent biofilm formation that
shields bacteria from antibiotics. Therefore, there is a necessity and opportunity to combine strategies for
preventing thrombosis and infection into single implantable device coatings for enhanced patency and safety.
Our work and others have demonstrated that nitric oxide (NO) release from polymer surfaces can prevent platelet
activation and bacterial infection. This technology mimics the vascular endothelial cells lining the blood vessels,
as well as other cells in our bodies, producing NO locally to prevent clotting and bacterial biofilm and subsequent
infections. Recently we discovered that all of the positive effects can be achieved from polymers impregnated
with the NO donor molecule S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), which is nontoxic, inexpensive, and easy
to synthesize. Active NO release from the NO donor functionalities in the polymer reduces thrombosis and
bacterial infection polymer-blood interface; however, the NO-release strategy alone is limited by the finite
reservoir of NO donor functionalities within the polymer that limit the duration of the NO availability at the polymer-
blood interface and inability to prevent fibrin formation on the surface. Our recent work has shown the potential
of combining active NO-release with catalytic NO-generating mechanism in a single polymer. The goal of this
proposal is to develop a polymer comprised of a NO donor impregnated in the polymer to provide active
NO-release in combination with immobilized selenocystamine-heparin moieties to provide long-term NO-
generation and resist fibrin formation, resulting in a new generation of polymers that possess potent
broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties and reduce thrombosis by inhibiting platelet
adhesion/activation. The new polymers will be applicable to any blood-contacting device; however, this
proposal will focus on studying the combined NO-releasing, catalytic NO generation, and immobilized heparin
strategy in long-term (up to 30 d) intravascular catheters on clotting and infection. Successful completion of this
project will allow progression to early clinical trials and development of a new generation of catheters that can
reduce complications while improving the success of patient care."

Five years ago the AnVIL was founded with a vision of creating a federated data ecosystem. Its first phase
focused on building the foundational capabilities needed to bring together data, tools, and research
communities in a cloud-based environment. Now, in this second phase, the focus must be on scientific impact.
We will pursue the following Aims that emphasize growing the AnVIL data corpus, going multi-cloud, creating
analytical tools for flagship NHGRI initiatives, and increasing the user base. We will accomplish this through
the following Aims:
 ● Aim1 (Data Ingestion): Support the ingestion, curation, and management of diverse datasets, so
 that they are accessible to the research community. In Phase I of the AnVIL, we ingested,
 wrangled, and QC’d more than 5PB of data from NHGRI consortia. In Phase II, we will continue this
 track record of success in supporting consortia, and extend our efforts to support the long tail of
 individual researchers with valuable data to contribute to the AnVIL.
 ● Aim2 (Software Infrastructure): Reducing barriers to entry by supporting multiple clouds and
 improving cost control. While Phase I of the AnVIL focused on establishing foundational software
 infrastructure, Phase II must be about scaling adoption of the AnVIL. We have a three-part strategy for
 achieving this: (i) Becoming multi-cloud, so that we support Microsoft Azure, in additional to Google
 Cloud; (ii) Creating “AnVIL lite,” a simplified and free tier of the AnVIL that lowers barriers to entry; (iii)
 Exposing tools to improve billing visibility and prevent overspend.
 ● Aim3 (Scientific Services): Leverage the AnVIL’s datasets and platforms to accelerate scientific
 research. In Phase II, we must prioritize the scientific impact of the AnVIL. Towards this end, we will
 leverage: (i) an imputation service drawing on AnVIL datasets and other datasets of diverse ancestry;
 (ii) a newly developed genomic variant store to support joint calling; (iii) an improved and expanded
 capability for third party deployment of tools and applications in the AnVIL.
 ● Aim4 (User Services): Support the growth and long-term success of the research community
 through user support, training, and project management. The services that comprise the AnVIL are
 not only web services, but also human services. Meeting the needs of researchers everywhere requires
 security, user support, training, and project governance.
The guiding principle of our efforts is that progress in genomic data science will happen most rapidly if there is
a diversity of interoperable solutions created by a plurality of groups. Toward that end, we will continue to
ensure that the AnVIL continues to drive towards interoperability and federation by participating in NIH-led and
international efforts focused on standard setting and data sharing."

Cancer metastasis occurs when cancer cells spread to distal organs from their site of origin, and it is the
leading cause of death in patients with solid cancers. When cancer spreads to the lung, various types of innate
immune cells either help or inhibit this colonization process. Monocytes are one of the earliest cell types to
flood the lung during the beginning of metastasis. These monocytes eventually become tumor-supporting
metastasis-associated macrophages (MAMs), and many studies in the field have reported that monocytes and
MAMs actively aid metastatic cancer to infiltrate the lung and take residence there. My project aims to
understand how monocytes differentiate into MAMs; in particular, what signals and factors are critical for this
transition to occur in the lung. Furthermore, from my preliminary data, I have identified a time window during
which monocytes have undergone clear phenotypic changes but have not yet fully developed into MAMs.
Interestingly, this transition period also coincides with the anti-tumor activity of other immune cell types, such
as natural killer (NK) cells. Therefore, I aim to study the interactions between pro-tumoral monocytes and anti-
tumoral NK cells during the first several hours of cancer metastasis to the lung. By understanding how the
mechanisms that underlie these interactions help to increase the odds of metastatic establishment in the lung, I
will be able to contribute valuable insights towards novel therapeutic efforts to prevent metastasis."

 Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality (1.2 million new cases and 224,000
deaths in 2021), with most deaths occurring in children < 5 years who do not initiate treatment. These children
often present with disseminated or extrapulmonary TB as their immune systems may fail to contain their M.
tuberculosis (Mtb) infections in their lungs. Since host responses play critical roles in TB development, analysis
of Mtb- and host-derived could improve early diagnosis and TB management. However, TB tests still primarily
rely on microbiologic evidence from respiratory samples that are difficult to obtain from, and less informative for,
young children. Sputum culture detects only 30-60% of pediatric TB, and similar results are obtained with PCR-
based Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra assays. There is thus an urgent need for non-sputum-based tests that can
effectively diagnose pediatric TB and monitor its response to treatment.
 Serum biomarker assays are ideal for pediatric TB diagnosis. The assay used in our initial proposal detects
low abundance Mtb proteins in serum to effectively diagnose pediatric TB and has since received breakthrough
device status by the FDA prior to pending validation studies for its FDA clearance. We have further shown that
we can employ a nanoparticle-enhanced immunoassay (NEI) read by an inexpensive portable device to detect
Mtb-derived factors on extracellular vesicles (EVs) for TB diagnosis, an approach suitable for use in resource-
limited settings. We have also shown that a simple modification can markedly increase sensitivity and
reproducibility to improve measurements. Biomarkers on EVs secreted by Mtb-infected phagocytes and by
immune cells may reflect Mtb burden and its containment by the immune system, and provide critical information
to required improve pediatric TB diagnosis and to allow rapid and accurate assessment of effective anti-TB
treatment. However, few studies have evaluated the diagnostic and prognostic performance EV-based Mtb
assays, and none have evaluated the ability of host-derived EV biomarkers to improve assay performance.
 We now propose modify our initial NEI test to incorporate both Mtb- and host-derived EV markers associated
with TB disease in order to enhance its performance for TB diagnosis and treatment monitoring. We will employ
the following aims to develop and characterize this modified assay: 1) We will optimize its EV biomarker signature
using additional Mtb- and host-derived proteins we will identify from serum EVs of TB cases and controls. 2) We
will conduct an analytical validation of this refined NEI to establish its characteristics using STARD guidelines.
3) We will establish a prediction model of NEI array’s multiplex performance for TB diagnosis and treatment
evaluation using longitudinal serum and data from a retrospective cohort of HIV-exposed infants at increased
risk for TB (IMPAACT P1041 cohort) with longitudinal samples. 4) We will validate the NEI array’s ability to
diagnose LTBI and active TB and evaluate the efficacy of anti-TB treatment responses using longitudinal serum
from a second cohort of older children prospectively enrolled at the O&M Hospital in the Dominican Republic."

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is prevalent and costly, and associated with significant morbidity and mortality.
Effective pharmacological and psychosocial treatments for AUD exist, although many individuals do not
receive medications and most are treated via mutual support group participation. Alcoholics Anonymous and
other mutual support programs have been shown to be highly effective in supporting abstinence, and they are
a tremendously valuable option for those interested in abstinence-based recovery. Yet, approximately 80% of
individuals with AUD never seek treatment and not wanting to stop drinking is a common barrier to seeking
treatment. AA and other mutual support programs are often abstinence-based, yet programs that focus on
reductions in drinking have been shown to be as effective at reducing harms related to alcohol use. Recent
studies in population-based and clinical samples indicate significant health benefit from drinking reductions,
without total abstinence. Aligned with these findings, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism
has proposed a new operational definition of recovery defined as: remission from AUD, cessation of heavy
drinking, and improvements in functioning and well-being. Expanding the definition of recovery to include non-
abstinent outcomes could increase treatment seeking among those with AUD who are not willing to abstain but
are willing to reduce drinking, and reduce the public health burden of untreated AUD. One program that has
considerable promise for promoting AUD recovery is mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP). Efficacy
of MBRP for reducing heavy drinking has been shown in several trials. Further, MBRP explicitly targets
neurobiologically-informed domains of addiction: inhibitory control over behavioral responses (executive
function); craving and cue reactivity (incentive salience); and negative affect (negative emotionality). MBRP
may also be more effective than existing continuing care options in targeting broader health and life
functioning. MBRP also has the potential to be broadly accessible via video conferencing. The goal of this
study is to examine the effectiveness of MBRP groups delivered via video conferencing in promoting whole-
person recovery from AUD up to three years following an attempt to change or stop drinking via treatment or
self-change, as compared to referral to online mutual support groups. This study will also examine how MBRP
affects mechanisms of behavior change based on neurobiologically-informed addiction cycle domains. We will
use an effectiveness-implementation design to prospectively test the effectiveness of MBRP, as well as identify
barriers and facilitators of MBRP group participation to inform future implementation of MBRP continuing care.
The ultimate goal of this work is to evaluate MBRP via video conferencing as a continuing care option that
supports whole-person recovery and targets addiction cycle domains in supporting long-term recovery from
AUD in communities nationwide, including a focus on underserved areas. Availability of effective, evidence-
based continuing care interventions may reduce the public health burden of AUD."

 Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a major complication of cirrhosis and associated with high
mortality rate. Moreover, the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy, the current standard of care, is deteriorating
due to the global emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens. Hence, it is essential to develop novel
management strategies, for which furthering our understanding of the pathophysiology is imperative.
 Gut dysbiosis and impaired intestinal immunity in cirrhosis cooperatively predispose to the translocation of
gut flora into the mesenteric lymphatics and, subsequently, to the peritoneum. Although this mechanism has
been regarded as the primary pathophysiology, SBP develops only when the balance between peritoneal
antibacterial immunity and bacterial virulence shifts in favor of the invading pathogen.
 Peritoneal macrophage (PM) is the major cell type in the peritoneum and is considered as the first line of
antibacterial defense owing to the robust capacity in the engulfment and phagolysosomal digestion of pathogens.
Moreover, PM sensing of microbe results in the production of cytokines/chemokines required for neutrophil
recruitment and activation. Accordingly, PM is also essential for triggering the second wave of antibacterial
response. Despite its perceived importance, the role of PM in SBP has been poorly understood. Furthermore, it
remains largely elusive whether the development of cirrhosis alters the antibacterial properties of PM, and how
it impacts the overall potency of peritoneal antibacterial immunity.
 Our single cell RNA sequencing analyses of peritoneal immune cells of rat with cirrhosis demonstrate a
profound alteration of PM characteristics, including a substantial downregulation of the master regulator of PM,
GATA6, a vitamin A (VA)-inducible transcription factor. In addition, PM of cirrhotic rats exhibit a markedly reduced
capacity to produce inflammatory mediators in response to bacterial peritonitis, resulting in impaired neutrophil
recruitment and activation as well as the insufficient bacterial clearance. Our studies also reveal that two common
features of cirrhosis, VA deficiency and ascites accumulation, both independently contribute to the dysregulation
of PM antibacterial function, with both processes involving GATA6 downregulation. Moreover, PM isolated from
cirrhosis patients demonstrate a decreased number of GATA6-expressing PM, which correlates with the degree
of antibacterial function impairment. These findings led to our hypothesis: “cirrhosis impairs the antibacterial
properties of PM through the downregulation of GATA6 expression, which contributes to SBP development”.
 Accordingly, this proposal aims to close the knowledge gap regarding the role of PM in SBP through
defining: (Aim 1) the impact of cirrhosis on PM antibacterial functions, (Aim 2) the influence of VA insufficiency
on PM antibacterial properties, and (Aim 3) the effect of cirrhotic ascites on the antimicrobial activity of PM. The
successful completion of the proposed studies will result in a paradigm shift in our understanding of SBP
pathophysiology and ultimately define therapeutic targets for the development of novel therapeutic strategies."
10883648,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by
a progressive inability to control muscle movement. ALS patients are often comorbid with frontotemporal
dementia (FTD), also known as ALS/FTD. The clinical manifestation of ALS is mediated by the selective
dysfunction and degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons (MNs) that connect the CNS to the musculature.
The overwhelming majority of ALS is sporadic in nature, while 10% of patients suffer from familial forms of
disease, which have enabled the identification of causative genetic variants. ALS can be caused by mutations
in genes that encode proteins involved in diverse cellular functions ranging from RNA metabolism, proteostasis
and cytoskeletal homeostasis. Recent genetic studies have highlighted NIMA-related kinase 1 (NEK1) as a major
genetic contributor to ALS. Loss-of-function genetic variants in NEK1 confer susceptibility to ALS in as many as
2% of all cases. The specific role and function of NEK1 in the CNS remains unresolved. What also remains
elusive is the cellular mechanisms that lead to mutant NEK1 ALS pathophysiology. In the present study, we will
use NEK1 cellular models, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) patient-derived MNs, in vivo Drosophila models
and ALS-NEK1 postmortem patient CNS tissue to: a) determine the mechanisms by which ALS-associated
mutations impair MN function; b) characterize the physiological substrates for NEK1-dependent phosphorylation;
and, c) validate the contribution of these changes towards neuropathology in ALS. We will test the hypothesis
that NEK1 mutations cause neurotoxicity by disrupting the regulatory role of the kinase on cellular pathways that
are essential for MN function. In preliminary experiments, we found that NEK1-deficient iPSC-derived MNs
exhibit disrupted microtubule (MT) dynamics and impaired nuclear import. In Aim 1 we will determine whether
these defects are relevant in the context of an extensive set of nonsense and missense ALS-associated NEK1
variants. In preliminary experiments, we found that NEK1 interactors are enriched for function in the MT
cytoskeleton and nuclear import and that reduction of NEK1 levels results in differential expression of proteins
involved in these pathways. In Aim 2 we will determine the physiological substrates for NEK1 phosphorylation
in MNs by conducting phosphoproteomic mass spectrometry analysis and interrogating the functional effects of
differential phosphorylation. In preliminary experiments we identified Niki as the closest Drosophila homologue
of NEK1 and using RNAi lines we found that it is essential for motor function and survival. In Aim 3 we will
determine the function of NEK1 in the intact nervous system of flies and validate our findings on the effects of
the cellular models in vivo. Our studies will shed light into the cellular mechanisms that are compromised by
mutant NEK1 in neurons and will likely uncover potential therapeutic targets for a significant percentage of

Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) are strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of diverse aging-
associated neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia.
Mitochondria produce ROS during oxidative metabolism and increased production of mitochondrial ROS are
causally linked to various processes in AD, including aging, amyloid precursor protein/amyloid-β (APP/Aβ)
pathology, tauopathy, and neuroinflammation. Recent work suggests that ROS produced by different
mitochondrial sites have distinct roles in cell signaling and disease. However, previous tools to suppress
mitochondrial ROS were not site-selective, disrupted respiration, or inhibited ROS only after release rather than
blocking production. Thus, the roles of mitochondrial ROS in AD pathogenesis require investigation.
Mitochondrial complex III has a large capacity for ROS production and generates ROS toward the cytosol,
poising it to regulate intracellular signaling and disease mechanisms. To investigate the effects of complex III-
derived ROS, our lab has identified and characterized small molecules that suppress complex III ROS production
(S3QELs, “sequels”), but do not block ROS production by other mitochondrial sites or affect other mitochondrial
processes. In our preliminary studies using S3QELs, we found that AD-associated neuroimmune factors
enhance astrocytic complex III ROS and that complex III ROS promote JAK-STAT3 signaling and gene
expression changes linked to disease. In astrocytic-neuronal cultures, S3QELs prevented neuronal dysfunction
linked to tauopathy, but did not affect neurons cultured in isolation. In addition, S3QELs reduced neuroimmune
and glial alterations in mice expressing mutant human tau. These data implicate complex III ROS in astrocytic
signaling and AD-related cascades. I propose to test my central hypotheses that astrocytic complex III ROS are
increased by specific disease-related stimuli and modulate astrocytic functions and dementia-linked pathogenic
processes through oxidation of distinct cysteine targets, including those related to STAT3. In Aim 1, I will use a
genetically-encoded ratiometric H2O2 sensor targeted to specific subcellular compartments in primary mouse
and human iPSC-derived astrocytes to define the exact patterns and upstream triggers of astrocytic complex III
ROS. I will also use genetic and pharmacological tools to determine the roles of complex III ROS in astrocytic
signaling, gene expression, and astrocytic-neuronal interactions. In Aim 2, I will use innovative redox proteomics
methods to broadly profile complex III ROS-mediated cysteine oxidation and use targeted and cell-specific
genetic manipulations to assess how oxidation of specific cysteine sites alters astrocytic signaling and
pathological cascades linked to dementia. The proposed study is likely to elucidate novel oxidative mechanisms
that regulate glial signaling and disease cascades and could lead to the development of targeted and effective
therapies for aging-related dementias."

Germline immortality is essential for species survival. Evidence from plants to animals suggests germline
immortality depends on small RNA pathways that promote genome stability. In Caenorhabditis elegans germline,
small RNAs that interact with the PIWI Argonaute protein PRG-1—called piRNAs—initiate silencing of foreign
sequences that is then maintained by Worm Argonautes (WAGOs). Nuclear WAGO-9 binds the nucleosome
remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex via histone deacetylase (HDA-1), which initiates heterochromatin
formation on piRNA targets. piRNA pathway defects activate expression of foreign sequences and disrupt germ
cell development and fertility. How collaboration between the piRNA pathway and heterochromatin machinery is
regulated to promote germline immortality is unclear.
In the C. elegans germline, assembly of HDA-1 into the NuRD complex depends on the small ubiquitin-like
modifier (SUMO). In worms expressing mutant HDA-1 that cannot be SUMOylated, piRNA-mediated silencing,
germline heterochromatin formation, and fertility are lost. Interestingly, HDA-1 SUMOylation is not needed for its
assembly into the NuRD complex in somatic embryo. Together, these findings suggest that the piRNA pathway
relies on SUMO to co-opt NuRD complex assembly in the germline for silencing of piRNA targets.
This proposal seeks to explore how germline NuRD complex assembly and its recruitment by the piRNA pathway
are regulated. Aim 1 will explore the role of SUMOylated and germline-specific factors in preventing default
(SUMO independent) assembly of the NuRD complex in germline. The highly-conserved MRG-1 chromodomain
protein is essential for piRNA-mediated silencing and is SUMOylated. Preliminary data suggest SUMOylated
MRG-1 in germline renders HDA-1 function to be SUMO-dependent. Co-immunoprecipitation assays will be
used to determine whether SUMOylated MRG-1 prevents unmodified HDA-1 from assembling into the germline
NuRD complex. Because SUMOylated MRG-1 is abundant in embryonic tissue, this aim will also use mass
spectrometry and immunofluorescence assays to identify potential germline-specific factors interacting with
SUMOylated MRG-1 to render germline HDA-1 function SUMO dependent. Aim 2 will determine whether HDA-
1 SUMOylation promotes interaction with WAGO-9. Putative SUMO-interacting motifs of WAGO-9 will be
mutated and the effect on piRNA-mediated silencing and HDA-1interaction will be determined. This aim will also
computationally analyze published data characterizing strength of piRNA-target interactions to explore how the
piRNA pathway may utilize its targeting of transcripts to enact downstream silencing via heterochromatin. This
work will reveal how highly conserved small RNA and chromatin factors coordinate to promote germline
immortality, and provide the fellow with training in genetics, microscopy, biochemistry, and bioinformatics to
prepare them for a future career as an independent investigator."

The objective of the proposed study is to examine the bidirectional associations between alcohol use and
intimate partner violence (IPV) during the developmental period from adolescence to young adulthood, when
both alcohol use and IPV peak. Furthermore, the developmental period from adolescence to young adulthood
often brings mental health challenges, such as symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress, which can
coincide with alcohol use and IPV. Thus, the present study aims to investigate the bidirectional associations
between alcohol use and IPV across eleven years from adolescence (age 15) to young adulthood (age 26),
and whether symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress moderate the relationship between alcohol use
and IPV. To date, studies examining the bidirectional associations between alcohol use and IPV have not been
situated during this critical developmental period. Therefore, the current proposal can provide critical
information on timing and vulnerability factors (e.g., depression or post-traumatic stress symptoms) to inform
alcohol-related IPV prevention and intervention efforts. Furthermore, research is lacking on how the
relationship between alcohol use and IPV may differ as a function of sex assigned at birth, race, and ethnicity,
despite some evidence that patterns of alcohol use and IPV differ amongst these groups. Thus, the current
proposal will explore differences in the relationship between alcohol use and IPV as a function of intersecting
demographic identities. This project will inform future research aimed at designing culturally-affirming IPV
prevention and intervention programs."
10909854,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The mitochondrial protein sulfite oxidase (SUOX) has surprisingly emerged as a potential regulator of ribosome
biogenesis in a genome-wide screen. Ribosome biogenesis, which occurs in the nucleolus of eukaryotic cells,
is a highly regulated process essential for cell function. Despite its importance and relevance to diseases such
as cancer and ribosomopathies, the regulation of ribosome biogenesis in human cells is not fully understood.
To identify novel regulators of this process, the Baserga laboratory pioneered a genome-wide siRNA screen
using the number of nucleoli per nucleus as an endpoint. MCF10A breast epithelial cells have an average
nucleolar number of 2-3, and a decrease to one indicates aberrant ribosome biogenesis. SUOX is a
mitochondrial protein that has unexpectedly surfaced as a hit from this screen. SUOX oxidizes toxic cellular
sulfite to sulfate, and some SUOX variants are known to cause the severe, fatal developmental disease
Isolated Sulfite Oxidase Deficiency (ISOD). Validation shows that SUOX depletion reduces nucleolar number
and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) biogenesis. I have collected further data demonstrating ribosome biogenesis
disruption upon SUOX depletion, and proteomics data strongly supporting a role for SUOX in making
ribosomes. The similarity of the presentation of ISOD to that of known ribosomopathies, along with our
intriguing preliminary results, has raised compelling questions about the involvement of ribosome biogenesis in
ISOD pathogenesis. Drilling down to the mechanistic level, our preliminary metabolomics data reveal that
SUOX depletion causes a decrease in the methyl donor required for the nucleolar methyltransferase fibrillarin.
Fibrillarin methylates an rDNA-specific histone and rRNA, regulating rDNA transcription and rRNA processing,
respectively. To date, no work has investigated the role of SUOX in ribosome biogenesis nor of ribosome
biogenesis in ISOD pathogenesis. In Aim 1, I will establish the precise role of SUOX in ribosome biogenesis,
taking advantage of established assays measuring multiple stages of the process. I will describe effects of
SUOX depletion on rRNA methylation using the recently developed RibOxi-seq method, and histone
methylation using established antibodies. I will further validate our results using the auxin-inducible degron
version 2 (AID2) system. In Aim 2, I will determine the effects of disease-associated SUOX variants on human
ribosome biogenesis by rescuing the defects that occur upon siRNA-mediated SUOX depletion with
translationally silent and disease-associated loss-of-function SUOX variants. The experiments proposed will
clearly define a role for SUOX in human ribosome biogenesis and describe the effects of known disease-
causing variants on this essential cellular process. Our unique approach based on an unbiased screen for
nucleolar function, combined with both well-established and novel methodology to study ribosome biogenesis,
gives us the opportunity to take the field of SUOX research in an entirely new direction that will open avenues
for understanding the function of SUOX in cellular metabolism and human genetic disease."
10768779,"Title: Leveraging human evolutionary history to improve our fundamental understanding
of complex disease architecture
Abstract: The overarching goal of this research is to improve the applicability of genetic risk
predictions within and across human populations by leveraging recent advances in our
understanding of human evolutionary history. In Aim 1, I will carry out empirically-guided
simulations to investigate how fine-scale substructure in large genome-wide association studies
(GWAS; e.g. UK Biobank) biases our inference of complex trait architecture and polygenic risk
score prediction. I will leverage these findings to develop statistical and computational tools to
correct for such biases. In Aim 2, I will investigate whether recent admixture in humans generates
incompatibilities between mitochondrial and nuclear DNA in African Americans. To test this, I will
analyze genetic and electronic health record data from the ethnically diverse Penn Medicine
Biobank to test whether mito-nuclear discordance—degree of ancestry divergence between
mitochondrial and nuclear genomes—is associated with the risk of diseases common among
African Americans. Additionally, I will test for selection against mito-nuclear incompatibilities in
recently admixed populations. In Aim 3, I will investigate how the practice of endogamy and
consanguinity among Pakistanis shapes their disease risk architecture. I will further evaluate the
ability and limitations of currently used GWAS methods, which are typically modeled after outbred
populations, to infer disease architecture given the complex population structure in Pakistanis. I
will improve upon these methods, thereby making GWAS more widely applicable to a diverse set
of people. Each of my three aims is independent, yet together they will lead to improvements in
diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of human diseases—the overarching mission of the NIGMS.
I will learn the skills needed to accomplish these aims with the help of my advisory committee,
comprising of Drs. Iain Mathieson, Sarah Tishkoff, Doug Wallace, and Marilyn Ritchie, who are
world-class leaders in genetics research. With the training plan that I have outlined and the
resources at the University of Pennsylvania, I am confident that the K99 award will help me
achieve my goal of becoming an independent scientist in the field of statistical genetics."
10752656,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) is a cell-biological process that drives the metastatic
dissemination of tumor cells and results in invasiveness, acquisition of tumor-initiating properties and
elevated resistance to treatment regimes. Using novel in vivo models of epithelial and mesenchymal
breast carcinomas, I have demonstrated that epithelial tumors are heavily infiltrated with biologically
active CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells, and contain low levels of immunosuppressive Tregs. In contrast, the
more mesenchymal tumors exclude exhausted, CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells and recruit immunosuppressive
Tregs and pro-tumor, M2-like macrophages instead. Most importantly, epithelial tumors are largely
sensitive to anti-CTLA4 immunotherapy, whereas the mesenchymal tumors are resistant. These
findings suggest that mesenchymal breast carcinomas assemble an immunosuppressive tumor
microenvironment (TME) and mount refractory responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB).
However, the precise mechanism(s) by which this occurs is unclear. Whether mesenchymal carcinoma
cells express cell-intrinsic immunosuppressive factors that directly regulate the refractory responses of
mesenchymal tumors to ICB is not known. For this reason, one goal of this proposal is to determine the
identity and function of mesenchymal carcinoma cell-intrinsic factors in regulating immunosuppression
and refractory responses to ICB. While my data demonstrate that only the tumors arising from
mesenchymal, but not epithelial cell lines are enriched in immunosuppressive cells, the functional
significance of these distinct subsets is unknown. Thus, another goal of this proposal is to determine
whether immune infiltrates themselves are involved in the induction and/or maintenance of an
immunosuppressive TME in the mesenchymal tumors. In addition to the aforementioned results, I made
the striking observation that a small minority (~10%) of more mesenchymal cells could largely protect a
majority (90%) of commingled epithelial carcinoma cells from elimination by anti-CTLA4. Thus, not only
are mesenchymal carcinoma cells immunosuppressive, but they also protect their epithelial neighbors
from immune attack. However, whether they do so by exerting immunosuppressive forces in a systemic
(endocrine) fashion or localized (paracrine) fashion is unclear. Hence the final goal of this proposal is to
explore how mesenchymal carcinoma cells protect epithelial cells residing within the same tumor from
immune attack. The work proposed in this proposal is likely to uncover the molecular players and
cellular subsets involved in inducing EMT-mediated immunosuppression. This study is expected to
have an important positive impact through identifying novel diagnostic and prognostic markers of breast
carcinomas that could potentially be used for immunotherapeutic intervention as well."
10752661,"Our goal is to continue to advance the successful, multidisciplinary research agenda of the Antibacterial
Resistance Leadership Group (ARLG). In the original award period, the ARLG agenda increased scientific
knowledge of antibacterial resistance and sought to mitigate important factors that drive its expansion. We
continue to pair an unprecedented team of over two dozen of the world's top investigators with the
organizational excellence of the Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI), one of the world's largest Academic
Research Organizations. Because of the complexity of integrating multiple components of such a large-scale
clinical research network, our renewal continues to feature centralized leadership through an Executive
Committee and a dual PI approach. One PI (Fowler) focuses primarily on operations and the other (Chambers)
focuses largely on scientific agenda. The organizational structure also features Scientific Subcommittees
devoted to three priority areas: Gram-negative bacterial infections, Gram-positive bacterial infections, and
Diagnostics. These Subcommittees are supported by internationally recognized Collaborating Investigators to
advance four core value areas: 1) Scientific Expertise; 2) Innovations; 3) Mentoring and Diversity; and 4)
Network Development. To complement the ongoing research activities of both the diagnostic and the
pharmaceutical industries, our ARLG has established collaborative ties with members of both communities.
Our long-term research goal is to improve outcomes of multiple-drug resistant (MDR) bacterial infections by
designing and conducting transformational diagnostic and therapeutic clinical trials. Our research portfolio will
pursue this goal in therapeutics by conducting first-in kind strategy trials in MDR Gram-negative bacteria and
MRSA and by studying nontraditional therapeutics (monoclonal antibodies and bacteriophages) against MDR
Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We will pursue this goal in diagnostics by obtaining FDA approval for a host gene
expression-based diagnostic and by evaluating the clinical impact of rapid phenotypic testing in patients with
bloodstream infection. Our research agenda reflects a realistic strategy of incremental steps towards complex
practice-changing trials. Our Specific Aims are to 1) To maintain a Scientific Leadership Center (SLC) that
provides overall scientific and administrative leadership for the network; 2) To maintain a Clinical Operations
Center (COC) that provides operational support, management, and oversight for the network’s clinical studies
and trials; 3) To maintain a Laboratory Center (LC) that advances the ARLG research agenda by leading the
development, implementation, and evaluation of essential laboratory research; and 4): To maintain a Statistics
and Data Management Center (SDMC) that advances the ARLG research agenda by providing leadership in

RUNX1 is the DNA-binding subunit of the core binding factor (CBF) complex and a master-regulator
transcription factor, which is involved in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Somatic, heterozygous RUNX1
mutations commonly occur in Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) (10%), as well as in secondary (s) or de novo
AML (~10%). Germline mutations in RUNX1 cause the highly penetrant (~40%) autosomal dominant, Familial
Platelet Disorder (FPD), which can evolve into myeloid malignancy (FPD-MM). Majority of mutant (mt) RUNX1
behave mostly as loss of function mutations, conferring relative therapy-resistance and poorer survival in
patients with AML. Consequently, there is a strong unmet need to develop novel therapies for AML expressing
somatic or germline mtRUNX1. Our preliminary studies have demonstrated for the first time that shRNA-
mediated knockdown of RUNX1 (mutant and wild-type) or disruption of its binding to CBFβ induces greater
lethality in AML progenitor cells (HPCs) expressing mtRUNX1 compared to wild-type (wt) RUNX1. We also
found that the +24kb enhancer (eR1) within the intragenic super-enhancer (SE) of RUNX1 regulates its
transcription in AML cells. The chromatin reader BET (Bromodomain Extra-terminal) protein (BETP) BRD4
promotes transcription of RUNX1 and its targets. BRD4 degradation or eviction from chromatin, or gene-editing
of the +24kb RUNX1 eR1, induces lethality in AML cells. By determining and utilizing the mRNA signature from
RUNX1-depleted (by shRNA) AML cells, we queried, through LINCS1000-CMap (Connectivity Mapping)
analysis, for expression mimickers (EMs). We identified novel EMs that repress RUNX1 and its targets and
induce significantly more apoptosis of AML cells expressing mtRUNX1 versus wtRUNX1. Therefore, the
hypothesis motivating our studies is that knocking down of levels of RUNX1 and its targets will induce lethality
not only in AML blasts expressing somatic mtRUNX1 but also in FPD/MM HPCs expressing germline
mtRUNX1. The specific aims of studies proposed are: AIM 1: To determine impact on active enhancers,
transcriptome and pre-clinical in vitro and in vivo efficacy of BETP antagonist along with its co-repression of
RUNX1, BCL2 and CDK6, alone or in combination with BCL2 or CDK6 inhibitor, in AML blasts and patient-
derived xenograft (PDX) models expressing somatic mutant RUNX1. Additionally, we will evaluate pre-clinical
efficacy of co-targeting CRISPR-Cas9 screen-discovered top ‘druggable’ dependencies along with BETP
antagonist against AML blasts expressing somatic mtRUNX1. AIM 2: To elucidate pre-clinical in vitro and in
vivo efficacy of the EMs homoharringtonine (omacetaxine) or fedratinib alone and in combination with BETP
antagonists against patient-derived AML blasts and PDX models expressing somatic mtRUNX1. AIM 3: To
determine pre-clinical in vitro and in vivo efficacy of selected EMs that repress RUNX1 and its targets against
patient-derived HPCs from FPD-MM expressing germline mtRUNX1 and other somatic co-mutations versus
HPCs from RUNX1-FPD expressing only germline mtRUNX1."

 Redox imbalances of reactive sulfur species (RSS) in cardiac cells contribute to
cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI/R) injury and heart failure.
Applications of sulfane sulfurs have been found to cause cardioprotective effects, and sulfane
sulfur bioavailability in plasma has even been recently suggested to be a biomarker for
cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, this field currently lacks clear understandings as to how
endogenous RSS, particularly sulfane sulfurs, work. Our long-term goal is to elucidate the
complex sulfane sulfur pathways at various health stages of cardiac cells and use this information
to drive the development of early diagnostic tools and therapies for CVD. Specifically, this project
will meet the critical need of having effective methods to study these pathways by developing
chemical tools that: 1) quantifiably ‘see into cells/tissues’ despite the presence of biological fluids
such as blood and 2) turn-on only after subcellular localization. These highly sensitive, specific,
and targetable/triggerable next generation fluorescent sensors will allow us to probe the
cardioprotective roles of sulfane sulfurs in cardiac cell models of MI/R injury even to subcellular
extents and non-invasively decipher complex cardiovascular sulfur-mediated redox pathways. We
expect that: 1) promising sensors will be identified for future evaluations in animal models of MI/R
and 2) our tools and studies will establish a strong basis for advancing the clinical potential of
sulfane sulfurs through a greater understanding of the mechanisms by which sulfane sulfurs
regulate redox environments in CVD. The long-term goal for this fellowship award is to develop
essential skills for a successful career as a chemical biology professor studying human diseases
at an R1 institution. A team consisting of the sponsor and collaborators has been assembled with
expertise in organic chemistry and synthesis, redox biology, chemical biology, molecular and cell
biology, computational/data sciences, and cardiovascular diseases. Further training will be
obtained from conference attendance and presentations in conjunction with teaching certificate

Air pollution is a major environmental health threat and is associated with several adverse health outcomes in
children and adolescents including asthma, obesity, and childhood cancer. Growing evidence indicates that air
pollutants, including particulate matter (PM), can also negatively affect brain development and increase risk of
poor mental health outcomes. Indeed, recent work has shown that exposure to air pollution, specifically PM2.5
(PM with an aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 μm) is associated with both the prevalence and severity of anxiety
disorders in youth. Further, anxiety disorders commonly begin during adolescence and early-onset (vs. adult-
onset) is associated with poor long-term outcomes, including more chronic disease and poorer treatment
response. However, the neurodevelopmental mechanisms underlying environmental risk of anxiety are
unknown. The proposed F32 will be the first to test the novel hypothesis that adolescents exposed to higher
recent PM2.5 concentrations will exhibit poor fear extinction recall, lower frontolimbic activation, and higher anxiety
symptoms. This project builds on prior research demonstrating that impaired fear extinction and frontolimbic
dysfunction are neurodevelopmental markers of anxiety disorders, and our recent and preliminary data show
that fear regulation and frontolimbic circuitry (i.e., hippocampus, ventromedial prefrontal cortex) develop during
early adolescence and are sensitive to environmental insults (e.g., traumatic stress). Further, emerging
preclinical and human neuroimaging studies suggest that fear-related learning and frontolimbic brain regions are
susceptible to PM2.5 exposure, particularly during adolescence, a period of psychiatric vulnerability. The
proposed study will recruit adolescents exposed to recent PM2.5 concentrations, estimated using state-of-the-art
high resolution (0.74 km2) spatiotemporal models developed by Co-Sponsor Brokamp. Participants will complete
a two-day fear extinction functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment developed and validated by
Sponsor Marusak to probe fear regulation and frontolimbic circuitry. This paradigm uses virtual reality coupled
with psychophysiological recordings and neuroimaging. This fellowship study provides an important first step
towards identifying neurodevelopmental mechanisms underlying environmental risk of psychopathology, and will
inform targeted early interventions to stem the etiology of anxiety in at-risk pollution-exposed youth. With key
training in environmental impacts on brain development, psychophysiology and fMRI, and the neurobiology of
pediatric anxiety, this project is ideally suited for the F32 mechanism. This project is supported by a team of
mentors with complementary expertise, including Sponsor Marusak and Co-Sponsors Jovanovic, Ryan, Strawn,
and Brokamp. This training project will provide PI Zundel with the critical data and training needed to expand on
this work longitudinally, evaluating developmental trajectories in pollution-exposed youth. It will also prepare PI
Zundel for a career committed to uncovering neurodevelopmental mechanisms contributing to environmental
risk of neuropsychiatric disease."
11013303,"Project Summary. Youths receiving mental healthcare often have multiple disorders, distinctive treatment-
relevant personal and family characteristics, and problems that may shift during treatment. For these youths,
modular psychotherapies, in which providers select from a menu of therapeutic elements to build personalized
treatments, may be especially appropriate. One well-studied modular youth psychotherapy is Modular
Approach to Therapy for Children with Anxiety, Depression, Trauma, or Conduct Problems (MATCH). In some
trials with intensive, one-on-one expert support for element selection, MATCH significantly outperformed usual
care and evidence-based standardized psychotherapies; but in trials with less intensive (more practically
feasible) support, MATCH did not outperform usual care. This discrepancy highlights a key challenge of
MATCH and other modular psychotherapies: selection of treatment elements. Because MATCH allows any
number of sessions implemented in any order, a virtually unlimited array of treatment element sequences could
be selected. This flexibility supports personalization but may also impact the effectiveness of MATCH and
other modular psychotherapies, because it can be unclear which modules should be used when. As in other
modular therapies, clinicians using MATCH are asked to use clinical judgment and are provided with decision-
making guidance based on past literature and client weekly assessments. But research has shown that
statistical decision-making models using archival data very often outperform clinician judgment. Currently, no
modular youth psychotherapies employ data-driven statistical models to inform decision-making. This is
understandable: no such models are currently available. The proposed study will be an initial step toward filling
this gap; it will use statistical models of archival treatment data to provide decision-making guidance in modular
youth psychotherapy, aimed at enhancing its efficiency and effectiveness. Per NIMH Priority 3.2, the proposed
project will inform “tailoring existing interventions to optimize outcomes” by “reanalyzing… aggregated clinical
trials” using “computational approaches… to facilitate clinical decision-making”. Specifically, the project will
aggregate data from six MATCH trials (N=602, ages 6-15), to: model short-term between-person and within-
person associations between use of each treatment element and subsequent symptom change at different
stages of treatment (Aim 1); use statistical learning to identify moderators of these associations between
elements and subsequent symptoms (Aim 2); and, in a holdout sample, test whether agreement between the
model recommendations and youths’ treatment course predicts long-term treatment outcomes (Aim 3). To
inform future development of clinical decision guidance tools (after the F31), clinicians will be interviewed about
how model-based findings might be used in clinical practice (Exploratory Aim 4). Ultimately, consistent with
NIMH priorities, this work may inform clinical decision making in youth psychotherapy in several data-driven
ways, with the goal of eventually enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of modular youth psychotherapies."

Narrowing of critical blood vessels due to thrombosis or embolism is one of the most prevalent heart valve
diseases and the leading cause of death with aging. Their hemodynamic environment significantly changes as
a result, with an increase in shear stress up to >1000 dyne/cm2 in highly constricted vessels compared to 1–70
dyne/cm2 in normal vessels. Since the increased shear stress activates platelets, the vessels become even more
narrow at the stenotic site from the platelet aggregation, leading to a life-threatening stroke or long-term disability.
The current treatment for obstructed vessels is to administer thrombolytic or anticoagulant drugs, but it entails
high bleeding risk as active drugs are distributed throughout the body. Thus, to overcome current limitations, the
goal of this proposal is to develop a synthetic cell system that only releases drugs in constricted vessels where
it exhibits abnormally high shear stress. A synthetic cell is a bilayer membrane structure (e.g., vesicle) that
includes various biomolecules to carry out cell-like behaviors. They are gaining attention in the drug delivery field
as they can present sense-responsive behavior towards the surrounding environment when engineered with
membrane proteins. To develop a shear stress-responsive synthetic cell that can be used for targeted drug
delivery in stenotic blood vessels, we will use the most well-studied bacterial mechanosensitive channels, the
mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL). MscL is a non-selective channel that opens upon an
increase in membrane tension. Our lab is the first group, to our knowledge, to develop synthetic cells using MscL
and successfully demonstrate their function under hypo-osmotic condition. Recent theoretical studies have
shown that the MscL reconstituted in vesicles can also be activated by shear stress when flowing through a
narrowing constriction channel. Our hypothesis is that MscL incorporated in vesicles will be opened under shear
stress by vesicle-shape deformation-driven membrane stretch and release the loaded drugs. We will investigate
MscL activity under shear stress using constricted microfluidic channels in Aim 1. Contributing factors, such as
vesicle size and lipid compositions, will be tuned to understand their effects on MscL response. In Aim 2, we will
examine the potential value of the system in vitro. We will introduce thrombolytic drug-loaded synthetic cells into
microfluidic channels that are constricted with experimentally induced fibrin emboli and monitor the dissolution
of the clots. Successful completion of this work will result in the development of shear stress-responsive synthetic
cells that can locally release thrombolytic or anticoagulant drugs in constricted or stenotic vessels. This work will
further expand the application boundary of the synthetic cell field by utilizing mechanical stimulus-responsive
synthetic cells as drug carriers. Additionally, successful activation of MscL under shear stress will provide a
deeper understanding of MscL and demonstrates this channel's effectiveness in the drug delivery field as a drug-
releasing valve in more diverse contexts."
10909351,"Sarcopenia, or loss of skeletal muscle mass, with impaired contractile function that causes physical frailty and
decreased exercise capacity are frequent in cirrhosis and contribute to adverse clinical outcomes. Exercise
training improves some measures of muscle mass and exercise capacity but the mechanistic basis of these
responses in cirrhosis is not known. In healthy subjects, endurance exercise (EE) improves maximum oxygen
consumption (VO2max) while resistance exercise (RE) increases muscle mass and strength. In patients with
cirrhosis, an increase in muscle mass improves survival. In contrast, higher VO2max is associated with better
survival but whether an increase in VO2max translates to improved clinical outcomes in cirrhosis is not known.
Low adherence to prescribed exercise training is another challenge in patients with cirrhosis and home-based,
unsupervised programs are not consistently effective. Changes in gut microbiome and microbial metabolites
(xenometabolites) occur with exercise in healthy subjects, but whether exercise causes changes in the gut
microbiome/metabolites in cirrhosis and if the changes can be related to skeletal muscle anabolic responses
are also not known. In preliminary studies, we noted that ammonia, a xenometabolite that is increased in the
plasma and skeletal muscle in patients with cirrhosis, causes sarcopenia in preclinical models. In the proposed
studies, we will integrate hypothesis- and data-driven approaches to identify the molecular and metabolic
responses to an exercise training program in patients with cirrhosis to reverse sarcopenia. We will test the
overall hypothesis that a supervised, structured endurance or resistance exercise will result in
improvement in skeletal muscle molecular, metabolic and functional perturbations in cirrhosis. In AIM
1, the molecular and metabolic responses to exercise training in well-characterized, stable patients with
cirrhosis will be determined. Patients will be randomized to a home-based, telemedicine supervised EE or RE
program or standard of care (SOC) management for 12 weeks. Muscle mass, measures of physical frailty,
muscle protein synthesis, mitochondrial function and cellular signaling responses will be quantified. Patients
will be followed for 6-months after completion of the exercise program for mortality, decompensation, and
hospitalization. These first-in-class studies will evaluate the efficacy of a supervised, personalized training
program in patients with cirrhosis. In AIM 2, global multiomics responses will be compared between EE, RE
and SOC. Skeletal muscle transcriptome, proteome, phosphoproteome, metabolome; plasma
proteome/metabolome; and stool microbiome/metabolome will be quantified. An integrated multiomics
approach including functional enrichment analyses will be performed using machine learning algorithms to
relate the muscle and plasma responses to alterations in microbiome in cirrhosis. These studies will
simultaneously help address the mechanistic basis of responses to EE or RE while enhancing compliance in
patients with cirrhosis to develop targeted and personalized training programs."

 Major gaps remain in our knowledge of how transcription factors (TFs) interact to bind target
cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and dictate gene expression during development. There are ~1600 TFs in
vertebrates, and therefore traditional approaches of genetic screens with TF pairwise knockouts would require
>2.5 million experiments. Even with high throughput methods, this is not experimentally feasible. I will build
novel computational tools and deep neural networks and use multiplexed high-throughput single-cell Assay for
Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (scATAC-seq) data from zebrafish throughout development. These deep
neural networks will be used for in silico experiments to model CRE interactions to learn the cell-type
specific regulatory syntax of T-box proteins during development. These combinations of TF-TF
interactions from in silico experiments will then be tested with targeted CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis followed by
phenotype profiling with in situ hybridization and high-throughput low-cost scATAC and scRNA-seq.
 In Aim 1, I will make a genome-wide cis-regulatory map of cell-type specific gene regulation of
zebrafish to uncover the role of Nodal signaling in zebrafish somitic mesoderm development. In zebrafish,
mutations to Nodal, a ligand to TGF-Beta receptor proteins, cause a phenotype of aberrantly undifferentiated
trunk somitic mesoderm and correctly differentiated tail somitic mesoderm. The mechanisms driving the
differences between these somites are unknown. To resolve this mystery, I will generate single-cell time series
wild-type and Nodal deficient embryos across the continuum of zebrafish development using multiplexed
high-throughput scATACseq and scRNAseq data. Computationally linking these data will represent a
comprehensive reference of zebrafish CRE and transcriptional development and a valuable resource for all
zebrafish biologists. By improving the software package, Cicero, to include flexible Poisson lognormal network
models, we can achieve the resolution necessary to find novel cell-type specific differences in
enhancer-promoter links during development and perturbationc
 In Aims 2, I will train and validate a deep learning neural network model to predict pairs of transcription
factors that interact to activate cell-type specific gene programs. I will use these data and computational
tools to perform in silico experiments to learn the cell-type specific regulatory syntax of T-box TFs
during development. After performing in silico experiments using this neural network, I will rank candidate
TF-TF interactions to test using high-throughput methods for targeted CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis to knock out
TFs. I will apply this method to uncover the cis-regulatory syntax that allows T-box family transcription factors
to exert their DNA loci specificity."
10914659,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Sex difference in the profile of extracellular bioactive lipid mediators, especially that of the specialized
pro-resolving and proinflammatory lipid mediators (SPMs and PIMs, respectively), during inflammation is
significantly correlated to sex differences in the cellular response, and prevalence and the severity of various
inflammatory diseases, including ocular surface inflammation.
 As an ocular surface tissue, conjunctival epithelium lines the inside of the eyelids and covers the sclera,
thus providing stability to the anterior segment of the eye. The conjunctival goblet cells (CGCs) secrete mucins
to wet and protect the ocular surface, of which under- or over-secretion due to inflammation causes visual
disturbance. Therefore, time-dependent resolution of conjunctival inflammation is critical for a transparent cornea
and clear vision.
 Our exciting preliminary data show that CGCs secrete SPMs and PIMs as extracellular vesicle (EV) cargo
to maintain homeostasis, and the amount of SPMs dramatically increases during a histamine-mediated allergic
response. Interestingly, the increase was only observed in EVs of female CGCs but not males. EVs collected
from males under the same condition showed a slight decrease in the amounts of SPMs compared to the control.
 To further investigate these novel findings, this research proposal aims to study the sex differences in
the cellular response of human CGCs and the bioactive lipid mediators that CGCs secrete via EVs during
histamine-mediated allergic inflammation. For Aim 1, we will identify sex differences in the cellular response by
quantifying the magnitude of mucin secretion and change in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, and measuring the
activation of intracellular enzymes involved in the allergic response and synthesis of bioactive lipid mediators.
For Aim 2, we will determine the sex differences in the profile of extracellular bioactive lipid mediators during the
allergic response by analyzing the type and amount of SPMs and PIMs loaded into EVs, and their time course
of secretion.
 The success of this study will provide new insights into the bioactive lipid-mediated ocular surface
protective mechanism generated by the conjunctiva and the basis for a tailored sex-dependent, lipid-based
therapeutic approach in the management of vision-debilitating ocular surface diseases."
10837028,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease with a prevalence of over 5
cases per 100,000 people. People with ALS (PALS) typically develop bulbar motor symptoms throughout the
course of the disease, often leading to dysarthria, a neuromotor disorder of speech execution. Dysarthria
interferes with successful communicative interactions by reducing intelligibility, increasing the effort required by
listeners to understand the speech signal, and reducing speech naturalness. Gaps in our understanding of the
underlying speech production factors contributing to communicative participation are significant barriers to
identifying treatment targets, identifying the onset of communicative participation restrictions, and monitoring
progress. To address these gaps, a better understanding of the acoustic and perceptual attributes of dysarthria
that degrade communicative participation is critical. The purpose of this project is to identify causal links
between speech acoustic features, perceptual speech features, and communicative participation. In Aim 1, we
test the hypothesis that listener effort and speech naturalness will be strongly associated with communicative
participation using bivariate correlations and multiple linear regression. In Aim 2, we test the hypotheses that
(1) acoustic features related to speech clarity will be strongly associated with listener effort, and (2) that
acoustic features representing prosody will be strongly associated with speech naturalness, using bivariate
correlations and multiple linear regression. In Aim 3, we test the hypothesis that speech acoustics will predict
communicative participation and that this relationship will be primarily mediated through clinical impressions of
listener effort and speech naturalness using a mediation analysis. The long-term goal of the proposed research
is to maximize communicative participation, and thereby improve the quality of life of PALS. Results will inform
treatment by (1) guiding the use of evidence-based clinical tools (e.g., listener effort and naturalness rating
scales) that are associated with communicative participation for assessment and monitoring, and (2) identifying
specific treatment (e.g., articulatory precision, speech prosody) targets to support communicative participation.
This project falls under NIDCD’s Priority Area 3 in Voice, Speech, and Language Research, as it investigates a
causal framework that could support diagnosis, treatment, and progress monitoring in individuals with speech
impairments. Furthermore, this work is in line with NIDCD’s mission to further our knowledge and
understanding of communication disorders."
10747975,"In this grant, we propose to understand the molecular mechanisms of dendrite
morphogenesis and function. Dendrite morphogenesis determines the connectivity of
neurons. We are using a model cell (PVD in C elegans) to study this question. PVD is a
proprioceptive neuron that senses muscle contraction and regulates animal movement.
In our previous work, we identified the extracellular ligands and their receptor on PVD
that guide the dendrite growth and branching. Here, we propose to understand how the
receptor-ligand interaction triggers signaling mechanisms and leads to cytoskeletal
modifications which eventually drives the morphogenesis events. We will also study how
the neurons regulate receptor signaling using a drug target protein called KPC-1 to
control guidance decisions. We will also understand how the PVD neurons sense
muscle contraction using a putative mechanosensitive channel and how it regulates
neuromuscular activity through a surprising neural circuit feedback mechanism.
Through these experiments, we will gain insights in the molecular logic of dendrite
development. We will identify novel mechanosensitive channels that are important for
body movement regulation."

10749926,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The CGIBD Gnotobiotic Core, an integral Center component since 1988, is a highly utilized resource that
provides CGIBD members with germ-free (sterile), selectively colonized and fecal transplanted mice to
precisely study host-environmental interactions and bacterial functions. This world-class facility allows CGIBD
members, their trainees and collaborators to perform cutting edge investigations using wild-type (WT) and
genetically engineered transgenic, knockout and reporter gnotobiotic mice in the absence of microbiota [germ-
free (GF)] or colonized with single bacterial species, including gene deletion/complemented mutants, defined
consortia of murine or human bacterial species or transfer complex fecal microbial communities from
experimental mice or humans (microbiologically humanized mice) with dysbiosis to study disease
pathogenesis. The two Gnotobiotic Core branches, one at UNC-Chapel Hill and the other at the NC State
University College of Veterinary Medicine provide GF or gnotobiotic mice and associated technical services, to
CGIBD members, associate members, and new investigators at each location. We maintain 28 GF mouse
strains and lines, including WT, knockout, transgenic, and reporter mice. The specific aims of the Core are: 1)
Provide GF or selectively colonized (gnotobiotic) WT and mutant mice, their tissues and cells. 2) Derive
additional GF WT and genetically engineered mouse strains. 3) Consult with investigators to optimize

10749929,"ADVANCED ANALYTICS CORE
PROJECT SUMMARY
The Advanced Analytics (AA) Core provides three main classes of advanced analytics services: Single-cell
genomics, Immunotechnologies, and EpCultures (new). EpCultures are organoid or planar cultures derived
from the intestines of donor humans or model organisms. These services are sophisticated in nature,
expensive for laboratories to independently perform, and require a high level of technical training. The AA Core
has always focused on developing innovative practices to reduce barriers of entry to these cutting-edge
technologies. While seemingly disparate, the services have been grouped together because of common
management expertise, consultation practices, and efficient business model practices. The core provides
services at substantially reduced costs and very rapid turnaround times. The AA Core is under the direction of
Scott Magness, PhD, who is considered a leader in single-cell genomic and functional assays. He has
expertise in intestinal and colonic organoid and self-renewing monolayer culture using primary tissue sources
derived from humans and other model organisms. The AA Core personnel are highly trained professionals in
these technically demanding methods, and have made the AA Core nationally recognized for single-cell
sequencing services. The Specific Aims of the AA Core are: 1) To offer state-of-the-art single-cell assays to
better understand disease/injury processes and epithelial regeneration at cell-level resolution. These assays
include, Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS), single-cell (sc) RNAseq, DNAseq, miRNA expression,
and single-cell Western blotting. 2) To provide immunoassay technologies for the detection of biomolecules
via ELISA and bead-based multiplex assay. Typically, CGIBD members use these assays to detect
biomarkers associated with various disease states, such as IBD. 3) To offer services related to organoid and
epithelial monolayer cultures (EpCultures), custom organoid assays, and training in EpCultures. Collectively,
they are powerful new technologies that provide highly physiologically relevant ex vivo models to study a
variety of health conditions that affect the GI tract."
10749932,"PROJECT SUMMARY - LARGE ANIMAL MODELS CORE
The Large Animal Models Core was developed at the time of the last competing renewal to address the
concern that in vitro cell culture systems and small animal models have not always translated well to solving
human health digestive disease problems. The core was designed to provide models more physiologically
similar to people. Over the past 5-years, the CGIBD has developed and strengthened a Large Animal Models
Core at the NC State University College of Veterinary Medicine focused on medical and surgical technologies
in pigs. The overall goal of the core is to provide a cost-effective central resource for Center investigators
wishing to understand mechanisms of digestive disease using large animals. This has been particularly
successful for CGIBD members interested in esophageal disease, in large part because the pig has proven to
be an excellent translational model of diseases such as eosinophilic esophagitis and gastroesophageal reflux
disease. The pig esophagus contains esophageal submucosal glands as does the human esophagus, while
mice lack these glands. Recent work through the core has helped to establish these glands as a progenitor cell
source in the esophagus. Disease models of intestinal ischemia have also continued to be a critical component
of the Core, again because pigs are thought to more closely resemble humans in terms of their response to
ischemia. Ex vivo (Ussing chambers) and in vitro studies, particularly those involving large animal complex cell
culture (2D and 3D) are now being offered to bolster the basic science output from large animals. Furthermore,
because of novel ideas related to the interaction of the gastrointestinal tract and the microbiome, we now plan
to introduce gnotobiotic pigs as an additional resource.
The specific aims of the core are: 1) to provide consultation with Core veterinarians to assess feasibility,
logistics and study design; 2) to assist with procurement of animals, and 3) to coordinate animal procedures,
including anesthesia, endoscopy, and surgery.
The Core directors (Blikslager and Gonzalez) have a demonstrated track record in digestive disease and are
board-certified veterinary specialists in surgery. Veterinary board-certified specialists in laboratory animal
medicine, internal medicine, anesthesia, and advanced imaging (MRI, CT, nuclear medicine) are readily
available from the NC State Veterinary Hospital. Newly renovated facilities funded in large part by an NIH G20
grant are crucial to the Core’s ability to offer medical, surgical and gnotobiotic capabilities adjacent to large
animal research housing. Based on funded projects developed with the Large Animal Models Core and CGIBD
investigators during the prior funded period, the Core will aim to have 4-6 projects running at any one time.
Although the Core currently serves a small number of members, it provides a remarkable scientific impact on
their research which would not be possible without the core."
10749934,"PILOT/FEASIBILITY PROGRAM
PROJECT SUMMARY
The mission of the Center for Gastrointestinal Biology and Disease (CGIBD) is to promote multidisciplinary
research to reduce the burden of digestive and liver diseases. The pilot/feasibility (P/F) program is one of the
most important strategies to achieve that mission. The program is designed to help investigators obtain
preliminary data necessary to successfully compete for external funds. The specific aims are: 1) To
aggressively publicize the program to assure a large pool of eligible applicants. 2) To provide a rigorous
scientific merit review process with initial review. 3) To exercise oversight of funded investigators to monitor
progress and improve chances of success. The program supports: 1) new investigators without current or past
NIH research project support 2) established non-digestive disease investigators proposing a digestive disease
project; 3) established, supported digestive disease investigators proposing a project which constitutes a
significant departure from ongoing research. We place highest priority on funding new investigators. During the
past 5 years 91% of awards were given to new investigators. Each year the CGIBD funds 4 new proposals with
budgets of approximately $30,000. The Dean of the School of Medicine provides funds for an additional award.
The CTSA also provides matching funds for acceptable applicants. The P/F program is aggressively promoted
leading to strong competition for slots. During the most recent year there were 21 applications. The review is
highly structured and rigorous. The review process, which mirrors that of the NIH, is online. The Executive
Committee and reviewers with expertise in the topic of the application conduct the first line of review. The top
applications are reviewed by the External Advisory Board who select candidates for funding after brief oral
presentations by the applicants. Critiques from both levels of review are rapidly shared with the applicants.
Following funding, the awardees meet with the CGIBD biostatistician. Their progress is carefully monitored with
formal written progress reports every 6 months. The awardees present their research at one of our weekly
seminars. The program has enjoyed great success over the past 10 years with 90% still engaged in GI
research and a return on investment of 20:1."

10749946,"PROJECT SUMMARY PAMOC
The overarching mission of the WU-DDRCC is to promote collaborative, multidisciplinary research focused on
interactions between host and environment in digestive disease. The Precision Animal Models and Organoids
Core (PAMOC) evolved over the previous funding period in response to changes in members' needs, and with
the establishment of a new institutional gnotobiotic facility. These changes, along with guidance from our External
Advisory Board, encouraged us to modify the services and objectives of this Core. Accordingly, our current
objectives are to 1) assist investigators in the efficient and cost-effective development and propagation of
genetically altered mouse models to elucidate the pathogenesis of digestive diseases; and 2) assist investigators
in the culture of human and mouse gastrointestinal epithelial cell organoids to address cell biological questions
relevant to digestive diseases and host-environment interactions. Both human and mouse gastrointestinal
epithelial cells and the required media are available to DDRCC investigators for growth and differentiation of
organoids. These novel models will serve as important avenues for pre-clinical studies and enable translation of
basic research advances into clinical practice. KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS since 2013 include: completed 24
nucleic acid injection projects (both conventional DNA transgenes and CRISPR/Cas9/targeting vector injections)
for 7 members; 3 embryonic stem cell injection projects for 2 members; and 11 withdrawals of transgenic/knockin
mice from the Mouse Bank by 9 members. Gnotobiotic services (provision of germ-free mice, rederivation to
germ-free status, and gnotobiotic conventionalization) were provided to 6 members. Related to the proposed
Organoid component, we have already distributed human cell lines as well as wild type and reporter mouse cell
lines to 13 members. We also provided L-WRN conditioned media to 9 members. Since 2013, 22 members used
the Core, resulting in 57 publications citing the WU-DDRCC. Our SPECIFIC AIMS include: (1) To assist
investigators in the generation and propagation of transgenic, knockout, and knockin mice for the study of
digestive diseases. This includes injections of nucleic acids, including CRISPR/Cas9 and TALEN reagents, into
zygotes, assistance with rederivation of lines as specific pathogen free, and in vitro fertilization. (2) To maintain
a “Mouse Bank” containing transgenic strains of use to DDRCC investigators and to provide these mice on
demand for digestive disease-relevant projects. (3) To provide banked human and mouse gastrointestinal
epithelial cell lines and the culture media required for successful growth of organoids and for growth of epithelial
cell monolayers. Support for monitoring cell growth and for imaging organoids will also be provided. (4) To
provide assistance with the derivation of new gastrointestinal epithelial cell lines from mice and humans. Aims 1
and 2 will continue to leverage the outstanding facilities, personnel, and expertise of the Washington University
Institutional Mouse Genetics Core. Aims 3 and 4 will benefit from infrastructure and expertise developed by Dr.

10749875,"ABSTRACT
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder for women of reproductive age.
Women with PCOS are at a high risk of health complications. In fact, women with PCOS have a 3-7 times
higher risk for type 2 diabetes, and obese women with PCOS have an even higher risk of type 2 diabetes.
Experts recommend that the first-line treatment for overweight and obese women with PCOS should be diet
and lifestyle interventions. Yet, experts disagree about the specific nutritional advice these interventions should
encourage, with different groups recommending no particular diet, a high-carbohydrate Dietary Approaches to
Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, or a lower carbohydrate diet. A systematic review of previous dietary trials in
PCOS did find a slight benefit of lower carbohydrate diets for glucose control, weight loss, insulin, and insulin
resistance. This may be because carbohydrate intake raises glucose levels, which in turn increases insulin
secretion. Insulin then stimulates ovarian androgen production and inhibits the release of fatty acids from cells.
Previous research in type 2 diabetes suggests that not simply lower carbohydrate intake, but a very low-
carbohydrate (VLC) diet, with less than 20% of calories from carbohydrates, designed to reduce body weight
and glucose levels more significantly than other types of lower carbohydrate diets, would be even more
effective for improving metabolic health in PCOS. Although reviews note that a VLC diet has shown promise
for type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular risk, evidence for PCOS is only emerging. In our
recently completed 4-month trial of 29 overweight or obese women with PCOS following a VLC diet, we found
significant improvements in outcomes, including glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c; -0.21%) and body weight
(-7.7%). We propose a 12-month randomized, controlled trial for 184 overweight or obese (BMI of 28-55 kg/m2)
adults with PCOS comparing a VLC diet and a standard-of-care low-fat, Dietary Approaches to Stop
Hypertension (DASH) diet. The program for both groups is delivered online, as in our pilot study. Aim 1: To
compare changes in glycemic control. We hypothesize that the VLC version will lead to greater improvements
in HbA1c at 12-months. Aim 2: To compare changes in secondary health outcomes tied to type 2 diabetes risk,
including glycemic variability, conversion to normoglycemia, body weight, and body fat percentage. We
hypothesize that the VLC version will lead to greater improvements in secondary health outcomes at 12-
months. Aim 3: To explore intervention satisfaction and acceptability. The guiding objective of this proposal is
to explore a novel diet and lifestyle approach for reducing the future risk of type 2 diabetes for overweight or
obese women with PCOS. We anticipate that the proposed research will have an important impact on diet and
lifestyle recommendations for this high-risk, understudied population."
10749877,"Project Summary
Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, affecting over 2.2 million Americans. With an
aging population, it is estimated that by 2020 the number of people suffering from glaucoma will reach 80 million
worldwide, with 11 million being bilaterally blind. Although elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is the primary risk
factor for the development of glaucomatous optic nerve damage , the mechanisms by which elevated IOP
eventually leads to damage are still unclear. Thus, there is a need to develop novel non-invasive imaging
modalities that can measure the fundamental mechanical properties of the posterior sclera, and characterize
how they contribute to damage in patients particularly as it relates to age, race, and severity of glaucomatous
damage. Such a tool would be an important step forward in ocular research and clinical practice, providing the
much-needed ability to evaluate the risk of disease based on person- and eye-specific characteristics.
The goal of this study is to develop a novel high-resolution ultrasound-based imaging platform non-invasively
measure biomechanical properties of the posterior sclera. To address this goal, we propose two imaging systems
utilizing dual frequency configuration. One system consists of a low-frequency (4.5 MHz) ring shape transducer
to “push” the tissue, and a needle single element transducer inside to “track” micron-level displacement; Another
system is to replace the needle transducer with a high-frequency single crystal linear phased array as receiver
for elastography imaging to first acquire real time and high speed elastography imaging of the posterior sclera.
2D/3D acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging and shear wave elasticity imaging (SWEI) will be
performed on ex-vivo unscaled rabbit sclera that will be preloaded with various IOP levels for evaluation. Our
preliminary results have demonstrated the principle of using the dual frequency ultrasonic elastography
technique on obtaining the biomechanical properties of the sclera and cornea. Integrating high-resolution ARFI
imaging with quantified tissue stiffness measurements via the propagation speed of the associated shear wave
can potentially allow us to characterize in detail the association between age and gender on the mechanical
properties of the sclera and allow us to explore the relationship with glaucoma"

Percocet™ and Oxycontin™) is reliably among the medications commonly prescribed for pain, but is also widely
abused and involved in overdose deaths. Despite its abuse potential, oxycodone is effective for reducing acute
pain. There is an urgent need for interventions that preserve the analgesic properties of oxycodone while
curtailing its abuse potential. A promising adjunctive treatment option for pain management, that could
simultaneously reduce the abuse liability of opioids, is syntocinon (the intranasal formulation of the
neuropeptide oxytocin). Syntocinon may reduce opioid abuse potential, and simultaneously has
analgesic properties. Animal models have shown that oxytocin decreases opioid intravenous self-
administration and reverses oxycodone conditioned place preference. Rat models of pain show that oxytocin
enhances anti-nociception (blocking of painful stimuli), and in humans, syntocinon administration decreases pain
sensitivity experimentally. Further, evidence in animals and humans support the shared brain structure and
function changes associated with both addiction and chronic pain, which may be modulated by oxytocin
administration. Based on the existing literature, we propose that syntocinon will significantly reduce abuse
liability of opioids and reduce experimental pain via its effects on brain structure, function and
biochemistry. Thirty healthy recreational opioid users will self-administer 48 IUs of intranasal syntocinon (or
placebo) shortly after oral oxycodone (0, 2.5, 5.0 mg) in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, within-
subjects laboratory study. Subject-rated abuse liability and cardiovascular and respiratory responses will be
assessed before and repeatedly for 5 hours following drug administration. Pain and neurobiological measures
will also be collected, including a standardized experimental pain battery (i.e., quantitative sensory testing) and
a multi-modal neuroimaging battery (i.e., brain structure, function, and biochemistry). This study has
tremendous potential for public health impact in examining intranasal oxytocin as a promising agent for
reducing opioid addictive potential, while effectively reducing pain, which could substantially advance the field of
pharmacotherapy and carve out a novel treatment option. This study will also advance scientific understanding
of neurobiological mechanisms underlying the link between abuse potential and pain. This research will also
facilitate the PI’s career goals and path to independence by developing expertise in 1) multi-modal assessments
of pain; 2) neuroimaging techniques as they relate to addiction and pain; 3) deepen current expertise in addiction
and human behavioral pharmacology in the context of opioid administration and translation; 4) grant and
manuscript writing skills; and 5) enhance management and supervision skills. This multidisciplinary team is
uniquely suited to mentor the PI in these areas and address the proposed aims."
10873813,"Breast and prostate cancer are two of the most common and survivable cancers and most survivors of these
cancers will be married when diagnosed. Compared to couples that aren't facing a chronic illness, both cancer
survivors and their spouses suffer from poorer physical and mental health that leads higher morbidity and
mortality. Since couples experience and navigate an illness together their health becomes intertwined, thus
programs aimed at one member of the dyad ignore the interdependent nature of the couple. Exercise improves
quality of life among cancer survivors; but, we were the first to adapt exercise to be a partnered activity that
amplifies the dose of exercise and builds teamwork to improve dyadic outcomes (i.e., physical and mental health
of patients and partners). We developed and piloted Exercising Together in prostate cancer survivors and their
spouses long after his diagnosis. The pilot showed that six months of partnered exercise could improve physical
and mental health in both partners as well as their intimate relationship. We believe the program would be most
effective at mitigating the impact of newly diagnosed cancer and treatment on the physical and mental health of
each partner if implemented much earlier in the point of care for patients. We have preliminary data on 10 couples
who participated in an adapted version of Exercising Together during his radiation treatment for prostate cancer
(6-8 weeks). The adapted program is much shorter (8 v. 24 wks.) than the original and is more focused on
developing teamwork as a mechanism to amplify the benefits of exercise on dyadic outcomes. All couples
completed the program and improved physical and mental health and their level of communication; however, we
had no control group so we cannot be certain if the program is efficacious or not nor how long lasting the effects
of the program might be. We now propose a Type I hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial of Exercising
Together adapted for the radiation oncology setting. This design allows us to formally test the efficacy of a clinic-
based version of Exercising Together using a randomized controlled design, a larger sample, a broader set of
outcomes, and a follow-up period. We will also examine putative dyadic mechanisms to explain how our
intervention improves dyadic health. At the same time, we will gather critical information from multiple
stakeholders to inform future implementation approaches to integrate Exercising Together into the care plan for
cancer patients. We propose a randomized controlled Phase II trial in 200 couples who will be randomly assigned
to participate in an 8-week program of Exercising Together at the start of his/her radiation therapy or to a usual
care control group that receives standard exercise guidance and receipt of a video of the couples program at the
end of participation. Couples are tested at baseline, post-intervention (2 mos.), and 4- and 6-mos. follow up.
Based on adaptations in other trials developed during COVID19, exercise training and assessments will be
delivered through remote technology, which allows us to better diversity the sample and widen the scalability of
the program."

predoctoral and postdoctoral AIPrN research training program at Prairie View A&M University (PVAMU), a
historically black university (HBCU), designed to provide multidisciplinary training in computational data skills
and precision nutrition to address the nutrition health disparities based on simulations and real-world research
projects covering obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer among underserved populations.
The aims of this proposal are to 1) recruit, train, and financially support underrepresented predoctoral students
and post-doctoral fellows in AI/ML or nutritional science to the AI-Precision Nutrition research training program
as a mechanism to increase the number of effective and diverse scientists integrating AI and Precision Nutrition
to address nutrition health disparities; 2) develop and enhance research training program, technical assistance,

and collaborative and integrated research in AI-Precision Nutrition approaches to tackle nutrition health
disparities; and 3) provide professional development and foster leadership skills in AI-Precision Nutrition for our
trainees who are positioned to apply for fellowships, grants, and as a way to facilitate exposure to careers in AI-
Precision Nutrition research and transition to research-intensive careers in academia, industry, the NIH, and
private foundations. These objectives will be met through rigorous didactic training, mentorship, engagement in
laboratory rotations for sample research projects, and professional and career development with a team of 12
faculty mentors that span across the chronic diseases mentioned in inclusive and diversity-friendly institutional
research environments at PVAMU and the USDA/ARS Children Nutrition Research Center, Baylor College of

10829831,"ABSTRACT
 People with unilateral vestibular hypofunction (VH, peripheral disease of the inner ear) are
thought to develop visual dependence. They get dizzy and off balance in complex visual
environments. They sway more with dynamic visuals compared to static or with eyes closed
compared to open. Individuals with UHL are not regularly assessed for balance function, but those
with at least moderate hearing loss show increased risk for falls. Data from mechanistic studies
in our lab have demonstrated that individuals with UHL do not increase postural sway in the
presence of complex visual scenes as much as healthy controls, suggesting they are not as reliant
on visual input to maintain their balance. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that individuals
with UHL may reallocate attentional resources to motor control of balance (conscious movement
processing) to compensate for the loss of auditory cues. To test the hypotheses of visual
dependence in VH and conscious movement processing in UHL, this proposal will combine
behavioral assessments of balance with analyses of network-based functional connectivity from
resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The long-term goal of this research
is to identify the neurobiological index explaining balance behavior and develop an intervention
approach targeting functional connectivity differences that maximizes functional mobility gains in
people with sensory loss. In the current project we will address the following Specific Aims: Aim
1: Identify balance profiles for people with VH and UHL. Individuals with VH, UHL and controls
(N=24 each) will perform a battery of balance measures including static, dynamic, gait, and tests
targeting sensory and cognitive aspects of balance. We will also analyze their postural sway from
force plate data as they are tested in a virtual reality environment. Aim 2: Identify internetwork
functional connectivity differences in VH, UHL, and healthy controls. Resting-state fMRI data will
be acquired from VH and UHL (N=12 each) and compared to a distribution of healthy control data.
Aim 3: Determine the extent to which balance performance (Aim 1) correlate with neurobiological
data (Aim 2) in VH and UHL. We will calculate correlations between postural sway data and ratio
of attention-motor connectivity to attention-vision connectivity.
 If we accomplish our aims, we will identify which balance domains are most affected by
vestibular and hearing loss and whether people with UHL should be regularly screened for
balance performance. We will establish which brain connections are altered by sensory loss and
the implications for balance. This knowledge will have important implications to public health for
improved assessment of balance and development of future interventions in VH and UHL."

The lateral septum (LS) is an enigmatic brain region that contributes to a multitude of behaviors and
has been implicated in a number of psychiatric disorders including anxiety. Over many decades,
researchers have attempted to ascertain how this one brain region gives rise to such functional
diversity. However, the results of these studies have often been contradictory. Early studies of the LS
divided it into distinct anatomical subregions, suggesting a putative role for its subregions in mediating
different functions. Recent research has revisited this earlier work and postulates that there are
functional subunits within the LS, which may be selecting for different behavioral outcomes. This
proposal seeks to address this theory by characterizing the anatomical organization, neural encoding
properties, and function of two LS projection populations. In particular, I will focus on two target regions
that receive input from the lateral septum and exemplify the functional diversity of the LS: the ventral
tegmental area (VTA) known for its role in reward representation and the bed nucleus of the stria
terminalis (BNST) known for its role in cue encoding. In Aim 1, I will perform projection-specific cellular
resolution calcium imaging during a series of operant behavioral paradigms to evaluate the role of each
projection population in reward-related behavior. I hypothesize that each projection population will
encode distinct task features, contributing to the functional diversity of the LS. Thus, I predict that the
LS-VTA will encode reward-related information and the LS-BNST will encode reward cues. In Aim 2, I
will use projection-specific, closed-loop optogenetic manipulations to determine the causal role of the
LS-VTA and LS-BNST projection populations in different trained reward-related behaviors. I will
quantify the effects of inhibition of these two populations on different behavioral outcomes on an operant
assay, which will provide insight into how these LS subpopulations are functionally distinct. The results
from this proposal will provide a more complete view of how the LS functions, specifically in reward-
related behaviors. It will further our understanding of a brain region that has evaded explanation for
many years and may prove to be a crucial target for the treatment of various psychiatric disorders."
10934339,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a prevalent and deadly disease characterized by the inability of the mitral
valve (MV) leaflets to coapt properly, permitting backflow of blood from the left ventricle into the left
atrium. The etiologies of MR are complex and diverse, ranging from myxomatous degeneration of the
valvular tissue to myocardial infarction to non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Several types of treatment are
available, but the efficacy of these interventions remains suboptimal and unpredictable. One of these
options is the relatively recent transcatheter edge-to-edge leaflet clipping technique called the MitraClip
procedure (or TEER). Though the procedure is safe, its outcomes in clinical trials, particularly compared
to other surgical and therapeutic treatments, have been highly contradictory, largely due to the
multifactorial nature of MR. Therefore, it is clear that a predictive approach to treatment selection that
accounts for patient specific variations in MV shape and deformation is necessary to optimize long-
term patient outcomes. Our group has developed a noninvasive, image-based method for in vivo MV
strain estimation which allows us to quantify MV shape and deformation directly from clinically available
imaging data. We have also previously demonstrated that this technique can be used to identify
predictive, presurgical factors of repair efficacy for ischemic MR patients undergoing undersized ring
annuloplasty. However, previous work by our lab and others has focused on limited subsets of MR
patients; in order to develop a comprehensive treatment selection guide, simulations must be grounded
in a robust understanding of the altered MV biomechanical state in the full range of MR etiologies.
Furthermore, the effects of the highly non-physiological focal stress of the MitraClip on the immediate
and long-term shape and deformation of the MV leaflets remains almost completely unknown. We will
additionally develop a fully predictive finite element simulation of the TEER procedure in order to
preoperatively test various MitraClip scenarios directly on a 3D model of the patient's MV apparatus,
use our understanding of the MV functional state to predict the 12-month outcomes of each
configuration, and select the most optimal option. Therefore, in this study, we aim to (1) establish the
pre-operative state of the MV across the MR spectrum and (2) elucidate and predict the consequences
of the MitraClip on MV leaflet geometry, behavior, and remodeling in order to explain and ultimately
predict the outcomes of this treatment in a patient-specific and quantitative manner."

 Application of MS/MS to newborn screening (NBS) has facilitated the early diagnosis and treatment of
infants with fatty acid oxidation disorders (FAOD) leading to decreased infant mortality and morbidity.
Mitochondrial Trifunctional Protein Deficiency (TFP) deficiency, including Long-chain 3-Hdyroxyacyl-CoA
Dehydrogenase (LCHAD) deficiency, are two FAOD currently included in US NBS for which prevention of
hypoketotic hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, and cardiomyopathy is generally achieved with early diagnosis and
institution of contemporary dietary therapy. However, progression of chorioretinopathy with vision loss
associated with LCHAD/TFP deficiencies has been observed in almost all patients despite early diagnosis and
initiation of treatment. Progressive retinopathy in LCHAD/TFP is a unique complication not observed in other
FAOD and the underlying etiology of the retinopathy is not completely understood. The specific focus of this
application is to characterize the progression of chorioretinopathy in a prospective natural history study,
determine clinical and physiologic factors that are associated with retinal changes and vision loss and estimate
the rate of retinal change in a cohort of patients with LCHAD and TFP deficiencies.
 We propose conducting a prospective deep phenotyping study of LCHAD/TFP deficient retinopathy
among 44 patients diagnosed with LCHAD/TFP deficiencies followed over time. The retinal degeneration is
thought to begin with the loss of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and is associated with increased
LCHAD/TFP specific plasma metabolites, hydroxyacylcarnitines, increasing age, number of hospitalizations
and genetic mutations. Using recent advances in neural retinal imaging including autofluoresence, structural
optical coherence tomography (OCT), OCT angiography (OCTA), microperimetry, we will image the layers of
the retina in patients with LCHAD/TFP stratified by age at various stages of progression. Our hypothesis is that
loss of RPE will precede both choriocapillaris dropout and photoreceptor degeneration suggesting the RPE is
the initial cell layer affected in the progression of LCHADD/TFPD retinopathy. We will correlate changes in
retinal structure and measures of visual acuity to environmental factors associated with progression of retinal
degeneration. Our hypothesis is that increased metabolic crisis, higher hydroxyacylcarnitines, and older age
will be associated with RPE loss, visual function decline and decreased quality of life suggesting a toxic
intermediate etiology to the progression of LCHAD-retinopathy. Each subject enrolled in the cohort will be
evaluated on two occasions, approximately 2 years apart to estimate the rate of change over time. The results
will help us understand the etiology of retinopathy and potentially suggest a treatment approach such as retinal
gene therapy to halt retinal degeneration and prevent vision loss."

The overarching goals of this application are to: 1) maintain retention of children in the Vanderbilt CANOE birth
cohort with emphasis on diversity and implementation of the ECHO Cohort Protocol with high fidelity and
conduct new enrollment, and 2) address key questions in the field about one of the most common and
modifiable early life environmental exposures consistently associated with significantly increased asthma risk,
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, delineating the severity-dependent and age-dependent effects of
RSV infection on asthma risk. This innovative project has significant public health impact, as establishing the
age- and severity-dependent relationship between RSV and asthma is the first and most important step in
disease primary prevention. We propose to address key unanswered questions in the field: the severity- and
age-dependent association of RSV and asthma, and the impact of infection on lung function. In addition, we
will explore the broad impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on asthma incidence and control in an exploratory
aim, which may provide support for multi-faceted environmental modifications in asthma prevention and
control, and data to inform the potential impact of broad public health interventions.
The birth cohort that this application supports is the Vanderbilt CANOE (Childhood Allergy and the NeOnatal
Environment) study. CANOE is a birth cohort designed to identify and understand how environmental factors
modify the development of the airway epithelium. The study includes the unique longitudinal sampling of the
child airway throughout the first year of life, and annually. The Vanderbilt CANOE study has unique early life
exposure and outcomes ascertainment, including surveillance for RSV and a novel biospecimen repository of
nasal airway epithelial cells. The CANOE cohort also has important information for longitudinal development of
the airway microbiome and the airway epithelium. The proposed research is innovative and timely given the
anticipated licensure of multiple RSV prevention products in the coming year (maternal vaccines and long-
acting monoclonal antibodies for infants). The proposed work represents a novel, multi-faceted approach to
identifying and understanding the influence of severity of RSV infection and age of RSV infection on asthma
risk and lung function. The answers to these questions will be critical to developing prevention strategies and
informing public health expectations for RSV non-pharmaceutical preventive strategies and evaluating potential
long-term value-added benefits of vaccines in preventing lifelong chronic respiratory disease. These data may
not only bolster RSV vaccine acceptability and uptake in the US, but will almost certainly be useful in
evaluating the cost-effectiveness of RSV prevention strategies in low and middle income countries."

Huntington’s Disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant, neurodegenerative disease characterized by involuntary
movement dysfunction, and cognitive and psychiatric symptoms, ultimately resulting in death. Although
diagnostic testing is available for HD, there remains a critical need for an objective clinical marker to characterize
both disease onset and progression. In order to develop effective therapeutics to support early intervention and
prevent decline, we need to understand the early-stage biological changes in the living brain that occur at disease
conversion. Imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) facilitates in vivo longitudinal measurements of
molecular changes that manifest with evolving pathology. To date however, no PET ligands have been generated
to predict disease conversion or aid prognosis in HD. Recent studies have shown that glial cell activation can be
detected either at or just prior to the onset of symptoms in HD patients, evoking potential for the development of
such a ligand. In addition, there is emerging evidence from neurodegenerative disease models that microglia,
the brain’s resident immune cells, play an important role in some of the earliest pathological events, including
synaptic loss. Our preliminary data showing increased cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein in both HD patient and
HD mouse model brains (postmortem), suggest it holds promise as a novel clinical marker. Preclinical models
exhibit elevated COX-2 during periods of microglia-mediated synaptic elimination, an event early in the pathology
of many neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, we see COX-2 is increased specifically in the microglia of
disease-affected regions in human HD post-mortem brain tissue. The only way to truly understand the role that
COX-2 plays in HD is to examine its presence and dynamics in the human brain throughout the course of
disease. Therefore, we propose to develop a selective radiotracer for in vivo PET imaging to study COX-2
dysregulation in the living brain, and carry out ex vivo mechanistic studies of COX-2 function in microglia. We
will synthesize novel COX-2-selective ligands, optimized for affinity, target selectivity, high brain uptake, and
amenability to radiolabeling with carbon-11 or fluorine-18. These ligands will undergo rigorous physiochemical
and biochemical profiling, including assays that evaluate COX-2-isoform selectivity, and that predict blood-brain
barrier penetration. Lead compounds will be radiolabeled and evaluated with in vitro autoradiography using
human HD post-mortem brain tissue to evaluate specific and saturable binding. This will be followed by in vivo
imaging in rodents with PET to evaluate brain uptake, radiotracer kinetics, and radiometabolites. In parallel, we
will elucidate biochemical mechanisms of COX-2 in microglia in HD mouse models, and investigate the role
COX-2 plays in altering microglial function. By the end of the grant project period, our team will have the ability
to study COX-2 in the living brain with translational imaging tools, enabling improved understanding of HD
pathophysiology and accelerating development of novel therapeutics."

The Botulinum Toxin Potency Assay using Tissue Chips program from FDA and NCATS highlights the need for
novel engineered systems capable of reliably evaluating botulinum toxin (BoT) potency. Human induced
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived motor neurons and muscle cells have been previously maintained in co-
culture and shown to form functional synaptic contacts representing in vivo neuromuscular junctions (NMJs).
However, the ability to effectively model NMJ functional responses to BoT using in vitro platforms amenable to
high-throughput screening has yet to be achieved due to the complexity of generating mature and functionally
competent NMJs in culture. The development of a high-throughput platform capable of promoting NMJ
development across a multiplexed assay will have a substantial positive impact on BoT production, as well as
advanced therapy development, drug efficacy/toxicity screening, and mechanistic studies of neuronal and NMJ
pathophysiology in neurodegenerative diseases. Based on preliminary work and published data, we posit that a
culture platform integrating electrode-based stimulation of neuronal firing and magnet-based measurement of
engineered muscle contraction will enable real-time analysis of NMJ development and function at baseline and
in response to BoT exposure. Using iPSC-derived motor neurons and muscle cells, we will establish organized
co-cultures within a culture plate that is compatible with our company’s existing muscle contractility assay,
MantarrayTM. Microchannels in the walls separating the cells will allow neuronal processes to grow into the
muscle compartment, facilitating synaptic contact. Tests with reference batches of BoT, in terms of their ability
to alter synaptic communication between our cell populations, will then be used to demonstrate the suitability of
this model for assaying NMJ function and BoT potency in vitro (Phase 1). Once validated, our NMJ assay will be
further evaluated to determine its accuracy, precision, specificity, and reproducibility in modeling BoT responses
in human tissues (Phase 2). Reference batches of BoT will be tested across a wide range of donor cell sources
and in comparison to an array of reference compounds with known and predictable effects on NMJ function. The
central hypothesis of this work is that differences in NMJ function between engineered skeletal muscle and motor
neuron co-cultures treated with different doses of BoT will enable stratification of phenotypes that can be
successfully used to plot dose response curves comparable to output data from mouse lethality bioassays (the
current gold standard for BoT potency screening). Successful completion of this study will provide a new
prototype human-based platform for modeling human peripheral neuropathies as well as a valuable preclinical
screening tool for assessing novel therapeutics. The consumable plate will be integrated with Curi’s existing
hardware/software packages and so can be quickly disseminated to customers upon validation."

Pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease with a five-year survival rate below 10%. One of the main factors
underscoring this low survival rate is the lack of effective clinical treatments. The chemotherapy gemcitabine is
the most widely used agent for pancreatic cancer due to its well tolerated profile, even though treatment only
marginally extends survival. In other cancers, gemcitabine can be very effective. The limited utility of
gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer is thought to result from non-cancerous cells in the tumor creating a physical
barrier limiting drug delivery. According to this model, chemotherapeutic agents are unable to penetrate the
tumor and reach the cancer cells. We found that tumor associated macrophages (TAMs), a non-cancerous
immune cell type, abundantly secrete the nucleoside deoxycytidine (dC), and this directly inhibits the cytotoxic
activity of gemcitabine. In this research proposal, we will define how dC is made and released by TAMs and
how dC is obtained and utilized by pancreatic cancer cells to promote gemcitabine resistance. We will also test
the hypothesis that dC release is a TAM property that can be reversed by reprogramming the TAM phenotype.
These studies will be accomplished using metabolomics techniques in combination with inhibitors of
metabolism and signal transduction. In parallel, we will disrupt TAM-pancreatic cancer dC crosstalk in human
patient-derived microtumor models and in syngeneic mouse models to determine the translation value. The
clinical application of insights from these studies could have an immediate impact on patients. A means to
predict gemcitabine response based on TAM properties and/or to enhance gemcitabine efficacy by targeting
the TAM phenotype would increase the utility of this well-tolerated, mainstay treatment option for patients with
pancreatic cancer."

 Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disorder of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells
(HSPCs) associated with sequential acquisition of driver gene mutations. These mutations often lead to altered
genome organization and transcriptional programs that perturb HSC self-renewal and differentiation. Recently,
we discovered that HOTTIP, a posterior HOXA-associated long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), remodels CTCF-
defined topologically associated domains (TADs). This remodeling regulates the homeotic gene-associated
leukemic transcription program and facilitates AML leukemogenesis, driven by MLL rearrangement (MLLr+) or
NMP1 mutation (NPM1C+). One of the top HOTTIP-regulated transcription motifs in AML is CTCF-binding sites
(CBSs), suggesting a novel function of HOTTIP in regulating CTCF-mediated genome organization and AML
pathogenesis. Indeed, combined RNA-seq, ChIRP-seq, and CTCF ChIP-seq analyses revealed that HOTTIP
co-occupied with CTCF in a subset of the AML genome, including HOXA and WNT/β-catenin target gene loci,
for their activation. However, it remains unknown whether and how HOTTIP lncRNA directly regulates CTCF-
directed genome organization to promote leukemic transcription networks and leukemogenesis. Our preliminary
data showed that HOTTIP is capable of directly interacting with key TAD boundary CBSs in the HOXA and WNT
target loci via formation of an R-loop structure. We hypothesize that HOTTIP activation mediates aberrant R-
loop formation in CBSs to stratify CTCF chromatin boundary for reprograming AML TADs and leukemic
transcription networks, leading to HSPC perturbation and leukemogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we will focus
on the impact of the altered CTCF TAD boundary and R-loop formation upon HOTTIP activation on AML genome
regulation and gene transcription output. In this proposal we will test the importance of the HOTTIP activation-
mediated aberrant R-loop formation in modulating the CTCF boundary activity and transcriptional regulation in
AML. Specifically, we will identify and characterize critical HOTTIP-regulated CTCF chromatin boundaries in the
AML genome. We will then define the novel role of R-loops in HOTTIP-mediated CTCF chromatin boundary
definition and genome organization. Finally, we will assess the impact of the HOTTIP-mediated aberrant R-loop
formation at specific TAD boundaries on leukemogenesis and HSPC regulation."

Loss of a loved one elevates the risk for physical and mental illness and leads to impaired daily function. For
most people, the deleterious effects of loss improve with time. However, in a subset of bereaved individuals, the
failure to adapt leads to pathological manifestations of loss and an extension of bereavement-associated health
impairments. A lack of investigation into the neuronal and molecular processes that underlie healthy
adaptation to loss has hampered our ability to ameliorate the negative consequences of loss. To address this
gap in our understanding, we propose to use partner separation in monogamous prairie voles to operationally
produce loss. Socially monogamous prairie voles form life-long pair bonds and exhibit distress upon partner
separation. However, pairs bonds fade with time after partner separation, as evidenced by reduced bonding-
related behaviors. To identify the key neural and molecular changes that underlie the adaptive processes
engaged after loss of a partner, we will compare voles with intact partner bonds to those who have been
separated from their partner. In Aim 1, we will comprehensively assess behavioral and transcriptional
responses to partner separation over time. In Aim 2, we will ask how the molecular identity of the neurons
responsive to partner interaction changes as a function of separation time. Finally, in Aim 3 we will test the
hypothesis that ablation of partner-active neurons facilitates bond dissolution and enables the vole to form a
new bond. Together, these experiments will provide the first insights into key neuromolecular changes that
underlie adaptation to loss, thereby representing potential therapeutic targets for treating the negative aspects
of grief and Prolonged Grief Disorder."

Onchocerciasis (river blindness) is a major (vector-borne) neglected tropical disease caused by Onchocerca
volvulus and proposed by the World Health Organization for elimination of transmission (EOT) by 2030.
Currently, national control programs attempt to achieve EOT with mass drug administration (MDA) of ivermectin
(IVM) to individuals aged ≥5 years over prolonged periods. IVM is microfilaricidal (kills the microfilariae, mf). By
2013, only a 31% reduction in mf prevalence was achieved since MDA with IVM began in the early 1990’s,
making it clear that EOT using IVM alone would not be reached. The 2018 approval of moxidectin (MOX) for
treatment of individuals aged ≥12 years was a significant milestone in enhancing the prospects of achieving
EOT. However, as MOX is deemed to be mainly microfilaricidal (but see below), it will likely not be sufficient to
meet EOT by 2030 in all endemic areas. Therefore, the development of new drugs and alternative treatment
regimens to achieve onchocerciasis EOT is a pressing need.
 We propose to develop novel drugs and treatment regimens for facilitating sustained elimination of human
onchocerciasis, based on our significant progress on: a) identification of filarial hit drugs with macrofilaricidal
activity and their putative targets; b) demonstration that in vitro, MOX, a candidate MDA drug and emodepside
(EMO), a macrofilaricidal repurposed drug under clinical development, target the early stages of worm
development and could consequently prevent or reduce the establishment of adult worms (defined as having
prophylactic potential); and c) transmission dynamics modelling incorporating prophylactic regimens with IVM or
MOX that has already indicated that bi-annual or quarterly MOX MDA would greatly help accelerate WHO’s
elimination goals compared to IVM.
 Our proposed aims build on the substantial progress we have thus far made and comprise: i) rationally
designing novel macrofilaricidal drug candidates via medicinal chemistry optimization of known HIV-aspartic
protease inhibitors (ritonavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir) that are active against 3 filarial species in vitro and in vivo;
ii) evaluating in parallel, in vivo, the prophylactic potential of MOX and EMO (selected based on promising in
vitro results and known PK and PD profiles in humans), and iii) evaluating innovative combination treatment
approaches in vivo (using well-established filariasis animal models) as well as in silico by undertaking
mathematical modelling to identify which suites of interventions would have the greatest potential to accelerate
and protect onchocerciasis EOT in Africa.
By the end of the project, we anticipate to have developed novel macrofilaricidal drug candidates which target
one or more aspartic proteases for advanced preclinical studies and to have identified pioneering treatment
regimens through prophylaxis that will augment the critically needed complementary tools for developing new
integrated therapeutic strategies for facilitating sustained elimination of human onchocerciasis."

Mendelian variation in pigmentation is a rich genetic resource to identify and study signaling pathways relevant
to human biology, but the repertoire of mutations that affect pigmentation in mice and in humans coat color has
become saturated. Advances in genome sequencing technology now extend the reach of forward genetics
beyond humans and model organisms to domestic and wild animals, for which there are many pigmentary
phenotypes likely to represent conserved signaling pathways but whose molecular basis is unknown.
Using pigmentary variation in domestic cats, our research group discovered a striking connection between a
novel transmembrane protease encoded by Transmembrane aminopeptidase Q (Taqpep) and a secreted Wnt
inhibitor encoded by Dickkopf 4 (Dkk4). Initial studies of Taqpep knockout mice reveal a role in multiple cell
types and tissues including hair, the enteric nervous system, and the palate. In a different non-model organism,
the plains zebra, Taqpep is a candidate gene for aberrant striping in an isolated population in Rwanda.
Our results point to a central role for Taqpep in pathways and tissues that are directly relevant to human
biology and disease, but a molecular understanding of those pathways is most effectively approached by
combining forward genetics for gene discovery in non-model mammalian organisms with experimental genetics
in laboratory mice and studies in cultured mammalian cells. We propose to:
(1) Identify additional components of Taqpep action by forward genetics in Bengal cats and by analysis of fetal
 cat skin
(2) Expand initial genetic studies of color pattern variation in zebras
(3) Determine the mechanism of Taqpep action using experimental mouse genetics and proteomics"

 Attention is comprised of several component processes, including sustained attention, selective
attention, and attentional flexibility. The first phase, the initial focusing of attention, precludes engagement of
other components making it an important building block of many of our more complex behaviors. Additionally,
attention impairments often present as a comorbidity in conditions including but not limited to schizophrenia,
autism, depression, and epilepsy, making identifying therapeutic targets a significant public health concern.
Convergent data point to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) as a hub for supporting attentional shifting along
with other key structures, while its role in the initial engagement of attention is less clear. Somehow, mPFC
pyramidal neurons integrate information from multiple sources, represent task rules, cue, and response-related
information in dynamically active ensembles, and select appropriate behavioral responses. Previous
physiological data suggests this astounding computational feat is made possible due to the powerful regulation
of pyramidal neuron activity by cortical inhibitory interneurons, but many studies lacked the ability to monitor
distinct cell-classes with specificity. Using fiber photometry of GCaMP-mediated Ca2+ signals in mPFC
parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PVINs), we have collected preliminary data demonstrating that PVINs
play a novel role in cue-perception during a visual attentional engagement task (AET). Specifically, we have
observed that cue-evoked population increases in PVIN activity are necessary, sufficient, and can be predictive
for successful attentional engagement. We hypothesize that this may represent a universal mechanism of
attention that is consistently disrupted across diseases with attentional impairments. PVINs however, do not
operate in isolation, and mPFC pyramidal neurons are also regulated by long-range inputs from the
mediodorsal thalamus (MD) among others, and local circuit interactions with other interneuron subtypes, such
as somatostatin (SOM) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) expressing interneurons, all of which have
also been linked to cognition and psychiatric disease dysfunction. Separate studies have identified distinct
disinhibitory circuits involving VIP and SST interneurons, and SST and PV interneurons that can regulate
mPFC-dependent behaviors. However, the precise circuit motifs which regulate attentional processes are
largely uncharacterized. Specifically, how individual interneurons in specific classes represent information
during attentional assays capturing distinct components of attention remains to be determined. Through the
K99 phase, I will receive critical training in in vivo Ca2+ imaging and design and implementation of attentional
tasks to test my overall hypothesis that PVINs provide broad inhibition to suppress distracting information
during attentional engagement, while the R00 phase will examine how separate disinhibitory circuit motifs allow
pyramidal neuron ensembles to signal cue and response information to appropriately guide separate attention
functions."
10754897,"About one-third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), and ≈10% of these
individuals will at some point develop active tuberculosis (TB). The risk of TB reactivation is greater in people
affected by type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and HIV, whereas, paradoxically, obesity protects against TB
disease. The underlying molecular mechanisms that explain how these co-morbidities impact TB disease
progression are mostly unknown. Although many studies have implicated incompetent immune systems to
pulmonary TB reactivation pathogenesis, our published data links pulmonary TB pathogenesis and bacterial
burden to adipose tissue (AT) pathophysiology. The objective of this proposal is to dissect the role of
adipocytes/AT in regulating immuno-metabolic mechanisms underlying pulmonary pathogenesis and examine
the significance of fat loss or adipogenesis in the pathogenesis of pulmonary TB infection. Our central
hypothesis is that an acute loss of adipocytes perturbs immuno-metabolic homeostasis in the lungs and
upsets immune-cell activation via adiponectin (an anti-inflammatory adipokine) signaling during Mtb infection.
This hypothesis is strongly supported by our published data which demonstrates that ablation of fat cells
induces pulmonary expression of adiponectin, an anti-inflammatory adipokine, and increases the levels of
foamy macrophages and elevates Mtb burden in the lungs. In addition we showed that dying adipocytes
release apoptotic bodies (ApoBDs) that express adiponectin accumulate in the lungs and may mediate
pulmonary adipogenesis in infected mice. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims:
1) To study the impact of fat ablation and adipogenesis in AT on pulmonary pathology and Mtb burden during
acute and chronic Mtb infections; 2) To examine the regulatory effect of gain or loss of fat cells on the
activation status of immune cells in AT and lung during acute and chronic stages of infection; and 3) To
investigate adipocytes communication mechanism(s) in regulating pulmonary adiponectin expression, immune
cells activation, and pathology during Mtb infection. This proposal is technically innovative in our use of a
combination of diet-induced adipogenic and fat-mass amendable murine TB models to manipulate body fat
mass to investigate the role of adipocytes and adipokines in regulating pulmonary TB infection severity. A
significant strength of this application is the proposed study design which includes a unique animal model, diet
intervention, different Mtb strains, two disease models and various in vitro studies. The proposed research is
significant, because it will identify the molecular links between adipocyte physiology and TB and dissect the
role of adiponectin signaling in the pathogenesis and severity of pulmonary TB infection. The results will have
an important positive impact because the proposed studies will help facilitate the identification of therapeutic
targets for early intervention in populations at risk for TB reactivation and will impact clinical decisions
regarding TB clinical management."

Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a herpesvirus whose seroprevalence and disease burden remain high
worldwide. While disease is often mild in immunocompetent individuals, it is often severe for
immunocompromised individuals, and congenital infection remains a leading cause of birth defects. There is
currently no vaccine or permanent effective anti-viral therapy against HCMV. The host enzyme telomerase,
which maintains telomeres to protect the integrity of DNA, is key for cell survival and has been implicated in
several diseases including cancer. Telomerase has been implicated as an important agent in the life cycles
and potential oncogenic activity of several herpesviruses, and recently has been shown to be hyperactive in
response to active HCMV infection. Furthermore, telomerase inhibition has been associated with a significant
reduction of viral infectivity in laboratory and clinical strains of HCMV. However, the significance of telomerase
in the HCMV viral life cycle, and the potential therapeutic implications of this relationship, remain unexplored.
We hypothesize host telomerase is important for the HCMV viral life cycle. We will first establish telomerase
activity upregulation upon HCMV infection, and reduced HCMV replication following telomerase inhibition, in
multiple strains and cell lines using several approaches to telomerase repression. Assays of telomerase
activity in the presence of pharmaceutical telomerase inhibitors BIBR1532 and MST-312 will establish a
reduction of viral infectivity following telomerase inhibition in both laboratory and clinical strains. Subsequent
assays using inducible genetic inhibitors, specifically siRNA and inducible shRNA constructs against hTERT,
will test whether reduction of viral replication is a result of telomerase inhibition and not off-target effects. To
define the mechanism of action by which HCMV upregulates telomerase activity, we will assess telomerase
activity following ectopic expression and shRNA-mediated knockdown of key viral genes, and implicated gene
products will be subjected to binding assays in infected and telomerase-inhibited infected conditions to assess
association with DNA via ChiP and QTIP assays, and with other proteins via IP and mass spectrometry. ChiP
assays in infected and telomerase-inhibited infected conditions will also be performed on host proteins
previously shown to influence telomerase activity. To define the function of telomerase in the viral life cycle, we
will conduct differentially-timed inhibition of telomerase and assess the viral gene class(es) the activity of which
is constrained by the absence of telomerase. Overall, these experiments will establish the potential clinical
relevance of telomerase in HCMV infection and define both the mechanism of action by which HCMV
upregulates telomerase activity and the function of telomerase in the viral life cycle. Increased understanding
of these relationships may provide insight into other herpesviruses, inform clinical HCMV management, and
lead to new anti-viral therapies."

Preterm (<37 completed weeks of gestation) birth (PTB) causes the majority of neonatal mortality and morbidity.
Around 50% of PTBs are associated with preterm premature (i.e., pre-labor) weakening and rupture of the fetal
membranes (FM: amnion-chorion-decidua parietalis) (pPROM). Infection/inflammation and decidual bleeding are
major drivers of pPROM. Development of therapies to prevent pPROM and PTB are confounded by gaps in
understanding how pregnancy is maintained in the face of inflammatory and bleeding challenges at the FM. The
proposed research builds on our previous work examining the mechanisms by which inflammatory stimuli increase
risk for pPROM by weakening the FM, and our demonstration that progesterone (P4) prevents inflammation-
induced FM weakening. Using our ex-vivo FM explant model, we found that inflammatory stimuli weaken FM by
inducing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) production by decidual stromal (DS) cells.
Our studies suggest GM-CSF is a critical intermediate in both inflammation- and bleeding-induced FM weakening.
Importantly, we found that P4 prevents GM-CSF production by DS cells. Recently we found that GM-CSF, in
addition initiating a cascade of events which cause FM weakening, induces P4 production within the FM. Based on
those data, we hypothesize that a locally-acting, paracrine, negative-feedback system exists within the FM, whereby
GM-CSF produced in response to localized inflammatory and bleeding stimuli induces P4 production by adjacent
chorion cytotrophoblast (CTB) cells. The P4, in turn, inhibits GM-CSF production by the DS cells and GM-CSF-
induced FM weakening. This hypothesis is supported by our recent finding that blocking P4 production or action
each independently weakens the FM. Thus, locally produced and locally acting P4 is essential for maintaining the
structural integrity of the FM. This novel and groundbreaking hypothesis will be tested by achieving two Specific
Aims: 1) identify the signaling pathway by which GM-CSF increases P4 production by CTB cells and whether this
P4 production declines in association with FM weakening at term and pPROM, and 2) determine the mechanism
by which P4 exerts anti-inflammatory activity in DS cells. Achieving the Specific Aims will provide more substantive
understanding of P4 function at the human maternal-fetal interface to maintain human pregnancy and prevent
pPROM. Understanding this process is important for development of effective therapies to prevent, or at least
decrease, the risk for pPROM-induced preterm birth."

Zinc binding metalloproteins and metalloenzymes constitute approximately 10% of the vertebrate proteome and
are essential for many cellular processes. Due to the critical importance of zinc to vertebrate physiology, zinc
deficiency leads to growth defects, aberrant immune function, neurological disorders, cancers, and increased
risk of infection. This is a pervasive public health problem considering that approximately half of the world's
population suffers from dietary zinc deficiency, now the fifth most important risk factor for mortality in developing
countries. Although the clinical link between Zn deficiency and infection is established, the molecular
mechanisms are not well understood. Despite the known importance of zinc cofactors to cellular function, the
mechanism by which zinc is inserted into metalloproteins is poorly understood. In this application we report our
discovery of zinc-regulated GTPase metalloprotein activator 1 (Zng1) as the first reported zinc metallochaperone
that inserts zinc into cognate client metalloproteins. We identify the protein processing enzyme methionine
aminopeptidase 1 (Metap1) and the transcription factor zinc finger homeobox 3 (Zfhx3) as Zng1 clients, and we
describe a conserved domain that mediates an interaction between Zng1 and these metalloproteins. This finding
forms the basis of proposed structural, biochemical, and physiological experiments to define the mechanism of
Zng1-dependent metal delivery to client proteins. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in Zng1 are associated with
increased incidence of severe infections in humans, establishing an important link between Zng1 and infection
in the zinc starved host. Zng1-dependent metal transfer increases the functional activities of Metap1 and Zfhx3,
and loss of Zng1 activity in mice and zebrafish negatively impacts organismal development and increases
susceptibility to multiple infectious diseases. Based on these findings, we propose a model whereby the Zng1
family of enzymes are evolutionarily conserved metallochaperones that transfer zinc to Metap1 and Zfhx3 during
conditions of extreme zinc deficiency. We predict that this process of co-factor delivery leads to regulated protein
processing through Metap1 and coordinated gene expression changes through Zfhx3. Combined, these activities
help orchestrate the cellular response to infection during zinc starvation. Experiments described in this proposal
will test this model and determine the molecular mechanism by which Zng1 transfers metal to Metap1 and Zfhx3,
define the role of Zng1-client interactions in proteostasis and transcription, and reveal the in vivo contribution of
Zng1 metal delivery to vertebrate defense against infection. Collectively, findings from this proposal will uncover
the biological and pathophysiological relevance of this newly identified family of zinc metallochaperones and
make important contributions to nutrition and infection biology."

Adeno-associated viruses (AAV) have become increasingly popular as vectors for human gene therapy.
However, the requirement for high vector doses needed to achieve therapeutic efficacy poses a challenge to
cost-effective manufacturing of AAV vectors for clinical use. The fundamental process of AAV vector
production is virion assembly, the process by which 60 VP capsid protein subunits form an icosahedral protein
shell followed by AAV vector genome packaging. Unfortunately, this basic process remains poorly understood
and there is an urgent need to elucidate the process and mechanisms underlying AAV vector production. Such
an understanding also could potentially uncover the key to production of high titer and high-quality AAV
vectors. In this regard, there was a paradigm-shifting discovery in 2010 that the AAV cap gene expresses
assembly-activating protein (AAP), a previously unidentified non-structural protein that promotes capsid
assembly. Unexpectedly, studies on AAV capsid assembly from our group and others in the post-AAP
discovery era have convincingly demonstrated that the AAV capsid assembly process is not conserved among
different AAV serotypes, that is, knowledge of AAV capsid assembly built in the pre-AAP discovery era through
studies using AAV2 is not translatable to capsid assembly of other AAV serotypes. Our preliminary data has
challenged the long-standing dogma of AAV capsid assembly in the nucleolus and revealed significant
serotype-dependent heterogeneity in the capsid assembly process. In addition, there is a growing appreciation
for additional roles that AAP plays beyond promoting capsid assembly. Here, in order to advance our
understanding of AAV vectors and improve their effective utilization in gene therapy, we seek to thoroughly
understand the AAV capsid assembly process and the multifaceted roles of AAP in virion assembly of AAV
vectors, using robust approaches including high-throughput mutagenesis, directed evolution, barcoding,
proximity-based labeling based on BioID, and state-of-the-art bottom-up and top-down mass spectrometry.
Furthermore, we will explore various potential strategies to enhance the yield and quality of AAV vectors
through manipulation of various pathways we will identify in the project. Thus, the specific aims of this project
are: (Aim1) To comprehensively understand AAP biology in the process of virion assembly of AAV vectors that
varies across different AAV serotypes; (Aim 2) To identify host cell proteins involved in AAV capsid assembly;
and (Aim 3) To explore novel strategies to enhance the yield and quality of AAV vectors by manipulating the
process of virion assembly. Our project will not only address fundamental questions about the mechanism of
virion assembly of AAV vectors, but also substantially further our understanding of AAV-host interactions in
general. The project also has potential to discover novel strategies to improve vector production."
10754554,"Patients with systemic autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have an increased risk of developing premature cardiovascular disease (CVD), the chief contributor to morbidity and mortality in this patient population. Clinical studies have highlighted evidence of vascular disease in SLE patients, such as endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness, which predisposes them to the development of vascular lesions, but the initiating factors that cause endothelial dysfunction are unknown. The central goal of this project is to identify the factors that contribute to the development of vascular dysfunction in SLE. To accomplish this goal, a clinically relevant model of SLE, the female NZBWF1 mouse, will be utilized. Both SLE mice and patients with SLE produce autoantibodies that mediate tissue injury and lead to end-organ damage. Previous studies by the mentor, Dr. Michael Ryan, show that by 20 weeks of age, NZBWF1 mice have impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation as compared to control NZW mice, but the role of autoantibodies in mediating the endothelial dysfunction is unknown. Thus, specific aim 1 will test the hypothesis that pathogenic autoantibodies produced during SLE cause vascular dysfunction during SLE. Dr. Taylor will receive additional training in laboratory techniques, including vascular reactivity studies and gut microbiome analyses. Recent studies have implicated gut dysbiosis, a condition of altered microbiota composition, in the pathogenesis of SLE in both patients and the NZBWF1 mouse. While it is recognized that the gut microbiome is an important physiological and immunological regulator, a mechanistic link between gut dysbiosis and vascular dysfunction has not been identified. The independent phase of this proposal will examine potential mechanisms whereby gut dysbiosis contributes to vascular dysfunction in SLE. Specific aim 2 will test the hypothesis that circulating bacterial products promote endothelial dysfunction in SLE by increasing endothelial and monocytic TLR signaling, contributing to endothelial cell activation and damage. The third specific aim will test the hypothesis that introduction of regulatory T cell (TREG)-inducing bacteria in SLE increases circulating TREG and the cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β, to promote improved vascular function. Specific species of bacteria will be administered to alter the gut microbiome composition and analyze the effect of increasing TREG on vascular function. Dr. Taylor’s career goal is to become an independent productive scientist with a career in academia. She hopes to continue to work to understand the relationship between the immune system and the pathophysiology of chronic diseases such as hypertension and cardiovascular disease. During the training period, Dr. Taylor will improve her laboratory skills by receiving formal training and will also improve her teaching, mentoring, and written and oral communication skills. These training activities will primarily take place at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics, which is a world-renowned research institution in the fields of hypertension and cardiovascular disease."

Intracellular bacterial pathogens such as Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of the severe pneumonia
Legionnaires' disease, are responsible for significant disease burden in the United States every year. The
growing use of immunosuppressive drugs, particularly TNF blockrs, to treat autoimmune diseases comes with a
significantly increased risk of infection by intracellular bacterial pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis
and Legionella pneumophila. The increasing numbers of individuals who are functionally immunocompromised
due to growing use of TNF blockade, combined with the growing spread of antibiotic resistance, poses a serious
public health concern. Our goal is to define the mechanisms by which TNF promotes immune defense against
Legionella pneumophila. This information may enable development of targeted therapeutics that promote anti-
bacterial defense in immunocompromised individuals. Critically, in new preliminary studies that take advantage
of our ability to dissect the interactions between Legionella and dendritic cells, we find that TNF signaling drives
a Legionella effector-triggered immune response that induces apoptosis in dendritic cells, thereby restricting
intracellular Legionella replication. The proposed studies will provide fundamental insight into how TNF-mediated
effector-triggered immunity promotes control of intracellular Legionella replication within dendritic cells. This
information may provide a basis for the development of improved therapeutics for the treatment of Legionella
and other bacterial pathogens."
10754555,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a complex inherited disorder of the heart produced
by mutation in proteins of the desmosome, such as plakophilin-2 (PKP2). Cardiac arrhythmias, and potentially
sudden death, often occur in ARVC patients during the early stages of the disease, a “concealed phase” that
presents before the onset of structural cardiomyopathy. The molecular and cellular mechanisms of these
arrhythmic events remain unclear, hindering the search for effective strategies to treat patients. My long-term
goal is to delineate the mechanisms of arrhythmia in ARVC and to identify potential drug targets to prevent
sudden cardiac death. Mice with tamoxifen (TAM)-induced ablation of PKP2 (PKP2cKO) develop a phenotype
evocative of human ARVC: a concealed stage with high incidence of arrhythmia but without structural remodeling
at 14 days, cardiomyopathy of right ventricle dominance at 21 days, and biventricular cardiomyopathy, heart
failure and death at ~42 days post-TAM. We reported that PKP2cKO hearts show significant dysregulation of
Ca2+ handling at different stages of disease progression but, most remarkably, during the concealed stage of the
disease. This proposal aims to elucidate the mechanisms underlying cardiac arrhythmia in PKP2-deficient hearts
focusing on the microdomain where Ca2+ regulation takes place. I hypothesize that dysfunction of the cardiac
ryanodine receptor (RyR2), a major intracellular Ca2+ release channel, and the ensuing Ca2+ mishandling are
critical triggers of cardiac arrhythmia in the PKP2cKO mouse and, hence, in ARVC. These aims will test my
hypothesis: 1) Determine the role of protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation in the regulation of RyR2 channel
function and calcium homeostasis. Preliminary data suggest that RyR2 is undergoing phosphorylation in
PKP2cKO hearts at Thr2810. This previously uncharacterized site is a predicted PKC substrate. I hypothesize
that PKC phosphorylation of RyR2 at Thr2810 regulates channel function and contributes to arrhythmogenic
Ca2+ release in the diseased heart. 2) Define the contribution of RyR2 dysfunction in the onset and progression
of heart disease in PKP2cKO mice. Preliminary data suggest that RyR2 phosphorylation at Thr2810 and Ser2030
is increased in ARVC. I hypothesize that inhibition of RyR2 phosphorylation at these sites prevents arrhythmia
and sudden death in PKP2cKO mice. 3) Test the efficacy of RyR2 modulators for the prevention of arrhythmia
in PKP2-deficient hearts. I hypothesize that pharmacological modulation of RyR2 is beneficial to prevent
arrhythmia in PKP2cKO mice and hearts. The completion of these aims will provide significant insight into the
regulation of RyR2 function in a model of PKP2cKO deficiency and hence shed light on the mechanisms
underlying ARVC. I anticipate these results will advance the status of RyR2 as a potential therapeutic target to
reduce the risk of arrhythmias and increase life-expectancy of patients with ARVC."

 Craniofacial skeletal deformities include mandibular retrognathism (MR), which is Class II skeletal deformity
occurring in ~5% of individuals, and mandibular prognathism (MP), which is Class III skeletal deformity occurring
in ~1% of individuals. There is an association between craniofacial skeletal deformity and TMJ disorders, with
degenerative changes in 43% of Class II and 20% of Class III deformities, but only in 3% of Class I (i.e., no
skeletal deformity). Moreover, Class II females which typically have smaller condyles, have a much higher risk
to develop TMJ dysfunction. Even though there is increasing evidence that craniofacial skeletal deformity may
be an important risk factor for the development of TMJ disorders, only studying morphological parameters has
not given any insight into a biological mechanism or a cause-effect relationship. Additionally, orthognathic
surgery can be beneficial by adjusting skeletal morphology, but its efficacy on TMJ function is poorly understood.
 Joint morphology drives biomechanics, which in turn regulates mechanobiology in joint tissue remodeling.
Identifying the mechanistic relationships between craniofacial morphology, TMJ biomechanics, and joint
mechanobiology, has led to a better understanding of the etiology and sex disparity of TMJ disorders.
Specifically, smaller condyles and shorter mandibles increase female TMJ loads, contact stresses and energy
density, while decreasing both tissue nutrient availability and cell viability, leading to pathological TMJ
remodeling. The objective of this application is to take this same integrated approach of TMJ morphology,
mechanics, and mechanobiology but in the context of Class II and III phenotypes. Our over-arching hypothesis
is that mechanical loading magnitude, as well as tissue nutrient availability and cell viability, of the TMJ are
significantly different between skeletally mature individuals with Class I, II, and III phenotypes. More specifically
we hypothesize that the TMJ in Class II females has the highest mechanical loading, lowest tissue nutrient
availability, and lowest cell viability due to disproportionally small condyle and short mandible, and that
orthognathic surgery can improve both TMJ biomechanics and mechanobiology, thus giving mechanistic insight.
We propose three specific aims (1) Determine differences in craniofacial morphology and TMJ biomechanics
between individuals with Class I, II, and III phenotypes. (2) Determine differences in TMJ mechanobiological
indicators between individuals with Class I, II, and III phenotypes. (3) Determine differences in TMJ morphology,
mechanics, mechanobiology before and after orthognathic surgery in individuals with Class II and III phenotypes.
 This project combines expertise in morphologic characterization and treatment of craniofacial deformities of
NIDCR Clinical Center intramural investigators, with the TMJ biomechanics and mechanobiology measurement
and modeling expertise of the extramural applicants. The outcomes will (i) identify clinically measurable risk
factors for TMJ disorders in skeletal deformity patients, (ii) justify the benefit of orthognathic surgery for restoring
TMJ health, and (iii) guide future patient-specific surgical planning to optimize post-op TMJ function."

The overarching goal of the proposal is to determine the structural basis for allosteric mechanisms governing
gating and modulation in pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGIC). The pLGIC superfamily governs crucial
physiological processes such as gastrointestinal functions, motor functions, and pain transmission. Aberrant
channel functions are implicated in mood disorders, addiction, chronic pain, and cancer. Currently used
therapeutic strategies suffer from our limited knowledge of the molecular details of pLGIC function, the origin of
their functional diversity, and the downstream signaling events. Using single-particle cryo-EM, we recently
solved structures of the full-length serotonin receptor (5HT3AR), a cationic pLGIC, in the resting state and two
serotonin-activated conformations. Building on this technical advancement and further biochemical
optimization, we aim to determine the conformational changes underlying gating and lipid modulation in the full-
length homomeric and heteromeric receptors within the cationic 5-HT3R and anionic glycine receptor (GlyR)
subfamilies. To achieve these goals we will use an approach that combines multidisciplinary techniques,
including cryo-EM, pulsed-EPR, and electrophysiology. Specifically, we will determine high-resolution
snapshots of pLGIC in multiple functional states, in modulator-bound conformations, in the presence of
membrane lipid constituents, and in complex with intracellular-binding proteins. These structures will be
validated and complemented with protein dynamic studies in a membrane environment and extensive functional
analysis. Taken together, our proposed work is expected to provide molecular blueprints of the channel in
physiologically relevant conformations for therapeutic targeting and unravel the molecular mechanisms
underlying channel function. These findings will, in turn, pave the way for design of novel therapeutic agents
that are safer and more effective."

Improved methods for assessing pregnancy well-being, and assessing possible molecular and genetic
correlates of poor pregnancy outcomes are currently in development. This knowledge is of limited value,
however, without the ability to intervene in troubled pregnancies. The obvious difficult step is to translate
knowledge to be gained into placental therapeutics to improve fetal health. Treating the placenta within the
pregnant mother has several significant concerns. Placental therapeutics will need to selectively target the
placenta to avoid unwanted off-target effects on maternal physiology and to ensure that treating the placenta
does not result in inadvertent negative consequences for the fetus. The long-term goal is to establish safe,
efficacious and placenta-specific gene therapy in a nonhuman primate in order to establish potential treatment
strategies for fetal growth restriction and other pregnancy pathologies in which the placenta plays a role.
Furthermore, the development of an organ-specific targeting approach in a nonhuman primate will allow the
development of other disease-specific models of pregnancy in an animal model highly translatable to human.
The overall objective of this application is to assess the feasibility and safety of a polymer-based nanoparticle
that can be taken up by the placental syncytium and result in transgene expression and allow tracking and
targeting developments for organ-specific delivery of nanocarriers. The rationale behind this proposal is that it
is expected to make significant steps toward a specific, translatable delivery mechanism for therapy in the
placenta and to broaden the capabilities of disease modelling in the nonhuman primate.
These forward-looking and innovative studies will position University of Florida and University of Wisconsin-
Madison investigators to be poised to work towards the ultimate goal, to be able to “treat the placenta”, an
ephemeral organ fundamental to our existence, yet exceedingly difficult to address with therapeutic
intervention, in the interest of improving pregnancy outcomes, women’s health and lifelong health. This study
will also open possibilities for other organ-specific disease models to be developed in the nonhuman primate."
10850806,"Project Summary. Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody disease (MOGAD) is an inflammatory
demyelinating central nervous system condition. MOGAD is a newly defined autoimmune disease that has
clinical phenotypic overlap with multiple sclerosis (MS) and aquaporin 4 (AQP4) autoantibody positive
neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), but all three conditions are now recognized as being distinct.
MOGAD is characterized by IgG1 subclass MOG-specific autoantibodies. Patients can present with visual,
motor, ambulatory, bladder, bowel and/or cognitive dysfunction. The mechanisms by which MOG autoantibodies
mediated pathology is not well understood. This is important to understand given the availability of therapeutics
that can target these autoantibody effector functions. In addition, the specific B cell subtypes that express MOG
autoantibodies have not been identified. This additional gap in our knowledge also presents consequences for
MOGAD patient treatment, given that different therapeutic B cell depletion approaches are effective against
distinct B cell subsets.
To address these gaps in our understanding of this disease we will: (i) Generate human monoclonal
MOG autoantibodies from patients; (ii) Use novel approaches to define and measure the different mechanisms
of MOG autoantibody pathogenicity. Specifically focusing on complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), given that human IgG1 antibodies include these pathogenic
mechanisms, and (iii) Perform deep single cell phenotyping on the specific B cells that express human MOG
autoantibodies.
To accomplish these aims, we have developed a unbiased high-throughput approach for producing MOG-
specific human mAbs by cloning single B cells. This approach will afford production of a diverse MOG-specific
mAb library. New approaches to study the different effector mechanisms of MOG autoantibody pathogenicity
have also been developed. Specifically, we developed high-throughput flow cytometry assays to measure
complement activity (CA), CDC, and ADCC of live cells expressing human MOG. These experiments will define
how the specificity and molecular properties of MOG autoantibodies are associated with pathogenic effector
function. Finally, we will define the phenotypes of autoantibody-producing B cell subsets using high dimensional
flow cytometry and single cell RNA sequencing approaches.
Overall, this investigation will: (i) provide a set of well-characterized human mAbs which will serve as tools for
more accurate modeling of MOGAD pathology; (ii) identify the cellular contributors to autoantibody production
(iii) and importantly for translational value, identify potential new therapeutic avenues for treating MOGAD
through specifically targeting MOG autoantibody effector functions (with complement inhibitors) and/or
production by autoreactive B cells through CD19 or CD20-mediated B cell depletion therapy."
10894637,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Male germ cells (MGCs) are precursors to spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), a stem cell population that both
self-renews and differentiates, supplying spermatozoa for the entirety of a male’s reproductive lifespan.
Disruptions in development of MGCs during fetal life leads to infertility in humans and mice. Just prior to birth,
MGCs undergo a relatively long period of cellular quiescence. This G0 arrest phase is conserved between mice
and humans and is considered an MGC reprogramming stage. During this time, MGCs lose their early GC fate
and acquire the molecular profile of SSCs by undergoing vast epigenetic modifications. Although increases in
mRNA levels of various epigenetic factors occur during G0, it is unclear how the transcripts of epigenetic factors
are regulated post-transcriptionally throughout G0. DND1 is one of many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) required
for MGC development, and it is essential for both G0 arrest and for RNA expression of epigenetic regulators
during G0. Transcript targets of DND1 during G0 include vital epigenetic regulators. Functionally, DND1 can
promote transcript degradation, protect transcripts from degradation, or promote their translation. Because DND1
has multiple regulatory roles, it is unknown how DND1 post-transcriptionally regulates its target transcripts during
G0 to ensure MGC-to-SSC development. In this proposal, how transcripts of epigenetic factors are post-
transcriptionally regulated G0 in MGCs will be determined by focusing on the translational role of DND1, as
supported by preliminary data. The central hypothesis is that an essential role of DND1 is to control when
and where its target epigenetic regulators are translated during G0 to direct the reprogramming of MGCs
into SSCs. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1, DND1-bound transcripts that encode for epigenetic regulators and
that are translated during G0 will be defined. The proteomes will be determined through LC/MS-TOF in two
stages of G0 and will be cross-referenced to previously obtained DND1-target transcripts at their respective
stages, creating DND1-directed translatomes. Epigenetic regulators in these translatomes will be assessed for
nascent translation throughout G0 to determine their temporal translational regulation. In Aim 2, it will be
determined where and how DND1 promotes the translation of its target transcripts. DND1-interacting proteins
will be unbiasedly identified and using a variety of high-end microscopy tools, the localization of DND1, its target
transcripts, and translational machinery will be determined. The insight provided by these aims will provide a
novel paradigm for how an RBP regulates the epigenetic reprogramming of MGCS to ensure the
development of SSCs. In addition to advancing scientific knowledge, this fellowship proposal also exhibits high
training potential. The training plan describes a two-year blueprint designed to strengthen technical, professional,
and conceptual skills, which will be implemented at Duke University in the laboratory of Dr. Blanche Capel.
Overall, the enclosed research strategy and training plan can develop a trainee into an independent researcher
while significantly advancing knowledge for improving reproductive health."

 COCHLEAR MECHANICS, WAVE PROPAGATION, AND COMPRESSION
 The proposed project continues a program of research that is improving our knowledge of cochlear
function through a combination of theoretical and empirical studies of fundamental processes in the peripheral
auditory system that have both basic and translational implications. The first aim addresses a theoretical issue
concerning power amplification in cochlear mechanics. It posits a mechanism for amplification in a four-
chamber cochlear model and investigates consistency with experimental observations. This aim tests
supporting evidence for the existence of a hypothetical cochlear amplifier. The second aim focuses on further
development of a method for measurement of acoustic emissions from the inner ear that are evoked by wide-
band noise stimuli. Signal processing and statistical analysis of these cochlear-reflectance measurements will
improve their sensitivity to hearing loss and improve the accuracy of their prediction of hearing threshold. The
remaining two aims of this project both utilize a cochlear-processing simulation, which is based on an existing
nonlinear model of cochlear mechanics. Through a combination of computational modeling and behavioral
measurements these aims will investigate two perceptual phenomena: consonant recognition and loudness
growth. These aims will both test the hypothesis that cochlear processing produces spectro-temporal features
that are closer to observed perception than features derived directly from the acoustic signal. Through efforts
related to all four aims, questions that possess both basic scientific interest and applied clinical relevance will
be addressed by combined application of measurement and modeling efforts."
10861932,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are revolutionizing cancer treatment, they are associated with
life- or organ-threatening complications, termed immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Steroids, the first-line
of treatment for irAEs, significantly abrogate the anti-tumor efficacy of ICIs; however, our knowledge of the
mechanisms and signs that underpin the onset and progression of irAEs is very limited. Furthermore,
commonality and individuality of altered immunity between irAEs have never been characterized. Our clinical
and translational studies have revealed significant impact of combined ICI therapy (cytotoxic T lymphocyte-
associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors) on the severity of
arthritis-irAE, -colitis-irAE, and -pneumonitis-irAE compared to PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy. Notably, T helper
(Th)17 cell signatures were significantly enhanced in arthritis-irAE synovial fluid, colitis-irAE colon, and
pneumonitis-irAE bronchoalveolar lavage. In parallel, our lab has developed arthritis-irAE, colitis-irAE and
pneumonitis-irAE murine models recapitulating patients’ clinical settings. Importantly, like in humans, Th17 cell
signatures were enriched in the inflamed tissue of mice with ICI-induced arthritis (synovium), colitis (colon),
and pneumonitis (lung) after combined ICI-therapy and correlated with irAE disease severity. Interestingly,
arthritis-prone mice developed arthritis after receiving fecal microbial transplant (FMT) from combined ICI
arthritis donor mice, notably with enhanced Th17 cell signatures. We also observed that blockade of Th17-
related cytokines, interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), may pinpoint irAE immunity while
preserving/enhancing the anti-tumor efficacy of ICI therapy in humans and mice. Further understanding of
mechanisms underlying irAEs may lead to identification of common and valid biomarkers predicting
development and/or reflecting severity of irAEs as well as to new steps in their treatment. Therefore, we
propose to uncover shared and distinct cellular/molecular mechanism(s) underpinning irAEs (arthritis-
irAE, colitis-irAE, and pneumonitis-irAE) development as well as establish efficient therapeutic
strategies. Here, in Aim 1, we will identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets by
utilizing our novel preclinical murine models of irAEs including arthritis, colitis, and pneumonitis. In addition,
cellular, phenotypic, and transcriptomic analysis of biospecimens from cancer patients with arthritis-irAE,
colitis-irAE or pneumonitis-irAE will help to uncover common or unique immunopathogenesis mechanisms
between different irAEs. In Aim 2, we will develop optimal strategies for treatment of irAEs while preserving
anti-tumor immunity by utilizing melanoma tumor model in mice with irAEs. The implications from this work will
be significant and will help to: 1) discover mechanisms universally or distinctively present in irAEs; 2) identify
mechanistic biomarkers reflecting irAE disease activity; and most importantly, 3) develop a mechanism-rooted
therapeutic strategy for irAEs without sacrificing anti-tumor immunity."
10753542,"Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Streptococcus
pneumoniae (pneumococcus) remains the most common cause of CAP in the U.S. The incidence of CAP
continues to rise contributing to increased hospitalization and mortality. A major cause of CAP is decline in
immune function in vulnerable populations. Zinc (Zn) is required for proper immune function and insufficient
dietary intake is highly prevalent within vulnerable populations. Zn deficient subjects are more susceptible to
pathogens and have a higher incidence of pneumonia whereas Zn supplementation reduces the incidence of
pneumonia. The long-term goal of this project is to determine the role of the human zinc transporter ZIP8 and
dietary Zn intake in the host immune response to pneumococcal pneumonia. Our group was the first to reveal
that ZIP8 is required for myeloid cell activation following exposure to bacteria. This is relevant because a relative
deficit of Zn, either by dietary restriction or deficits in ZIP8-mediated Zn transport, in the setting of the host
response to bacterial invasion in the lung leads to immune dysfunction, increased lung damage, and higher
mortality (see preliminary data). We hypothesize that ZIP8 plays a pivotal role in lung macrophages and dendritic
cells by maintaining favorable balance of both the innate and adaptive immune response. Accordingly, defective
Zn intake or ZIP8 function prohibits the ability of Zn to facilitate normal immune function and host defense. If
proven correct, this will have important implications on pneumonia pathogenesis and increase our capacity to
predict disease susceptibility and prevent morbidity and mortality. Guided by strong preliminary evidence, this
hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims that will: 1) Determine the impact of ZIP8 loss on the
lung myeloid landscape in vivo and its impact on pathogen clearance and host survival; 2) Determine
how ZIP8 impacts Macrophage and DC function; and 3) Determine the impact of Zn supplementation on
pneumococcal pneumonia in vivo in the setting of Zn dyshomeostasis. To accomplish our goals we have
assembled a strong and experienced team that will pursue novel studies in two novel knockout mouse models
and a model of dietary Zn restriction that will explore the role of the zinc transporter protein ZIP8 in maintaining
myeloid cell-driven immune balance in the setting pneumococcal pneumonia. At the successful completion of
this study, we will better understand the interplay between Zn homeostasis and ZIP8 in the context of
pneumococcal infection in the lung. This is expected to have a positive impact because it will reveal previously
unidentified molecular pathways that are instrumental in host defense. Further, we have the potential to identify
novel micronutrient and genetic surveillance as well as treatment strategies that will improve our ability to prevent
pneumococcal pneumonia in the most vulnerable populations worldwide. We envision that this will also lend
itself to new approaches to treat or prevent other harmful pathogens."
10873095,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Practice can improve the detection or discrimination of auditory stimuli. This process, called perceptual
learning, facilitates language acquisition and the development of musical skills, and improves speech
understanding in the hearing-impaired. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of the auditory cortex
in auditory perceptual learning, but we lack a complete understanding of the neural circuit mechanisms involved.
Corticofugal projections from the auditory cortex to subcortical auditory regions comprise a massive descending
pathway. This pathway integrates non-sensory inputs, which are essential to perceptual learning, with sensory
information and sharpens neural responses to relevant stimuli in subcortical auditory regions. Inactivation of this
corticofugal pathway also impairs learning in sensory tasks with difficult, near-threshold stimuli. Taken together,
the existing evidence suggests that corticofugal projections are well-positioned to play an important role in
perceptual learning. The core hypothesis of this proposal is that perceptual training strengthens
corticofugal modulation of activity in the ascending auditory pathway, leading to gradual enhancements
in signal detection that underlie perceptual learning. Aim 1 will use in vivo electrophysiology in freely-moving,
behaving animals to determine whether there are learning-related changes in neural activity in subcortical
auditory regions. Aim 2 will investigate whether corticofugal projections are necessary for the acquisition and/or
maintenance of training-induced improvements in perceptual sensitivity. Aim 3 will use projection-specific fiber
photometry recordings to assess if the activity of corticofugal neurons correlates with behavioral improvements
during perceptual learning. The findings from the proposed experiments will shed light on the neural circuits
underlying auditory perceptual learning and may ultimately inform strategies to improve auditory perception in
clinical populations."

Individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) suffer from complex stimulus-evoked and ongoing chronic pain that is
mediated in part by the hyperexcitability of their peripheral sensory neurons. However, how the underlying
disease pathology leads to ongoing inflammatory and neuropathic pain remains poorly understood. Over the last
decade, clinical and pre-clinical research has demonstrated that elevated heme, a key pathological feature of
SCD, may contribute to SCD pain. My preliminary data suggest that wildtype (WT) mice receiving intraplantar
injections of hemin chloride, the common salt of heme, display acute mechanical hypersensitivity and paw
attending behavior. My preliminary data further suggest that reducing the heme burden in SCD mice using
intraperitoneally administered haptoglobin, a heme scavenger, reduces mechanical hypersensitivity.
Considering these observations, I propose to investigate whether elevated heme is required for the maintenance
of pain behavior in Townes SCD. In Aim 1, I hypothesize that elevated heme causes ongoing, non-evoked
pain behavior in WT mice by dysregulation of peripheral nociception. I will administer hemin to C57BL/6
mice and conduct facial grimace and conditioned place aversion to determine the contribution of heme to non-
evoked pain behavior (Aim 1A). Following the treatment window, I will harvest the dorsal root ganglia (DRGs)
sensory neurons from these mice and use patch clamp electrophysiology to determine whether heme-induced
pain behavior is driven by peripheral neuron hyperexcitability (Aim 1B). In a parallel study, I will determine
whether acute application of hemin to cultured WT DRG neuron induces aberrant neuronal activity and if this
dependent on heme's canonical receptor, Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4) (Aim 1C). In Aim 2, I hypothesize that
chronically elevated heme is required for the maintenance of SCD pain. I will utilize evoked and non-evoked
pain behavior assays to determine whether the heme scavenger haptoglobin reduces pain behavior in Townes
SCD mice (Aim 2A). Additionally, I will use ex vivo tibial nerve fiber recordings (Aim 2B) and whole-cell patch
clamp electrophysiology (Aim 2C) to determine whether the haptoglobin reduces SCD sensory neuron
hyperexcitability and mechanical hypersensitivity in these mice. Together these aims will determine if heme
drives evoked and non-evoked pain behavior through peripheral sensitization and if heme may be targeted to
alleviated SCD chronic pain."

Blood pressure (BP)-related diseases continue to be a major public health challenge in both sexes. Men have a
higher prevalence of hypertension compared to women until about age 60, after which prevalence is greater in
women, reflecting the cardioprotective role of female sex hormones. The high incidence of hypertension in adults
is associated with high dietary sodium intake. Thus, investigating sex differences in responses to sodium may
be important in understanding these health disparities between men and women. Central sodium sensing is
critical in mediating neurohormonal responses to the relative hypernatremia associated with high salt intake. The
circumventricular organs (CVOs), including the organum vasculosum lamina terminalis (OVLT) and subfornical
organ (SFO), lack a complete blood brain barrier and contain osmosensitive neurons capable of sensing changes
in sodium concentration in the blood. The CVOs also mediate sodium-induced changes in sympathetic nerve
activity (SNA), vasopressin (AVP), thirst, and BP. Studies in humans show increased activation of the CVOs
during acute hypernatremia (hypertonic saline infusion), which is similar to the underappreciated relative
hypernatremia that occurs with high sodium intake. However, no human studies have investigated whether there
are sex differences in central neural activation during acute hypernatremia. Therefore, the focus of this proposal
is to investigate sex differences in functional connectivity of sodium sensing brain regions (SFO, OVLT) and
brain regions involved in sympathetic outflow (rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), nucleus tractus solitarius
(NTS), caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM)) during acute hypernatremia (via hypertonic saline infusion) using
blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI. We will also assess whether these responses are associated with
changes in AVP, norepinephrine (NE), thirst, and BP. This proposal involves 2 specific aims: aim 1 will assess
sex differences in change in functional connectivity between sodium sensing brain regions (SFO, OVLT); aim 2
will assess sex differences in change in functional connectivity between sympathoregulatory brain regions
(RVLM, NTS, CVLM). We hypothesize that acute hypernatremia will increase functional connectivity between
sodium sensing brain regions (Aim 1) and increase connectivity with the RVLM and decrease connectivity with
the NTS and CVLM (Aim 2). We hypothesize that men will have greater responses since (1) in salt sensitive
rodent models, male animals display larger changes in arterial BP; (2) men have greater AVP release in response
to hypertonic saline infusion; and (3) men have greater MSNA, BP, and forebrain BOLD fMRI responses to
various cardiovascular stressors. This proposal has the potential to offer important insight into sex-specific
mechanisms of BP regulation and fluid balance and will provide the trainee with specific instruction in BOLD
fMRI and technical writing, which are critical in his development into a productive research scientist."

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) affects over 26 million people worldwide, yet the treatment options are limited. This
is in large part due to the unclear molecular mechanisms underlying AD. Genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) have identified genomic regions that are associated with AD, but determining the exact causal variants
and genes remains a major challenge. Recent developments in high throughput genomic technologies have
incredible potential to functionally characterize these causal features, but must be applied to the correct cell
types. Neurons, astrocytes, and microglia are all thought to play key roles in the etiology of AD but obtaining
viable primary human brain cells for these experiments is understandably very difficult. Therefore, recent
protocols to rapidly differentiate human induced pluripotent stem cells into various brain cell types offer great
promise as tools to decipher the genetic basis of AD and guide future therapeutic efforts.
The goal of this project is to identify which AD risk variants alter transcriptional regulatory capacity in human
brain cells and to map them to the genes they regulate. To understand which variants are functional in microglia,
astrocytes, and neurons, I will perform massively parallel reporter assays in human induced pluripotent stem
cells (hiPSCs) differentiated into each cell type (Aim 1). To identify AD risk genes, I will use publicly available
Hi-C, ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq in hiPSC-derived microglia, astrocytes, and neurons to link variants to genes
(Aim 2A). I will functionally validate a selection of putative variant-gene pairs with CRISPR inhibition (Aim 2B).
The results of this work will identify cell-type specific causal variants, and the genes that they regulate. This
will have a positive impact because understanding exactly which genes are involved in which cell types in AD
will elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the disease etiology. The genes identified in this study can act as
targets for future studies and candidates for therapeutic design."

My long-term professional goal is to study rare human inherited diseases with an emphasis on: (1) defining
disease mechanisms and developing therapeutics; and (2) increasing research and awareness through
participating in science policy. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) are essential enzymes that charge tRNA
with cognate amino acids in the cytoplasm and mitochondria; 17 of the 37 nuclear-encoded ARSs act
exclusively in the mitochondria. All 17 mitochondrial ARSs have been implicated in human recessive
diseases with a broad range of clinical phenotypes, often affecting tissues with high energy demands.
Interestingly, certain mitochondrial ARSs cause variable tissue-specific effects, which can depend on the
specific genetic variants that a patient carries. One important example of this observation is mitochondrial
seryl-tRNA synthetase (SARS2), which has been implicated in disease phenotypes ranging from progressive
spastic paresis to HUPRA syndrome (Hyper Uricemia, Pulmonary hypertension, Renal failure in infancy, and
Alkalosis). Currently, there are no genetic or molecular explanations for this clinical heterogeneity.
Furthermore, the number of known pathogenic variants is limited, resulting in a large gap in our knowledge of
the allelic heterogeneity in SARS2-related disease. I will pursue two specific aims to address these issues.
Under Aim 1, I will perform massively parallel cell growth assays on all possible variants in the SARS2 open
reading frame to assess the functional consequences of each variant. These studies will be performed in
haploid (Hap1) cells that harbor: (a) a randomly integrated, 1xFLAG-tagged, doxycycline-inducible wild-type
copy of SARS2; and (b) an endogenous SARS2 null allele. I will transduce these cells with lentiviral libraries
containing all possible SARS2 variants and will quantitate the frequencies of each allele (via next-generation
sequencing) in the presence of doxycycline (i.e., in the presence of wild-type SARS2-1xFLAG) and in the
absence of doxycycline (i.e., in the absence of SARS2-1xFLAG). Variants that are reduced in frequency after
doxycycline removal will be classified as loss-of-function alleles. Under Aim 2, I will generate clonal Hap1
cell lines that carry individual, known pathogenic SARS2 variants that are associated with distinct clinical
phenotypes (i.e., progressive spastic paresis versus HUPRA syndrome). These cell lines will contain an
integrated, inducible SARS2-1xFLAG that can be used to maintain cell viability. I will employ these cell lines
to assess the effect of each variant on protein translation, mitochondrial function, and interactions with
potential SARS2 binding partners. Overall, these studies will: (a) reveal essential regions of the SARS2
protein toward a better understanding of enzyme biology; (b) provide a complete panel of loss-of-function
SARS2 variants toward rapid patient diagnosis; and (c) provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of
SARS2-related disease toward defining genotype:phenotype correlations and developing therapeutics."

Astrocytes are glial cells involved in the regulation of neuronal synaptic formation, maturation, and plasticity. The
period in development when neural circuits are shaped by experience is termed the critical period. In the visual
critical period, the development of normal vision depends on proper visual input. This period is characterized by
increased plasticity, whereas in adulthood plasticity is decreased and changes to the circuitry are restricted.
Plasticity alterations have been shown to contribute to neurological diseases, such as glioma and schizophrenia.
Astrocytes secrete different proteins that induce synapse formation or maturation, in an age-dependent manner.
Experience-induced neuronal activity elicits transcriptional changes in astrocytes in the visual cortex, including
the expression of immediate early gene c-fos. Fos, the c-fos coded protein, acts as a transcription factor and it
has been shown to have cell-type specific targets. In astrocytes, c-fos expression is induced upon visual stimulus
in the visual cortex. Further, astrocytes upregulate c-fos mRNA throughout development and into adulthood, and
c-fos is downregulated when visual input is decreased. Previous findings have shown age- and experience-
dependent astrocyte transcriptional changes; however, the astrocyte upstream regulators of these gene
expression changes remain poorly understood. I hypothesize that astrocytes regulate experience-dependent
plasticity through the expression of Fos and its subsequent regulation of astrocyte-specific late response genes
leading to synapse stabilization. With my dissertation, I will elucidate the regulation of astrocyte experience-
dependent transcriptional changes via Fos, and its modulatory effect on plasticity, i.e., synapse stabilization in
the adult visual cortex. Preliminary data in Aim 1 suggest Fos is an experience-dependent and upstream
transcriptional regulator of astrocytes’ response to neuronal activity. These data demonstrate my expertise on
molecular techniques, bioinformatics, and mouse surgery. A functional approach that answers whether Fos
deletion in astrocytes results in increased plasticity in the adult visual cortex, will further elucidate its role as an
experience-dependent astrocyte transcriptional regulator. For the F99 phase, I propose in vivo imaging to assess
the functional effects of Fos deletion in astrocytes. For the K00 phase, I will focus on disease models to assess
how astrocyte transcriptional dysregulation results in functional and plasticity alterations that contribute to
disease. The carefully designed training plan targets gaps in my scientific training and professional development
that will ultimately allow me to advance confidently toward my goal of becoming an independent principal
investigator and mentor leading a research team. I will work with my Sponsors to continue acquiring the proposed
skills, and to enable me to find the right environment and mentors to further my career and reach my goal."

Early environmental exposures are strongly implicated in the development of later diseases. The early life
microbiome provides a developmental context for understanding health and disease across the life course. In
the modern era, mothers and children routinely encounter microbiome perturbing exposures including cesarean
section, infant formula, and antibiotics during pregnancy and in the child's first year after birth. Compelling basic
science and epidemiological research from our group and others shows that perturbation of the pre-conception,
prenatal, and early childhood microbiome contributes to adverse health outcomes. These connections are
particularly strong for upper and lower airway health. Population-based studies document associations between
asthma and early antibiotic exposure, and children with asthma have distinct microbiome signatures from
unaffected children. Complementary mouse models show a causal association between perturbed microbiota
and airway disease. However, key knowledge gaps remain. First, existing studies lack diversity and are often
underpowered to evaluate the extent to which microbiome-perturbing exposures such as medication use,
cesarean section, and infant formula underlie racial/ethnic disparities in outcomes such as the higher prevalence
of asthma in Black and Hispanic children compared to White children. Second, few studies have examined the
microbiome across critical time windows (preconception, pregnancy, delivery, infancy, and early childhood).
ECHO provides a unique opportunity to address these gaps and study the developmental role of the early life
microbiome in later health in a large, diverse U.S. cohort. We will recruit 500 pregnant people and their resulting
offspring from Middlesex County, NJ, one of the most diverse counties in the U.S., into the national ECHO cohort.
Our proposed scientific focus is on the early life microbiome and exposure to microbiome-perturbing exposures
(cesarean section, infant formula, and medication use) in relation to upper and lower airway health. Our specific
aims are to: (1) Characterize social determinants and racial/ethnic disparities in common microbiome-perturbing
exposures during critical early life periods in the ECHO-wide cohort and evaluate associations with longitudinal
microbiome structures in mothers and children; (2) Estimate associations between microbiome-perturbing
exposures and child outcomes, with a focus on upper and lower airway health; (3) Recruit 500 pregnant
participants reflecting the unique diversity of Middlesex County, NJ; and (4) (Exploratory) Examine the extent to
which maternal microbiome perturbation in the 12 months before conception is associated with adverse upper
and lower airway outcomes in children. The addition of NJ contributes unique diversity to the ECHO consortium.
In turn, our team's ECHO-wide research at a national scale will yield knowledge that informs clinical and public
health interventions that promote a “healthy” microbiome and improve child health."

Tumor-intrinsic factors in cancer cells modulate the immune milieu to enable prolonged survival and growth of
tumors. In breast cancer (BC), the 2nd leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women, molecular subtyping of
these factors effectively guides targeted therapies, but does not guide immunotherapy approaches as immune
infiltrates vary significantly within each subtype. The presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is highly
prognostic for survival and therapeutic benefit in BC, but the tumor-intrinsic factors governing their presence are
not well defined. Using TCGA RNA analysis, I have identified loss of function in the transcriptional repressor
REST as being a key correlate to reduced lymphocyte infiltration into tumors of multiple BC molecular subtypes.
Loss of functional REST in BC (~15-20% of tumors) is associated with poorer prognoses, however, the
mechanisms by which loss of REST function modulates the tumor immune microenvironment are not known and
may provide novel targets for enhancing therapeutic responses. I recently generated a murine Rest knockout
BC line (Rest-less) and my in vivo studies confirmed that Rest-less tumors contain significantly less lymphocytes
while also revealing a significant increase in pro-tumor macrophages, a cell population our lab has identified as
being key modulators of lymphocyte suppression in BC. Furthermore, my in vitro studies identified
lymphangiogenic Vegfc and Vegfd among the most differentially upregulated genes in Rest-less BC cells. Tumor
lymphangiogenesis is linked to T cell suppression in solid tumors and may provide a reason for Rest-mediated
suppression of lymphocytes. Based on my preliminary data, I hypothesize that lymphocyte suppression in Rest-
less tumors is orchestrated by the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and lymphatic
endothelium to a suppressive phenotype. I propose two specific aims to test my hypothesis. In Aim 1, I will
determine the role of tumor intrinsic Rest on TAM-mediated lymphocyte suppression using co-culture assays of
TAMs from Rest-less tumors together with lymphocytes in vitro and macrophage depletion through anti-CSF-1R
treatment in an antigen-specific (GFP; JEDI) Rest-less model in vivo. In Aim 2, I will evaluate how Vegfr3, the
receptor for Vegfc and Vegfd, regulates the REST-less tumor microenvironment and responsiveness to
immunotherapy. To accomplish this task, I will test anti-Vegfr3 blockade on Rest-less tumors with or without anti-
PD1 and comprehensively analyze tumor growth, lymphatic depletion, and immune responses using RNAseq,
spectral cytometry, and cyclic immunofluorescence. Our proposed research will provide an understanding of a
previously uncharacterized facet of REST-mediated immune suppression in BC and will use novel murine
orthotopic models to test strategies that block immune suppressive mechanisms. Ultimately, I anticipate my
findings will reveal targetable mechanism(s) to inhibit Rest-mediated immunosuppression in BC and provide a
considerable impact on the treatment of REST-less tumors overall."

Neuroblastoma is a cancer derived from the developing sympathetic nervous system and is the most commonly
diagnosed extracranial solid tumor of childhood. Despite an intensive treatment regimen of chemotherapy,
surgery, radiation, and immunotherapy, the five-year survival rate of high-risk neuroblastoma patients remains
at only 50%. The low tumor mutational burden of neuroblastoma has challenged the development of targeted-
and immuno-therapies, however moderate success has been achieved by targeting GD2 with monoclonal
antibody therapy, credentialing immunotherapeutic treatment strategies for neuroblastoma as a promising
approach. The success of GD2-targeted therapy to date has been hindered due to debilitating side effects from
on-target/off-tumor toxicity since GD2 is also expressed on pain fibers, and antigen loss as a mechanism of
therapy resistance. Therefore, there is an unmet need for the discovery of new therapeutic targets in
neuroblastoma. B7-H3, encoded by the CD276 gene, is a type 1 transmembrane protein in the B7 family of
immunoregulatory proteins and is highly expressed in many adult and pediatric cancers, including
neuroblastoma. In addition to being implicated in immunoinhibition, B7-H3 may also mediate tumor migration
and metastasis. Preclinical success of several immunotherapeutic strategies directed toward B7-H3, including
CAR-T cells and antibody drug conjugates, suggest that B7-H3 is a targetable tumor-associated antigen with
several pediatric clinical trials ongoing or planned. Therefore, it is critical to understand the oncogenic functions
of B7-H3 and how its expression is regulated to anticipate mechanisms of therapy resistance. Our central
hypothesis is that B7-H3 promotes neuroblastoma metastasis and immune evasion, and its expression is
regulated by tumor microenvironment-derived cytokines and neuroblastoma-specific transcription factors. Our
preliminary data shows that B7-H3 knockdown using CRISPRi in neuroblastoma cell lines inhibits cellular
proliferation. Additionally, ChIP-sequencing data identifies regions of MYC and MYCN binding at the B7-H3
promoter indicating a potential role of the MYC transcription factors in regulating B7-H3 expression. B7-H3
expression may also be regulated by inflammatory cytokines, as neuroblastoma cell lines upregulate B7-H3
expression following TNF-α or TGF-β exposure. Finally, recombinant human B7-H3 inhibits T cell activation,
TNF-α, and IFN-y. Uncovering how B7-H3 promotes immune evasion in neuroblastoma is crucial given the T
and NK cell-based immunotherapies undergoing clinical testing. We propose that B7-H3 is a multifunctional
protein that serves as a promising therapeutic target in neuroblastoma. This NRSA F31 will define the
mechanisms of neuroblastoma dependance on B7-H3 for metastasis and immune evasion, while also defining
mechanisms of overexpression, to inform future B7-H3-targeting therapies and ultimately improve outcomes for
patients with high-risk neuroblastoma."

At the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ), repetitive stimulation has been shown to induce various
forms of protein synthesis-dependent plasticity, including growth of immature “ghost” boutons and potentiation
of miniature excitatory junction potential (mEJP) frequency. There is a concurrent increase in
calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) protein abundance, which is required for plasticity.
The molecular mechanisms of this increase in CaMKII are not well understood, and previous studies
examining this effect did not differentiate between the presynaptic and postsynaptic sides of the NMJ. The
Drosophila NMJ has a wide variety of genetic tools to separate the motoneuron and muscle, making it an ideal
model for separating presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms. Preliminary data indicate that after spaced
depolarization with a high potassium solution, CaMKII levels increase in both the presynaptic and postsynaptic
sides of the NMJ. Additionally, this increase was blocked by application of cycloheximide, a translation
inhibitor, indicating that CaMKII accumulation is dependent on protein synthesis and is unlikely to be due to
protein translocation or transport. The goal of this research proposal is to identify the molecular mechanisms
and localization of CaMKII synthesis on both sides of the synapse. In the first part of Aim 1, GFP reporter
constructs will be used to determine the sequences in the CaMKII 3’UTR that are required for activity-
dependent translation. In the second part of Aim 1, the trans-acting proteins that bind to the UTR will be
identified using RNA affinity purification. The results from these experiments will elucidate the specific cis- and
trans-acting factors that are required for activity-dependent CaMKII protein synthesis, and determine whether
similar mechanisms act pre- and post-synaptically. In Aim 2, Flp-Frt recombination will be used to delete either
the CaMKII catalytic domain or the 3’UTR and the effect on potentiation of mEJP frequency will be determined.
The excision of the domains will be done exclusively in the presynaptic or postsynaptic compartment, so that
the contribution of either the motoneuron or muscle can be clearly separated. In Aim 3, the subcellular
localization of newly-synthesized CaMKII will be compared to that of pre-existing CaMKII. The function of this
newly-synthesized CaMKII pool is unknown, and this experiment will determine whether the newly-synthesized
CaMKII is targeted to a distinct subcellular nanodomain. Ultimately, this research plan will clarify how
compartment-specific CaMKII synthesis may be contributing to long-term functional changes in the synapse
and may identify new avenues of research into CaMKII-dependent plasticity. While conducting this research,
in-depth training will be provided in a variety of crucial skills, including research design, statistical analysis,
communication skills, super-resolution microscopy, and image analysis."

Hypertension remains a leading contributor to cardiovascular disease-related morbidity and mortality
in the United States. Older (i.e., ≥60 y) women are one group more likely to develop hypertension with
inadequate blood pressure (BP) control, despite optimal drug regimens. Older women are also at a
greater risk for the development of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias which are exacerbated
by hypertension. Accordingly, the prevalence of hypertension and ineffectiveness of drug treatments
alone signal the need for non-pharmacological approaches to supplement standard care for BP control
in this population. One such approach to achieve this is “heat therapy.” Recent studies have revealed
the promising benefits of heat therapy on vascular health, autonomic activity, and cardiac function,
which may ultimately reduce BP and the risk for cardiovascular diseases. These physiological adapta-
tions may also translate to improvements in cognitive function through improved cerebrovascular func-
tion and health. However, no information exists regarding the efficacy of heat therapy to reduce BP,
induce meaningful neural-cardiovascular adaptations, and improve cognition in older women. The
overall goals of this proposal will be to 1) identify changes in autonomic BP regulation and 2)
assess alterations in cerebrovascular and cognitive function in older women with mild hyper-
tension following 8 weeks of at-home heat therapy. Specific Aim 1 will investigate chronic lower leg
heat therapy's impact on BP control and neural-cardiovascular function in older, hypertensive women
using intervention and control groups. The intervention group will perform 8 weeks of at-home lower
leg heat therapy using hot water immersion up to the knee (42°C, 45 min/session, 4 sessions/week).
The control group will complete the same sessions with thermoneutral water (35°C). We will assess
24-hour ambulatory BP, sympathetic vascular transduction, cardiac function, and heat shock protein
expression before and after the interventional period. Specific Aim 2 will measure cerebral hemody-
namics and cognitive function responses to chronic lower leg heat therapy in older, hypertensive
women. We will use transcranial Doppler ultrasound to assess cerebrovascular function and autoreg-
ulation before and after 8 weeks of lower leg heat therapy. Further, we will use the NIH Toolbox Cog-
nitive Battery to assess different cognitive function domains. To maximize the clinical relevance of this
project and my scientific training, I have assembled a strong interdisciplinary research team comprised
of Qi Fu, MD, PhD, Rong Zhang, PhD, Steven Romero, PhD, Heidi Rossetti, PhD, and Satyam Sarma,
MD. This team will help me complete the proposed project and master several technical skills (e.g.,
microneurography, echocardiography, biomolecular assays), while improving my ability to obtain extra-
mural research funding (e.g., NIH K99/R00) and become a successful independent clinical researcher."

Society faces increasing burden from respiratory immune challenge including respiratory viral infection.
Respiratory viral infection, including with influenza A virus, can cause changes in brain function; understanding
the link between lung and brain health is critical to anticipating the shifting health needs of our society. The lung
and brain engage in bidirectional communication through several signaling mechanisms, allowing these organs
to influence each other. It is unknown how lung-brain communication impacts the progression of respiratory viral
infection, or how different communication mechanisms are prioritized as inflammatory response progresses.
Using a mouse model of infection with influenza A strain PR8, this proposal explores immune signaling in the
bidirectional lung-brain axis. The overarching goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that the lung and
brain exert bidirectional influence during respiratory infection, altering each other’s immune states. My
preliminary data shows that during PR8 infection, changes in central nervous system (CNS) occur prior to
inflammatory gene upregulation in lung tissue. The signaling mechanisms influencing these rapid CNS changes
in neuronal activity, as well as the role of this CNS response on infection progression, remain unknown.
Pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) are sensory cells which mount an immune response during respiratory
inflammatory challenge. These cells are also the only cells in the lung epithelium directly innervated by the vagus
nerve. Despite the known immune function of both PNECs and the vagus nerve, the role of PNECs signaling to
the CNS during a respiratory infection remains unstudied. In Aim 1, I will explore the role of PNEC signaling in
infection by characterizing molecular and vagal signaling from these cells during infection. I will then ablate these
cells prior to PR8 infection using a cre-dependent AAV delivery mechanism in calcacre mice to determine whether
their signaling contributes to the peripheral or CNS response to infection. Regardless of signaling mechanisms
initiating the rapid CNS response to PR8 infection, the ultimate consequence of this response is unknown.
Neuronal ensembles can encode immune memory, impacting the immune states of peripheral organs. In Aim 2,
I will determine how neuronal activity influences the microglial and peripheral immune response throughout PR8
infection onset. Using high-throughput imaging and a machine learning analysis pipeline, I will map the neuronal
and microglial response to PR8 infection in TRAP2::TdTom mice. I will then explore the role of neuronal activity
by capturing and later re-activating the neuronal population active during PR8 infection using TRAP2::hM3Dq
mice. I will characterize microglial response in CNS tissue and peripheral immune response to determine if
activity of the PR8-responsive neuronal population is sufficient to drive immune outcomes. Altogether, this
proposal will explore the connection between lung and brain health, focusing on these organs’ influence on each
other’s immune states in the onset of respiratory infection."
10923839,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Despite its critical role in meal cessation, the neuroendocrine mechanisms underlying sensory-specific
satiety (SSS) are largely unknown. SSS is the transient reduction in motivation and pleasantness for a recently
consumed food. While this selective decrease in hedonic value suppresses consumption of the same food, in
leads to a comparative increase in the reward value of uneaten palatable foods. As a result, a variety of readily
available alternative foods can drive overconsumption. Given the variety of highly caloric foods pervasive in the
modern environment, it is important to understand the mechanisms by which SSS regulates food intake. To this
end, we propose to use our novel rat model of SSS to investigate the neural action of one satiation signal,
glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Indeed, our preliminary data indicate GLP-1 receptors (GLP-1Rs) in the
hindbrain are critical for the SSS-induced decline in consumption of the same food. Moreover, hindbrain GLP-
1Rs are sufficient to prevent the overconsumption of an available alternative food. These data show hindbrain
GLP-1 signaling is important for decreased consumption of the same food. In contrast, the effects of GLP-1
signaling is muted during the comparative increased intake of an alternative available food.
 However, these data unearth additional questions regarding the neural underpinnings of SSS. Notably, the
neural population(s) mediating this GLP-1 signaling are unknown. An integrator of peripheral signals, the nucleus
tractus solitarius (NTS) of the caudal brainstem is well-positioned to host the GLP-1 signaling involved in SSS.
Not only does the NTS contain GLP-1R-expressing cells, but it also holds preproglucagon (PPG) neurons that
synthesize GLP-1. Therefore, in Aim I, we propose to investigate the role of these two distinct NTS neural
populations in controlling SSS.
 Furthermore, it is unclear how the effects of GLP-1 signaling are muted to enable the increased intake of
an alternative food. Two subcortical structures, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the central
amygdala (CeA) are functionally and anatomically suited to modulate GLP-1 signaling. Both regions mediate
aspects of ingestive behavior and reward, and each region projects directly to PPG NTS neurons. Thus, in Aim
II we will characterize the role of BNST/CeA → PPG projections during increased intake of an alternative food.
 Considering the ever-growing prevalence of obesity in the United States, understanding how neuroendocrine
signals mediate the impact of recent food experiences on consumption is an important step in the development
of approaches for treating diseases of maladaptive ingestive behavior. To this end, our experiments will
investigate central GLP-1-mediated mechanisms by which SSS modulates food intake."

10749949,"PROJECT SUMMARY P/F Program
The objectives of Pilot and Feasibility (P/F) Program are to provide a mechanism for enhancing interdisciplinary
research projects for junior faculty and to promote career development in digestive diseases. Since 1999, 56/58
awards have been to investigators at the Assistant Professor level or more junior (Track 1), and 14/15 since
2013. Since 1999, the P/F Program has an overall Return on Investment (ROI) of 58:1. We have established
a detailed and rigorous peer-review process to select the most meritorious proposals from applicants with the
greatest potential. We assure constructive and interactive feedback through email, phone and face-to-face
discussions and meetings with all the applicants prior to application and written critiques following review. We
receive 9-15 applications each year, with 4-5 funded following internal and external review with final priority
assigned by our External Advisory Board. SPECIFIC AIMS The Program is advertised and promoted within the
Washington University community with two key objectives: Aim 1: To provide funds that spur creative
proposals that help faculty establish independent, extramurally funded programs in digestive disease
research, facilitate expansion of the Research Base, and attract new ideas to the field of digestive
disease as a whole. Aim 2: To provide a crucial mechanism to promote career development of new
investigators, particularly emerging junior faculty (Track 1). The WU-DDRCC P/F Program funds junior
investigators at a critical juncture in their career when preliminary data could mean the difference between
successful extramural funding and building a career in GI research vs. pursuing either non-GI research or other
career goals entirely. ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND HIGHLIGHTS. Between 2003-18 (15 P/F cycles), we
funded 43 investigators with total investment of $1,551,372 (average: $36,078/award). Those P/F
Awardees in turn have received $59.8M in total direct costs for an ROI of 39:1. Our ROI for the last cycle
(2013-18) is 26:1. 95% of our P/F Awardees are still engaged in full-time academic research, with 72% (31/43)
obtaining subsequent independent funding (33 R01, 6 R21, 4 R03, 6 K awards (1 K01, 2 K23, 4 K08), 3 ACS).
P/F funding has led to our P/F Awardees publishing numerous high impact publications in Science (Lora Hooper),

the last renewal, P/F Awardees have come from a diverse set of departmental backgrounds: Medicine (GI,
Oncology, Hematology, Infectious Disease, Nutrition, Cardiology, Endocrinology Divisions), Pediatrics (GI,
Rheumatology), Pathology & Immunology, Developmental Biology, Genetics, Obstetrics & Gynecology."
10885932,"ABSTRACT. Black women in the United States are three to four times more likely to die from pregnancy-
related causes than White women, a disparity that has persisted for the past five decades. Gestational
diabetes (GDM) and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) disproportionately develop in the pregnancies
of Black women and negatively impact cardiometabolic health in the years following pregnancy. Gendered
racism, a hybrid phenomenon of racism and sexism that interlocks to create a unique form of oppression, is a
chronic stressor experienced by Black women and contributes to ongoing health disparities. However, the
empirical evidence on the health implications of gendered racism is still nascent. Psychological resilience has
been found to protect against adverse pregnancy outcomes, yet Black women benefit less from such resilience
assets. A more culturally relevant understanding of resilience incorporating the individual-level (psychological
resilience and spirituality) and family-level (family support) will be explored in this study. The overall purpose
of this study is to examine the relationships between gendered racism experiences, resilience, and high-risk
pregnancies among Black women. Data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health will
be used to assess experiences of gendered racism, high-risk pregnancy, and resilience among Black women
with at least one pregnancy (N = 2,153). The aims are to: Aim 1. Identify latent subgroups of women with
different gendered racism experiences determined by four indicators (structural sexism, interpersonal sexism,
structural racism, and interpersonal racism). Aim 2. Determine the relationship of history of a high-risk
pregnancy (GDM/HDP, cases vs controls) with gendered racism experiences characterizing the identified
latent subgroups, covarying for chronic hypertension, diabetes (type 1 or 2), body mass index, level of
education, and income. Aim 3. Describe the association of history of a high-risk pregnancy and gendered
racism experiences with sources of resilience (individual and family) during adulthood, covarying for chronic
hypertension, diabetes (type 1 or 2), body mass index, level of education, and income. Latent profile analysis
will be used to identify subgroups for Black women with different gendered racism experiences. Bivariate and
covariate-adjusted multinominal logistic regression approach will be used to determine the association
between high-risk pregnancy and gendered racism subgroup experiences. Covariate-adjusted multiple
regression will be conducted to examine the relationship of high-risk pregnancy and gendered racism subgroup
experiences with resilience. This study uses an innovative methodological approach that integrates both
interpersonal and structural gendered racism to quantity the multifaceted nature of oppression experienced by
Black women along with a culturally relevant conceptualization of resilience. The findings will enhance the
understanding of the health consequences of gendered racism and inform future research on multi-level
interventions to combat systemic inequalities and foster resilience."
10890879,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There has been little or no long-term improvement in outcomes for patients with treatment-refractory acute
myeloid leukemia (AML). The recently developed image-guided radiation strategy, total marrow and lymphoid
irradiation (TMLI) delivers high radiation doses to major leukemia reservoirs while sparing normal tissues.
Although TMLI prior to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) improved patients’ 2-year overall
survival (OS) rate from <10% to 48%, relapses remained common. Such radiation resistance is a consequence
of both intrinsic cancer cell properties and the extrinsic influence of the tumor microenvironment. It was previously
demonstrated that radiation-induced cell death causes the release of danger signals recruiting Toll-like Receptor-
9 (TLR9)-positive myeloid cells, which jump-start tumor vascularization and regrowth. These cancer-promoting,
rather than immunostimulatory, effects are mediated by TLR9-mediated secretion of cytokines such as IL-6,
thereby leading to activation of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3). STAT3 is a
multifaceted oncogene and a central immune checkpoint regulator operating in AML cells as well as in tumor-
associated myeloid cells in patients. However, it remains an elusive target, with no FDA-approved direct small
molecule STAT3 inhibitors. To overcome this challenge, we previously developed a strategy to deliver
oligonucleotide STAT3 inhibitors, such as siRNA or decoy DNA, specifically into commonly TLR9-positive AML
and normal myeloid cells. The nuclease-resistant, second-generation CpG-STAT3 decoy inhibitor (CSI-2)
injected intravenously showed efficacy in targeting STAT3, suppressing leukemia cell survival and/or inducing
immune responses against moderate burden of human and mouse AML in vivo. The hypothesis is that combining
the immunostimulatory CSI-2 strategy with conditioning TMLI treatments will improve treatment efficacy against
AML even at high burden (>50% leukemic blasts in the bone marrow) by providing time for the generation of
adaptive T-cell driven immune responses. The preliminary results demonstrated that the TMLI regimen can
improve uptake of CSI-2 by AML, thereby reducing leukemia-initiating potential, augmenting AML
immunogenicity, and thereby inducing potent CD8+ T cell-mediated antileukemic immune responses. We
propose to: 1. elucidate the molecular mechanisms of TMLI/CSI-2 effect on AML cell differentiation; 2. optimize
TMLI to maximize the effect on leukemic bone marrow vascular structure, CSI-2 delivery, leukemogenic
potential, and immunogenicity; 3. assess the efficacy and cellular mode-of-action of the TMLI/CSI-2 combination
treatment compared to either treatment alone in human or mouse AML models in humanized or syngeneic mice,
respectively. The overarching goal of this interdisciplinary proposal is to produce a clinically relevant, effective,
and safe combinatorial radiation-immunotherapy for patients with relapsed/recurrent AML, representing the
highest unmet need in cancer therapy."
10885170,"Project Summary / Abstract. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell-based immunotherapy has
shown curative potential in patients with haematological malignancies. However, it faces significant safety issues
(e.g., cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity) and efficacy loss arising from tonic signaling and T cell
exhaustion. These undesireable features are more or less decoded in the distal end of lymphocyte activation
pathway, the two-component Calcium Release-Activated Calcium (CRAC) channel composed of stromal
interaction molecule (STIM) and ORAI to form a major Ca2+ entry route in T cells and control T cell activation.
Upon T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement, Ca2+ depletion in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is sensed by stromal
interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) to initiate a series of conformational changes, culminating in the activation of the
pore-forming subunit of the CRAC channel, ORAI1. Ca2+ influx induces a series of processes in T cells, including
the secretion of cytolytic granules and the activation of Ca2+-dependent enzymes, including calcineurin, CaMKII
and Erk1/2, as well as master transcription factors, such as NF-κB and nuclear factor of activated-T cells (NFAT),
that are essential for adaptive immunity. Most importantly, nuclear translocated NFAT differentially engages its
binding partners to promote the activation, differentiation, anergy/exhaustion, and effector functions of various T
cell subsets. Notably, tonic signaling and exhaustion observed in CAR-T cell therapy are associated with
hyperactive Ca2+/NFAT signaling. Till now, no FDA-approved CRAC channel blockers are in hand to modulate
the CRAC channel for therapeutic applications. There remains, therefore, a critical need to exploit novel
interventional approaches by targeting the distal CRAC channels in T cells. Unlike most existing studies centered
on CAR per se or the proximal signaling components in modulating CAR-T cell activation pathway, this project
focuses on engineering the distal end of lymphocyte activation pathway without any modifications to the chimeric
antigen receptor or proximal TCR signaling. The m-PIs propose to to develop a suite of genetically-encoded
CRAC channel Blockers (CRAB) that can be precisely controlled by light or drugs (LiCRAB for Aim 1, and
DiCRAB for Aim 2, respectively), thereby conferring tight control of T cell activity to fine-tune T cell efficacy and
mitigate CAR-T cell tonic signaling and/or exhaustion. The successful execution of this project will explore
innovative immunoengineering approaches to accelerate the design of intelligent cell-based therapies for human
disease. Mechanistically, the tools can be utilized to probe the kinetic requirement of Ca2+/NFAT signaling during
CAR-T cell activation. From a translational perspective, we will generate broadly-applicable genetically-encoded
tools for therapeutic T cell functional tuning, which hold great promise to overcome tonic signaling / exhaustion,
and curtail cytokine storm associated with existing FDA-approved CAR T-cell therapies."

Complex musculoskeletal trauma is common both in combat and high energy civilian accidents and often leads
to prolonged disability or skeletal nonunion. Regenerative rehabilitation is an emerging field with the potential to
improve functional outcomes for lower limb musculoskeletal trauma patients. Our overall objectives are to (i)
investigate rehabilitative loading as a regenerative rehabilitation treatment strategy for severe complex
musculoskeletal trauma and (ii) understand the relationship between rehabilitative loading, local regenerative
niche mechanics, and the biological response. We will meet these objectives through the following specific aims.
Specific Aim 1: Determine the effects of rehabilitative loading, injury severity and sex on regenerative
niche mechanical signals and functional regeneration. In a rat model of a femoral bone defect, we will employ
a factorial experimental design to determine effective rehabilitative loading protocols in critically sized injuries,
and determine the effects of rehabilitation on local and systemic biological responses and functional regeneration
as a function of sex and injury size. Specific Aim 2: Integrate sensor-enabled real-time feedback into
rehabilitation protocols and test the ability to accelerate bone and muscle functional recovery following
severe extremity injury. This aim will use wireless implantable strain sensors to provide noninvasive monitoring
of mechanics in the regenerative niche throughout the progression of healing under rehabilitative loading. Sensor
mechanical data will be used to identify strain ranges that serve as early indicators of healing status and are
used as a criterion for dynamically adjusting the rehabilitation regimen on a subject-specific basis to accelerate
functional regeneration of musculoskeletal tissue. Specific Aim 3: Build predictive multivariate models based
on co-dependent relationships among local regenerative niche mechanical parameters, systemic
biomarkers, and functional regeneration. Finite element modeling will be used to generate simulated strain
maps showing local variations in regenerative niche mechanical signals using implantable sensor measurements
as time-varying boundary conditions. Linear multivariate analyses will be used to map spatial and temporal
relationships between the biological responses and local regenerative niche mechanics under rehabilitative
loading regimens. Integrating early mechanical data and systemic biomarker data from the previous aims,
nonlinear symbolic regression will be used to develop predictive models of bone and muscle functional outcomes
for subjects of both sexes. These models will be tested in a prospective study using an additional cohort of both
sexes to validate whether models developed in one sex can be predictive of healing outcomes in both the same
and the opposite sexes."

provide an important approach for achieving this goal and for the preclinical exploration of novel treatments.
Here we focus on two types of mouse models relevant to drug-resistant seizure disorders in humans: the
pilocarpine status epilepticus model (PILO-SE) of acquired temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and a mouse model
with a genetic variant in voltage-gated ion channels that cause seizure disorders in humans.
 TLE shows a characteristic pattern of hippocampal neurodegeneration termed mesial temporal
sclerosis (MTS), with substantial loss of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 and CA3 regions and a relative sparing
of dentate gyrus (DG) and CA2 regions. Survival of DG and CA2 has led to the hypotheses that both are
important for seizure activity. Although the role of DG has been well studied in rodent models, the role of CA2
has remained relatively unexplored. In the previous funding period, we found that PILO-SE leads to increased
overall CA2 excitation, due to increased intrinsic excitability, enhanced synaptic excitation from DG and
reduced synaptic inhibition. Importantly, we found that chronic chemogenetic or acute closed-loop optogenetic
silencing of CA2 led to a significant decrease in seizure activity in PILO-SE mice.
 However, our previous analyses were restricted to dorsal CA2. We will address here the role of ventral
CA2, as studies in both humans and rodent models suggest that ventral hippocampus may be an even more
important site for seizures in TLE than dorsal hippocampus. We will therefore investigate the hypothesis that
chemogenetic and/or optogenetic silencing of ventral CA2 will be even more effective in reducing seizures than
observed upon silencing dorsal CA2. Our previous studies also left open the question as to whether the
increase in CA2 excitation in PILO-SE is causally related to the role of CA2 in seizures. We will address this
question by asking whether interventions that restore normal levels of CA2 intrinsic excitability can rescue
seizures in PILO-SE. Such experiments have the advantage over genetic-based silencing as they will not
interfere with the normal role of CA2 in hippocampal-dependent social memory.
 In addition to acquired forms of epilepsy, an increasing number of cases of epilepsy have been shown
to be caused by genetic variants, some associated with MTS and others without MTS. Here we address
whether CA2 may play a more general role in seizure activity by investigating its role in a mouse model of a
genetic form of epilepsy caused by mutations in the gene encoding the HCN1 voltage-gated ion channel, and
testing whether CA2 silencing can suppress seizures in this model.
 The experiments of this proposal thus offer the promise of further validating CA2 as target for novel
therapeutic approaches for treatment of a range of seizure disorders."

Pediatric feeding disorders are on the rise and are present in 20-50% of typically developing children (1-8) and
in 33-80% of children with developmental delay (9, 10). Furthermore, infants who are born preterm are
particularly at-risk for sucking and feeding difficulties (11, 12). Early non-nutritive suck (NNS) – or sucking
without nutrients being delivered – and feeding skills have been shown to be reliable indicators of central
nervous system (CNS) integrity (18). In fact, delays in sucking and feeding have been reported in
approximately 35-48% of infants with different types of neonatal brain injury (18). Sucking, feeding, speech,
and language all develop in parallel in the first year of life and rely heavily on sensorimotor integration.
However, the link between sucking and feeding skills, CNS function, and development extends beyond the
neonatal period. Emerging retrospective research links neonatal sucking and feeding patterns to subsequent
speech (13) and language (14-17) development in early childhood. Although these behaviors emerge on a
similar timeline and share neural resources and musculature, they are rarely studied together and the links
between them remain unknown. We propose a longitudinal study to sample NNS data at 3, 6, 9, and 12
months of age and speech outcomes at 12, 24, and 36 months of age across full-term (n=85) and moderate to
late preterm (32-37 weeks’ gestational age; n=85) infants. The specific goals of the proposed research are as
follows: (Aim 1) to establish typical patterns of NNS across infants born full-term and preterm in the first year of
life and utilize a functional data analysis to examine infants’ NNS burst waveforms, and (Aim 3) to determine
the ability of NNS to predict subsequent speech development across preterm and full-term infants until age
three. We hypothesize that infant suck will change significantly across the first year of life with infants born
premature performing worse on these measures compared to full-term infants. In addition, we hypothesize that
neonatal suck will predict speech development across preterm and full-term infants. This study provides an
unprecedented level of power in identifying the connection between neonatal sucking and subsequent speech
emergence for several reasons: we will use our (1) innovative, custom and quantitative NNS device to sample
suck across (2) two groups of infants and will (3) utilize functional data analyses to better understand NNS
development and its implications for speech development later in life. (4) We will use standardized and non-
standardized approaches to longitudinally study speech development, which will allow for a more robust and
nuanced understanding of how NNS and speech are connected in infants and children. Overall, this project
captures three years of in-depth oral motor coordination using state-of-the-art methods and collaborators to
answer important theoretical questions. Results generated by this clinically relevant and theoretically driven
study will create a paradigm shift in how clinicians approach feeding and speech therapies in early childhood."
10745951,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) ranks as the third leading cause of death in the U.S., lacking
effective pharmacological treatment. Recent progress suggested that defective lung repair/regeneration likely
contribute to emphysema development. During repair/regeneration process, tissue progenitor cells require
optimal amount of energy supplies to fulfill cell proliferation and differentiation demands, which has been well
documented in stem cells in other organs such as intestine stem cells, neuro-progenitors and hematopoietic
stem cells. However, the metabolic control of stemness in lung epithelial progenitor cells remains elusive.
FAM13A (family with sequence similarity 13, member A) has been consistently associated with susceptibility to
COPD in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Our published work has demonstrated that FAM13A is
mainly expressed in alveolar type II epithelial cells, regarded as lung stem cells. However, whether and how
Fam13a regulates alveolar repair/regeneration, especially through modulating metabolism in lung epithelial
progenitors remain incompletely understood. In last funding cycle, we have published that Fam13a promotes
the degradation of beta-catenin and inhibits cell growth. However, depletion of beta-catenin failed to completely
revert phenotype seen in Fam13-/- mice, suggesting additional pathways regulated by FAM13A may play a role
in the lung repair/regeneration process. Our unpublished data suggested that Fam13a not only responds to
Akt-mediated growth factor signaling but also represses the energy master regulator AMPK (c-AMP activated
kinase) in cell lines and primary murine lung epithelial cells, suggesting an undiscovered metabolic control by
Fam13a in lung epithelial progenitors. We, therefore, hypothesize that FAM13A may act as a key metabolic
switch for cell growth through coupling energy homeostasis with cell growth demands in alveolar epithelial cells
during lung regeneration. In this proposal, we are going to test this hypothesis through integrative approaches
including in vitro biochemical assays, in vivo lineage tracing, smoke-induced emphysema mouse models,
CRISPR-based genome editing and ex vivo organoid co-culture models. Successful completion of this project
will shed mechanistic insights into molecular mechanism by which FAM13A transduces growth factor signals to
metabolic controls on stemness of lung epithelial progenitors through interacting its upstream regulator Akt and
downstream effector AMPK thereby possibly offering novel anti-COPD therapeutics."
10745958,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We have recently identified a novel human neurogenetic disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the
mitochondrial enzyme glutamate pyruvate transaminase 2 (GPT2). Genetic metabolic diseases, such as GPT2
disease, offer a powerful lens to investigate mechanisms of metabolism in human brain. Also, metabolic
diseases may be amenable to treatments via dietary restrictions or supplements. GPT2 disease involves
postnatal undergrowth of brain and progressive spastic paraplegia. Based on our extensive preliminary data,
we have established potential treatment strategies for GPT2 disease. To guide these interventions in children,
we propose to complete needed pre-clinical studies. GPT2 localizes to mitochondria and is upregulated during
postnatal brain development. GPT2 catalyzes the reversible addition of an amino group from glutamate to
pyruvate, yielding alanine and a-ketoglutarate, a metabolite in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Our
preliminary data provide support for disease mechanisms, wherein GPT2 plays a critical role in neuronal
growth by regulating neuronal alanine synthesis and anaplerosis. Anaplerosis (filling-up) is the metabolic
process whereby TCA cycle intermediates are replenished. Anaplerosis is important during high biosynthetic
demand, when TCA cycle intermediates are consumed for synthesis of macromolecules for cell growth, a
process known as cataplerosis. Therefore, the central objective of this R01 application is to define the role of
GPT2-mediated mechanisms in neuronal development and health, and to study the efficacy of mechanism-
based treatments. Aim 1 is focused on in vivo studies of Gpt2-mediated growth of motor neurons. Our Gpt2-
null mouse recapitulates key aspects of disease, such as hindlimb motor abnormalities, akin to spastic
paraplegia seen in patients. In Aim1 and in Aim 2, we are developing mechanism-based rescue strategies to
treat motor defects in vivo through metabolite supplementation in the diets of Gpt2-null animals. Aim 3 will
define GPT2-mediated metabolic mechanisms governing neuronal growth and treatments in vitro. These
studies are in both primary mouse neurons, as well as in human neurons (from stem cells) in order to translate
advances back to the human context. We have a strong and multidisciplinary team permitting a powerful
integrated translational approach, bridging patient-oriented studies to experimental models. In summary,
research in this proposal will have a sustained impact on both fundamental neuroscience and treatment
development. We will evaluate therapeutic strategies that could be rapidly implemented in patients with GPT2
disease, which currently has no known treatment. This progress would pave the way for early intervention, and
potentially, prevention of neurologic damage in patients with GPT2 disease. Finally, these studies have broad
significance, as we will define basic metabolic mechanisms required for growth and health of long-projecting
neurons, including long-projecting motor neurons that are vulnerable in a variety of neurological diseases."

10746067,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Vascular occlusive disease remains a critical cardiovascular health issue and results in about 500,000
percutaneous-coronary angioplasties annually in the US. Restenosis due to neointimal hyperplasia occurs after
10-30% of angioplasties and remains a critical problem in cardiovascular medicine. No new approaches to
improve the standard treatment, the insertion of mTOR inhibitor-or taxol-eluting stents, have been developed in
a decade. Addressing this critical problem will require novel strategies to inhibit proliferation of vascular smooth
muscle cells (VSMCs), the main driver of neointimal hyperplasia.
 Our long-term goal is to determine how mitochondrial function modulates cytosolic signaling events in
VSMCs and endothelial cells in vascular disease. The overall objective of the proposed research is to
determine how the highly conserved GTPase MIRO1, which resides in the outer mitochondrial membrane,
regulates VSMC proliferation and neointima formation and test new mechanistic therapies. MIRO1 is known to
control intracellular trafficking of mitochondria. Nascent data suggest that MIRO1 may have additional
functions beyond mitochondrial trafficking. MIRO1 associates with the mitochondria-ER contact sites (MERCS)
that facilitate mitochondrial Ca2+ entry and maintains the organization of mitochondrial cristae that is pivotal for
electron transport chain (ETC) activity. Yet, the functional consequences of MIRO1 binding are not fully
understood, and the implications for human disease, in particular in vascular disease, have remained
unknown. We previously reported that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and energy production are required for cell-
cycle progression in VSMCs in G1/S transition and beyond. Our pilot studies reveal that proliferation in VSMCs
with MIRO1 deletion is abolished starting at G1/S transition. Thus, we speculate that MIRO1 controls VSMC
proliferation via two hitherto unrecognized processes. Thus, our central hypothesis is that MIRO1 is required
for VSMC proliferation, and thus for neointimal hyperplasia, by controlling the mitochondrial-ER Ca2+
transit and ETC activity. This is supported by our strong pilot data demonstrating that MIRO1 deletion
blocks neointimal hyperplasia, VSMC proliferation and ATP production. Our novel tools and assays put us in a
perfect position to test our hypothesis, including VSMC lines that lack MIRO1 or express MIRO1 mutants, and
innovative RNA-aptamer-based tools for targeting of VSMCs in vivo after vascular injury.
 Our specific aims are 1. to determine the extent to which MIRO1 regulation of Ca2+ transport at
MERCS controls cell-cycle progression, 2. to establish the extent to which the control of cristae
organization by MIRO1 regulates ETC activity and proliferation, and 3. to test whether VSMC-specific
aptamers that deliver siMIRO1 effectively reduce neointima hyperplasia. The anticipated outcomes of
the proposed study are knowledge of the mechanisms by which MIRO1 promotes VSMC proliferation, and of
the potential of RNA-based aptamers with siMIRO1 activity in preventing restenosis after vascular injury."

 Incisional hernia (IH) is a common, overlooked surgical health problem spanning a broad range of patients
and stakeholders. In the U.S., over 153,000 IHs are repaired per year with expenditures exceeding $7 billion.
Evidence-based interventions, including preoperative optimization, surgical techniques, and prophylactic mesh,
can reduce risk; however, multi-level factors impede clinical translation. One critical barrier is the need for
accurate, generalizable risk prediction to link risk recognition, behavior change, and outcomes. Pre-operative
risk assessment enables providers to leverage risk information to guide decision-making, surgical planning,
and informed consent. Current limitations of IH prediction have created barriers to IH prevention. Our proposal
addresses the need for patient-specific, clearly presented risk information to enhance health care, enable
individualized risk assessment, and close the gap between optimal practice and actual clinical care in hernia
prevention. Our preliminary research has defined the clinical and economic burden of IH, characterized
inefficiencies in treatment-oriented paradigms, defined key patient populations for prevention, and
demonstrated effective risk reductive surgical techniques. We also show the benefit of using electronic health
record-based prediction over administrative claims datasets and the power of machine learning to maximize
model performance. Most recently, we created a pilot, portable, clinical decision support-mobile user interface
for prediction, setting the stage for this proposal. Our approach is hallmarked by use of a unique multi-source
database, innovative applications of machine learning, stake-holder engagement, and inter-disciplinary
collaboration. In this proposal, we will identify and discover factors associated with IH using data from
>130,000 patients with longitudinal follow-up and characterize intra-operative risk factors using natural
language processing. Machine learning will enable improved predictive performance (Aim 1). Models will be
tested on a geo-temporally diverse data source and end-user input will guide and prioritize features, format,
and functionality, leading to creation of a provider-adapted Hernia Calc housing the predictive models (Aim 2).
Hernia Calc will be evaluated in real-world practice to assess contextual determinants and to create a
stakeholder-driven implementation protocol to identify strategies to support widespread dissemination (Aim 3).
Our approach addresses barriers to IH prevention through development of optimized, validated, specialty-
specific IH risk models integrated within a provider-informed interface and implementation strategies for clinical
use. This work will lead to a broad, significant, and sustained impact on the field, catalyzing a major pivot
towards hernia prevention, enabling precise risk prediction for abdominal surgery patients. Completion of our
aims will augment knowledge of hernia and improve health outcomes in surgery allowing a pivot in practice
towards prevention and aligning our proposal with Core Missions of the NIH."
10746103,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
UTX/KDM6A is an important tumor suppressor and developmental regulator, and is frequently
mutated in human cancers and certain neurodevelopmental disorders including Kabuki
syndrome. Though UTX is a histone H3K27 demethylase, the demethylase activity is often
dispensable in mediating tumor suppression and developmental regulation, and the key molecular
activity of UTX in these processes remains elusive. UTX is thought to regulate chromatin activity
by associating with and coordinating the function of MLL3/KMT2C and MLL4/KMT2D, the major
H3K4 mono-methylase at enhancers, and the p300 histone acetyltransferase, all of which are
also frequently mutated in human cancers. In our preliminary studies, we found that the tumor
suppressive activity of UTX requires its phase separation property conferred by its core
Intrinsically Disordered Region (cIDR). Endogenous UTX forms dynamic condensates in mouse
embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and its cIDR is important for ESC differentiation. UTX and MLL4
form co-condensates that enhance the H3K4 mono-methylation activity. We also found that UTY,
the Y chromosome homolog of UTX, has weaker tumor suppressive activity that is associated
with formation of less dynamic condensates. These results let us formulate our central hypothesis
that UTX needs to be in condensates with appropriate biophysical properties to be active in
regulating gene expression on chromatin in regulating tumorigenesis and stem cell differentiation.
We proposal two Specific Aims.
Aim 1. Determine the mechanisms by which UTX condensation regulates chromatin
activity. We will determine how UTX condensation regulates chromatin modification activities by
biochemical reconstitution, and also through integrative analyses of multiple levels of chromatin
activity in both transduced cancer cells and endogenous Utx-edited ESCs.
Aim 2. Determine how biophysical properties of the UTX condensates regulate its
biological activities. We will study biophysical properties of UTX WT and variant condensates
and its associated co-activators. We will determine impacts of condensate properties on biological
activities at different levels in in both transduced cancer cells and endogenous Utx-edited ESCs.
We will also examine effect of disease-associated missense mutations of UTX on condensate
properties."
10750991,"Influenza infection is a recurring public health burden and our current strategies of seasonal influenza
vaccination provide suboptimal protection. Thus, it is critical to provide basic, mechanistic insights into the
possibility of universal influenza vaccines and much work is devoted to strategies to induce broadly
neutralizing antibodies. However, in the absence of neutralizing antibodies, the presence of IAV-specific
memory CD8 T cells targeting conserved viral proteins such as NP or M2, which are maintained
systemically as well as in the lung correlate with control of viral titers and reduction of disease symptoms in
humans. Mouse models suggest it is the lung resident memory CD8 T cells (Trm) that enable swift and
robust protection against IAV infection. Thus, establishing a robust long-term Trm population in the lung may
be an important goal for an IAV vaccine with broad coverage. Recent evidence from our laboratories shows
that repetitive encounter with influenza infection to generate quaternary (4M) memory in the lung profoundly
improves the durability of lung Trm and heterosubtypic immunity compared to primary (1M) memory Trm.
Our long-term goal is to understand the biology of IAV-induced Trm and how these cells can be
manipulated to enhance immunity to aid in development of universal influenza vaccines. We will address
this long-term goal with the following specific aims:
Specific Aim 1. Determine the mechanisms underlying improved durability of 4M vs 1M IAV-specific lung
Trm

10750995,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Venoarterial Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (VA-ECMO) is a life-saving intervention for patients with
refractory cardiac failure, and the frequency of its use continues to increase in the United States. However, during
ECMO, exposure of blood to the non-biological material in the ECMO circuit and to trauma from the pump or
oxygenator initiates the coagulation cascade. Consequently, patients become vulnerable to stroke and require
systemic anticoagulation. VA-ECMO carries a risk of arterial circuit thrombosis as well as microemboli from
platelet aggregates or damaged blood cells, which is hypothesized to cause acute ischemic stroke in patients
on ECMO support. In addition, as VA-ECMO immediately restores perfusion to brain, routine administration of
high-percentage oxygen for the first hours after ECMO cannulation is hypothesized to cause acute brain injury
and worsening of injured brain with reperfusion injury. This neurologic injury early after ECMO cannulation
provides an opportunity for intervention strategy when the relation between acute brain injury and these
modifiable risk factors, ECMO circuit clots, and hyperoxia, is established.
For many years, I have had a strong interest in the effects of arterial-sided thrombosis and hyperoxia on acute
brain injury and neurologic outcome. Additionally, I have extensive research experience in brain injury and
neurologic outcome in adult patients with mechanical circulatory support devices. I am the director of adult ECMO
research at Johns Hopkins Hospital and am involved with studies that have helped to define the association
between left ventricular assist devices and neurologic injury. My interest in mechanical circulatory support
devices has led me to address key knowledge and practice gaps in VA-ECMO, the concomitant acute brain
injury, and its impact on neurologic outcome. The proposed research addresses two important “modifiable”
factors—blood clots and hyperoxia—in adult VA-ECMO patients and their relation to neurologic outcome. I
propose to investigate whether arterial-sided ECMO-generated clots are associated with acute ischemic stroke
(Aim 1) and the effects of hyperoxia within 24 hours of ECMO cannulation on neurologic outcome at hospital
discharge (Aim 2). Should ECMO-generated clots and hyperoxia prove to carry a substantial risk for acute brain
injury and unfavorable neurologic outcome, I will propose clinical trials to target these modifiable factors by
strategies such as using conservative oxygen therapy after ECMO cannulation and changing anticoagulation
approaches to reduce cerebral emboli. This grant will equip me with the content, methodological expertise, and
multidisciplinary collaboration required to be successful as an independent NIH-funded, patient-oriented
clinician-scientist in collaboration with cardiac surgery, critical care, and neurology. This award will also provide
critically novel discoveries that may likely impact care related to arterial-sided ECMO-generated clots and
hyperoxia in these vulnerable adult patients with critical illness."
10750998,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Methylmercury (MeHg) is a potent neurotoxin affecting both the developing and mature central nervous system
with apparent indiscriminate disruption of multiple homeostatic pathways. However, genetic and environmental
modifiers contribute significant variability to neurotoxicity associated with human exposures. Furthermore,
neurotoxic outcomes show evidence of persistence and latent effects long after exposure has subsided. MeHg
neurotoxicity is associated with oxidative stress and impaired redox homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction,
activation of cell stress pathways, alteration of proteostasis, calcium dysregulation, damage to neuronal
processes and neuronal/synaptic dysfunction, to name a few. Though, these same pathological hallmarks are
seen with exposure to many (perhaps even most) neurotoxicants and underlie degenerative and developmental
disorders. Hence, while they serve as key outcomes of MeHg exposure and indicators of neurological damage,
their connection to underlying targets of MeHg neurotoxicity and inter-relationships between each other are
unknown. Compelling evidence identifies both dopaminergic (DAergic) and glutamatergic (GLUergic) neurons
as targets of MeHg-induced persistent neurotoxicity. Here we seek to identify and understand persistent and
latent effects of MeHg toxicity on biological pathways impacted by MeHg toxicity. Our goal is to understand the
toxicological hierarchy and temporal susceptibility of key toxic outcome pathways and their perpetuation. This
proposal leverages innovative technologies and the unique resources of its investigative team to build a highly
translatable and mechanistic approach. The genetically tractable Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) model
system is ideally suited for discovering genetic and molecular mechanisms associated with neurotoxicity. The
human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) model enables assessment of human genetic/pharmacological
modifiers influencing neurotoxic outcomes and susceptibility along the ontogeny of defined neural lineages. Our
overarching hypothesis is that persistent effects of MeHg are self-perpetuating via interdependent relationships
of key biological pathways that sustain and regulate neurological function. We propose three aims, with each
utilizing C. elegans and hiPSC neuronal models of DAergic and GLUergic neurons, to yield a highly
complementary and robust scientific approach. To address the overarching hypothesis we have designed three
highly meritorious Specific Aims, namely (1) to evaluate the temporal pattern of persistent and latent MeHg
neurotoxicity following early and/or late developmental exposures by unbiased gene expression analysis, (2) to
test the hypothesis that the latency periods and severity of persistent neurotoxic effects of MeHg are dependent
on exposure timing, duration and total levels, and (3) to test the hypothesis that the latent/persistent effects of
MeHg exposure on biological pathways are interrelated and inexorable."
10751006,"The overarching goal of this program is to define cellular and molecular events during neural development vulnerable to genetic perturbations that increase risk for neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders. Currently, our knowledge of human brain development is largely inferred from animal models, indirect measures of human development, and limited access to human neural tissue. All of these are valid tools to piece together the sequential processes of human neural development but are not sufficient to describe the dynamics with enough temporal or molecular resolution to understand mechanistically how genetic risk factors can affect brain formation and function. Technological advances in cellular reprogramming have now made it possible to derive induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from adult patients, which are a renewable resource for the generation of human neurons with disease-relevant genetic features. This long-term research program is designed to incorporate human iPSC-based studies with animal models to provide a comprehensive and longitudinal understanding of neural development, from neural stem cell behavior to neuronal development, synapse formation and circuit integration. As a proof-of-principle, these studies will use a prominent copy number variation (CNV) risk factor for multiple neurological disorders, 15q11.2CNVs, to illustrate how multifaceted interrogations of the basic biology of neural development in the context of genetic variation can reveal new targets for testing mechanism-based intervention in relevant subtypes of human neurons, as well as animal models of neural function and behavior. Building on significant scientific discoveries we have made in the fields of stem cell biology, adult neurogenesis, and patient-specific iPSCs, and technological innovations we have developed to meet critical challenges in each of these fields, our primary research focus is to integrate multiple levels of analysis to provide a high-resolution description of the cellular processes and molecular mechanisms of neural development that can be used to probe genetic or environmental risk for neurological disorders. Three interlinked projects will be pursued. Project 1 will focus on adult mouse neurogenesis as a model for neural development and use clonal analysis of neural stem cells and their development, single-cell transcriptome analysis, and transgenic mouse models to dissect molecular, cellular, and circuit level effects of genetic mutations on neural development; Project 2 will use human iPSCs with known genetic risk factors, and targeted differentiation protocols, to interrogate human neural development in 2D and 3D cultures; and Project 3 will focus on identifying the molecular mechanisms and targets of risk genes in both animal models and human iPSC-derived neurons and the rescue of observed deficits through rational therapeutic intervention. This is an opportune moment to synthesize recently developed technologies and build a novel translational platform to study underlying mechanisms of neurological disorders, and facilitate the identification of strategies to diagnose, treat, and prevent the often debilitating consequences of dysregulated neural development."
10751007,"For the brain to detect relevant signals about the outside world, neurons must be able to collect, manipulate
and transmit information. Detecting motion is a fundamental task of the visual system, and specialized direction
selective (DS) cells are present already at the retina. Due to its experimental accessibility, the DS circuit in the
mammalian retina emerged as a classical model system of a sophisticated information processing in the brain.
Retinal DS ganglion cells are maximally activated by motion in their preferred direction, and their output guides
reflexive behavior and possibly conscious perception.
It is now well established that directional tuning of the ganglion cells reflects DS input from starburst amacrine
cells (SAC), where the first fundamental step of motion detection takes place. SAC dendrites transform a non-DS input from bipolar cells into DS output that is manifested as a stronger output for motion in the outward
direction. A rich literature indicates that DS in individual SACs depends on an intricate combination of factors,
including dendritic morphology, dynamics of the synaptic inputs and the distribution of voltage-gated channels.
While a number of different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the transformation of visual
information from unselective inputs into direction selective output, the relative contribution of these processes
to the function of the cell remains controversial. In addition, detailed numerical simulations that incorporate the
leading models of DS in SACs underestimate the experimentally recorded motion discrimination abilities in
these cells, indicating the presence of additional unidentified DS mechanism(s).
The goal of this proposal is to address the mechanisms that mediate DS in individual SACs. We will take an
innovative approach that combines biophysically realistic modeling, electrophysiology, as well as glutamate
and calcium imaging to provide a detailed description of the of the visual information representation in the DS
circuit, with a particular focus on SAC dendrites. The proposed experimental and theoretical treatment will
study how visual signals are transformed to synaptic inputs that innervate SACs and test a novel mechanism
that depends on postsynaptic voltage-gated channels to sharpen DS signals in SAC dendrites.
The proposed research will substantially advance our understanding of DS mechanisms in the visual system. It
will also provide a conceptually novel role for the participation of active channels in dendritic computations."
10751010,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Although smoothly linking individual actions into sequences is critical for execution of complex behaviors, we
still have a limited understanding of how behavioral sequences are encoded in the brain. Accumulating
evidence suggests that striatal activity patterns are linked to performance of sequenced behaviors, but the
role of cortical inputs in their initiation and control is less clear. We therefore used the SAPAP3-knockout
(KO) mouse experimental system, which displays repetitive grooming behavior associated with central
striatal (CS) hyperactivity, to investigate how cortical and striatal regions interact to generate both normal
and perseverative action patterns. In our recent work, we demonstrated that SAPAP3-KOs do not have
abnormalities in striatal intrinsic properties using ex vivo electrophysiology. However, we observed large (~6
fold) increases in extrinsic drive to CS from the major cortical input to this region: anterolateral motor area
(ALM- also known as M2). (Corbit et al, 2019). These results suggested that repeated selection of motor
programs could be caused by excessive drive from ALM, an area whose human homologues (SMA/pre-
SMA) have been linked to Tourette Syndrome (TS) and OCD. Our preliminary optogenetics and
photometry data support this theory by identifying ALM activity that ramps up during grooming, and
terminates at grooming bout cessation. Together, these results indicate that ALM may be a key under-
recognized hub for the regulation of innate sequenced behaviors. However, 1) this idea has not yet
been rigorously tested, and 2) it is unclear if the same principles apply to learned sequenced behaviors.
Here we will use state-dependent optogenetics, ex vivo electrophysiology, and longitudinal in vivo Ca+2
imaging to determine the role of ALM in the generation of normal and abnormal innate and learned
sequenced behaviors. In Aim 1, we will Identify the ALM ensemble responsible for grooming-associated

of innate and/or learned sequenced behaviors. In Aim 3, we will define the role of ALM activity during
performance of learned sequences using in vivo microscopy and optogenetics. The goal of these studies is
to determine how cortico-striatal circuits control the assembly of individual actions into organized sequences,
which could ultimately lead to new neurostimulation-based treatment targets for perseverative behaviors."

The choice of developing T cells to adopt the CD4 helper or CD8 killer cell fate is a valuable model for
understanding mammalian cell fate decisions and is a key step in shaping the adaptive immune response.
While it is known that TCR recognition of self pMHC ligands in the thymus controls cell fate, the molecular
links between TCR signaling and the activation of the lineage-defining transcriptional networks remains
unknown. Guided by a high-resolution single cell map of T cell development, we propose to define the
molecular links between different branches of the TCR signaling pathway and the transcriptional network
that specifies the CD4 fate (Aim 1). We will also probe the factors that determine why thymocytes that
recognize MHC-2 fully activate this network, whereas thymocytes that recognize MHC-1 do not (Aim 2). The
proposed studies will reveal fundamental principles underlying mammalian cell fate decisions and help to
understand the molecular mechanisms that link the killer versus helper T cell effector functional programs to
the recognition of MHC 1 versus 2."

Bacterial chromosomes are highly structured in order to accommodate their large size in a relatively small
cellular package. In E. coli, the chromosome is divided into 31 chromosomal interaction domains (CIDs) and
several larger and topologically isolated macrodomains. The structures defining macrodomain boundaries are
unknown. One macrodomain of about 1 million bp encompasses the replication terminus and is referred to as
the Ter macrodomain. We have discovered two 222 bp and intergenic repeat sequences in the E. coli genome,
symmetrically arranged around the replication terminus and just outside what has been defined as the Ter
macrodomain. These sequences, now called replication risk sequences or RRS, trigger unusual levels of RecA
deposition in local single-stranded gaps. The RRS affect replication and are highly conserved in enterobacteria,
including many pathogens. Deletion of one RRS generates a growth defect. It has not been possible to delete
both RRS, suggesting that the retention of at least one of them is essential. The RRS represent a new genomic
phenomenon and likely represent a chromosomal structural feature involved in genomic replication,
condensation, segregation, or all three. We hypothesize that the function of RRS is to relieve topological stress.
The RRS may represent the physical reality of the Ter macrodomain boundaries. Given a complete lack of
information about RRS, we are proposing a general characterization to understand their effects on replication
and transcription. The methods include a variety of standard genetics, microscopy, cell biology, molecular
biology, and genomics. Nonstandard methods include a newly devised genomics method that allows the
probing of genomic single-stranded DNA called ssGAP-seq and single molecule replication assays carried out
in vitro. The goal is basic understanding of the role of RRS in bacterial nucleic acid metabolism to inform future
work."
10749037,"Project Summary/Abstract
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by inflexible patterns of experiential, behavioral, and
physiological emotional responding. Following trauma exposure, the indiscriminate avoidance of trauma-
related cues contributes to the maintenance of PTSD, which tends to be chronic and associated with a myriad
of deleterious personal and public health consequences. Although inflexible emotional responding has been
identified as a critical maintenance factor for PTSD, less is understood about how trauma-exposed people fall
into these problematic emotion regulation patterns. Recent theory posits that the ability to differentiate between
discrete negative emotions allows individuals to extract emotion-related information to guide the effective use
of emotion regulation strategies in service of personal goals. When negative emotions are experienced with
less granularity, emotion information becomes less readily available and places people at risk for maladaptive
emotion regulation. Negative emotion differentiation (NED) has yet to be examined in the context of avoidance
in PTSD, however, or in relation to markers of physiological inflexibility that are believed to contribute to
emotion regulation problems across a range of clinical disorders, including PTSD. Thus, there is a need for an
integrated investigation spanning multiple units of analysis to understand how NED confers risk for emotion
regulation problems known to maintain PTSD. The objective of the proposed research is to elucidate whether
NED is impaired in PTSD and associated with avoidance and resting respiratory sinus arrythmia (RSA) – a
marker of physiological flexibility – in the lab and in daily life. Aims of the proposal include determining whether
NED is impaired among those with PTSD relative to those without PTSD (Aim 1), whether NED is associated
with self-reported trait avoidance and daily trauma-related avoidance (Aim 2), and whether NED is associated
with resting RSA in the lab and in daily life (Aim 3). Given that NED is believed to guide emotion regulation
strategy use based on the demands imposed by the environment, this project will also examine whether NED
moderates the links between avoidance and PTSD (Aim 4). These aims will be tested using data from an
ongoing NIH-funded study (1R15MH114142) of 80 trauma-exposed community members with and without
PTSD. PTSD diagnosis and severity, trait-level avoidance, and resting RSA are assessed in the lab and three
days of ecological momentary assessment and ambulatory physiological assessment are used to monitor daily
trauma-related avoidance, resting RSA, and PTSD symptoms. The proposed project will advance the field by
delineating associations between NED and emotion regulation problems across multiple units of analysis in
PTSD. Elucidating the interplay between NED and emotion regulation problems may also provide insight into
the etiology and maintenance of PTSD. As an NRSA F31 proposal, this project includes a training plan
consisting of formal coursework, workshops, experiential learning, and mentorship in PTSD, emotion dynamics
and regulation, autonomic psychophysiology, ambulatory assessment, and multilevel modeling."
11088260,"Protein misfolding diseases, or proteinopathies, are a group of invariably fatal neurodegenerative disorders
affecting more than 6.8 million Americans. In multiple system atrophy (MSA) and other synucleinopathy
patients, the protein α-synuclein (α-syn) misfolds into a self-templating conformation that spreads via a prion-
like manner throughout the body, including the central nervous system (CNS). It is hypothesized that the
conformation, or strain, that α-syn misfolds into encodes information about the clinical symptoms and
neuropathologies a patient will develop. While previous studies focused on the biochemical differences
between α-syn strains, the mechanism of how those differences encode distinct biological phenotypes of
disease is poorly understood. The long-term goal of our research is to identify the agent and host factors that
contribute to the varied clinical presentations observed across synucleinopathies. In this proposal, we will test
the hypothesis that strain-specific differences in aggregate transport and neuroanatomical spread contribute to
disease pathogenesis. In Aim 1, we will use alexa fluor-labeled α-syn aggregates to investigate the rate and
direction of axonal transport in vitro and in vivo. To determine the molecular mechanisms responsible for α-syn
transport, we will use chemical and genetic tools to disrupt microtubule polymerization, dynein motor activity,
and dynein cargo adaptor binding, and quantify the strain-specific effects on α-syn axonal transport. In Aim 2,
we will determine the role of trans-synaptic spread on α-syn strain pathogenesis. To rigorously perform these
studies, we will first determine the titer of three different α-syn strains both in vitro and in vivo. We will then use
the sciatic nerve injection model, with and without nerve transection, to determine if α-syn neuroinvasion relies
exclusively on trans-synaptic spread, of if extraneural pathways contribute to disease pathogenesis when the
same titer of each strain is injected. Finally, we will perform a thorough disease pathogenesis study to establish
a temporal-spatial map of strain-specific α-syn spread. This work is innovative because it is the first study to
investigate how interactions between the host and strain impact disease progression, and to establish between
in vitro and in vivo α-syn titers. This work is significant because it is the first to investigate how interactions
between host and strain contribute to the mechanisms underlying axonal transport and trans-synaptic spread
of disease. Critically, by identifying the cellular and molecular machinery responsible for α-syn propagation, the
results of these experiments will lead to new areas of promising investigation."

The importance of physician-scientists in maintaining a close connection between basic research and the issues
encountered in clinical practice has been widely recognized. Nevertheless, the number of physician-scientists
continues to decrease, particularly in surgical subspecialties. A combination of effective mentorship and a strong
foundation in research methodology and data analysis is crucial for building a successful career as a clinician-
scientist. Unfortunately, for trainees and early career faculty in otolaryngology and the communication sciences
the availability of such support varies widely between programs, often due to inherent disparities in departmental
or institutional resources. We are seeking supplemental support for the Research Symposium for Clinician-
Scientist Development in Otolaryngology and the Communication Sciences. This yearly national
conference will assemble promising otolaryngology residents, fellows, and early career faculty for a host of
lectures, workshops, and panels that focus on keys to research success. Support is requested for 1) organization
of a ‘Research Boot Camp’ that provides instruction in research methodology, study design, grantsmanship,
manuscript review, and other aspects of a successful research enterprise, 2) resources for competitively
awarded travel grants to promising early career otolaryngologists, and 3) support for successful otolaryngology
surgeon-scientists to lead workshops and panels on career development and maintaining as successful research
program. This intensive experience will both motivate participants and provide them with the tools needed to
achieve success in translational research. This comparatively small financial investment will pay future dividends
by maintaining and diversifying the biomedical workforce in Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery and the
Communication Sciences."
10754934,"Progress in studies of enzyme mechanisms has slowed in recent years, in part because investigators have failed
to clearly define all of the important questions that must be addressed in order to move towards final conclusions
about these reaction mechanisms. Many of the studies described in this grant are designed to leverage the
potential for creative work directed towards answering the following question: ""How do enzymes achieve their
specificity in transition state (TS) binding?"" This potential has been harnessed in studies in Buffalo on the
mechanism of action of triosephosphate isomerase (TIM), orotidine 5'-monophosphate decarboxylase (OMPDC)
and glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH). These enzymes undergo dianion-driven conformational
changes from loose, unliganded, open enzymes to stiff, structured, catalytically active closed forms, which act
as “switches” that turn on the expression of tight transition state binding interactions. Four key question are
addressed in this grant, with the goals of generalizing earlier conclusions from TIM, OMPDC, and GPDH to other
enzymes, and of initiating new studies to develop novel inhibitors of TIM and OMPDC from pathogenic
organisms. Key Question 1: What other protein catalysts utilize binding interactions of their nonreacting substrate
fragments to drive enzyme-activating conformational changes? These experiments will probe whether the
binding energy from the adenosine ring of the substrate for adenylate kinase, or from the NAD cofactor of the
substrate for alcohol dehydrogenase, which drive conformational changes during catalysis by these enzymes,
act as a switch to turn on tight transition state binding interactions. Key Question 2: What interactions between
the catalytic and activation sites of TIM, OMPDC and GPDH enable utilization of the intrinsic substrate binding
energy for catalysis? Experiments are described to characterize a network of amino acid side chains involved in
catalysis by GPDH, and to characterize the mechanism for activation of OMPDC by the utilization of binding
interactions between the enzyme and the ribosyl hydroxyl groups of the substrates orotidine 5'-monophosphate
(OMP) and 5-F-OMP. Key Question 3: Are computational methods sufficiently advanced to model the effect of
site-directed mutations on the activation barrier for reactions catalyzed by TIM and GPDH? Calculations will be
carried out in collaboration with Professor Lynn Kamerlin in Uppsala, Sweden, to determine whether existing
EVB methods are able to model the results of extensive mutagenesis studies on these enzymes, with the goal
of expanding the limits of these computational methods. Key Question 4: What is the potential for selection of
peptides that show species specificity for inhibition of TIM and OMPDC from pathogenic organisms?
Experiments are proposed, in collaboration with Professor Hiroaki Suga at the University of Tokyo, Japan, to
identify species-specific inhibitors for TIM from Trypanosoma brucei and OMPDC from Plasmodium falciparum,
and to characterize the important inhibitor-protein interactions by X-ray crystallography and computational
docking studies."

This application requests support for the 50th annual meeting of the ORS Musculoskeletal Biology Workshop,
which had been held at Sun Valley, Idaho, for the past 20+ years. In 2022 the Workshop moved to the Utah
Rockies, just outside Salt Lake City. The 2023 workshop will be held in Midland, Utah at the Zermatt Resort,
from July 21-25, 2023. The Workshop was moved to the new location in response to feedback from attendees
over the past several years, who expressed a desire to have the meeting at a venue that was less expensive
and easier to get to. We have achieved both of those improvements with the new location. The conference
itself will maintain the same spirit it has enjoyed for several decades: it emphasizes active participation of junior
faculty and students; promotes interdisciplinary communication; and is unusual in that discussion time equals
or exceeds time allotted for formal presentation. The goals of the Workshop are to (1) work toward a
multidisciplinary basic and clinical synthesis of molecular, tissue and biomechanical processes in
musculoskeletal tissues that help us to understand the pathogenesis of bone, muscle, and cartilage disease as
well as its prevention and treatment; (2) apply basic science concepts to clinical problems; develop a dialogue
between basic and clinical investigators that leads to interdisciplinary collaboration; (3) identify significant
problems in musculoskeletal disease, and identify experimental approaches that provide solutions to them and
(4) provide a forum for student training and the opportunity in a small group setting for junior scientists to talk
with more senior scientists. A partnership between the Workshop and the Orthopaedic Research Society
(ORS) provides maximum visibility through broadcast emails and links on the ORS website. This year we
continue our newly instituted focus on problem solving, with the theme for the Workshop being
“Musculoskeletal cells: identity, targeting, stimulation, and manipulation for therapeutic gain.” Six sessions
address relevant and significant current problems, including current challenges with rare skeletal disease,
recent breakthroughs in our understanding of the biology of osteoarthritis, progress in bone-targeting molecular
tools for delivery of therapeutics, new insights into osteoclast origin and fate, advances in skeletal stem cells,
and the intersection of mechanobiology and imaging. A notable feature of this Workshop is that it is becoming
a truly musculoskeletal workshop, considering problems of musculoskeletal conditions beyond bone, though
the major focus remains bone. Opportunities are provided for junior investigators to interact with more senior
investigators. Two Career Development sessions specifically geared toward young investigators will be
conducted. Ten ASBMR/Frost Young Investigator Awardees will present their work from the podium. Ten or
more Jee Young Investigator Awards will also be distributed to increase young investigator attendance and
participation."
10893500,"Abstract
Dysphagia is a major consequence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) that is understudied and thus undertreated
despite high prevalence and high cost to heath care systems. Pathology in AD (inflammation, amyloidosis,
phosphorylated tau) occurs in the central and peripheral nervous systems early in disease progression and in
brain regions and muscle systems associated with swallowing functions. Barriers to effectively treating
dysphagia in AD are the lack of: (a) an understanding of central and peripheral pathology associated with
dysphagia, and (b) controlled studies of interventions at crucial timepoints, including early versus later in the
disease process. The proposed research is significant in addressing these barriers and rigorous in that we
will apply established translational research approaches currently used in our labs in models of aging and
Parkinson disease. Our scientific premise is that pathology in AD occurs in the central and peripheral nervous
systems early in disease progression and that exercise interventions can mitigate deficits induced by the
presence of pathology and potentially change the course of sensorimotor decline in function. Because tongue
muscles are primary actors in the swallowing process, our central hypotheses are that pathology manifests in
tongue muscle and brainstem, subcortical, and cortical regions associated with oropharyngeal swallowing and
that early implementation of tongue exercise leads to better swallowing outcomes. We will gain insight into
mechanisms by using the well-established TgF344-AD rat model and conducting physiological, morphological,
bioenergetic, neuroimaging, and behavioral assays in the brain and tongue muscles. Feasibility data show the
oromotor and swallowing dysfunction, evidence of inflammation in the brainstem, and increased beta-amyloid
in brain regions associated with swallowing in 12-month-old TgF344-AD rats. The tongue exercise intervention
is modeled after those used in clinical practice. However, these clinical protocols are not optimized due to
barriers in human research, such as presence of co-morbidities, adherence confounds, and limited access to
tissues. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that TgF344-AD rats demonstrate deficits in oromotor and swallowing
behaviors and manifest pathology in tongue muscles and brain structures critical to swallowing function. Aim 2
will test the hypothesis that early implementation of tongue exercise improves oromotor and swallow function
and modulates pathology in TgF344-AD rats. This research is innovative and will provide a new
understanding of mechanisms that underlie swallowing deficits in AD, query relationships among relatively
unexplored AD pathology and physiological function in swallow-related systems, and establish the
effectiveness of early versus late tongue exercise intervention for AD. Rehabilitation is often not provided to
patients with AD due to uncertain benefit. To advance evidence-based treatment, we must provide preclinical
data. This foundational work has a high impact because of the large and increasing population of people
with AD-associated dysphagia who can benefit from treatments optimized in the proposed studies."

xenografts in combination with sorafenib, an FDA-approved drug for unresectable HCC. PDZ1i also shows

This application is for a research training grant focused on training the next generation of academic cardiac and
thoracic surgeons. Given the current and future shortage of cardiothoracic surgeons, the extremely diverse
clinical activities, and broad array of conditions treated by cardiac and thoracic surgeons, an NIH T32 training
program in cardiothoracic surgery is an emergent unmet need to improve the cardiothoracic surgical workforce.
The necessary resources to support this mission is largely dictated by the capacity for initial research training
mid-way through the residency-fellowship training continuum. The proposed program leverages the experience
and framework of our successful ACGME accredited six year Integrated Thoracic Training Program, the research
and mentoring expertise of our Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery faculty, and the infrastructure of the
University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine (UPSOM) and UPMC Health System, to create a new T32 program
in cardiothoracic surgery. The proposed T32 program will provide a strong foundation of training in research,
serving leadership, and collaborative partnerships during residency training, which will help to establish and
promote successful independent career paths in academic cardiothoracic surgery. The proposed T32 program
will increase the pool of investigators who will be competitive for independent K- and R- awards as faculty. This
program will achieve the following specific goals: 1) Provide a stable and supportive infrastructure of research
training for academic cardiothoracic surgeons; 2) Recruit and select promising scholars and monitor their initial,
ongoing, and long-term successes; 3) Coordinate faculty mentoring and training of cardiothoracic surgeons to
provide a curated and individualized didactic curriculum and hands-on training that specifically addresses the
unique concerns of cardiothoracic surgery; 4) Leverage internal UPSOM, UPMC, and other institutional
resources in trainee-specific training plans; 5) Promote an inclusive culture at all levels through diversity training
and community outreach to recruit under-represented minority candidates to cardiothoracic surgery; 6) Provide
structured training in leadership, partnership and research program establishment during and beyond the period
of support to position trainees for launching successful independent academic careers. In the long-term, the
proposed T32 program will increase the number of academic cardiothoracic surgeons and will help to promote
a diverse workforce capable of accomplishing the NHLBI’s mission."

We have studied non-enveloped dsRNA viruses with single-layered (CPV), double-layered [mammalian reovirus (MRV) and aquareovirus (ARV)], and triple-layered [rhesus rotavirus (RRV), Bluetongue virus (BTV)] capsid.

The need to conserve endogenous RNA transcription and the structural diversities uncovered in our prior studies have led to our overall hypothesis: genomes of dsRNA viruses have diverged substantially to allow incorporation of RNA segments encoding the distinct proteins required to interact with different host cells, giving rise to different genome and TEC organizations and variations to both RNA unwinding during transcription and RNA capping during release.

Chronic rejection (CR) after heart transplant (HTx) is the principal barrier to long-term graft survival that results
in nearly 50% graft rejection after 10 years post-transplant (Tx). The factors driving CR are complex, as current
immunosuppressive regimes targeting lymphocytes fail to prevent progressive fibrotic scarring and occlusion of
graft vasculature. However, a known protagonist to the development of CR is prolonged graft ischemia
reperfusion injury (IRI) that triggers robust early inflammatory responses of graft infiltrating monocytes that react
to local inflammatory signals. Recently, it was established that monocytes and macrophages (MΦs) distinguish
non-self from self MHCI via paired-immunoglobulin-like receptors (PIRs), and direct innate recognition of
allogeneic H2-Dd by PIR-A promoted HTx rejection. MΦs are essential for resolving inflammation to promote
reparative responses that re-establishes graft homeostasis to preserve organ function, yet how MΦ alloantigen
recognition shapes or dysregulates the repair of grafts is completely unknown. I tested how MΦ recognition of
self or non-self coordinates their differentiation and demonstrated that mono-derived MΦ recognition of
allogeneic materials locally transforms them into pro-inflammatory Ly6chiCD86hi MΦs in wildtype, Rag2-/-γc-/-, and
Pira-/--Rag2-/-γc-/ B6 recipients-. My preliminary data further settled that recombinant H2-Dd promotes pro-
inflammatory differentiation in bone marrow-derived MΦs (BMDMΦs) and there were again no differences
between wildtype and Pira-/- BMDMΦs. Therefore, I tested whether MΦs express other H2-Dd receptors and my
preliminary data shows that blocking the receptor Ly49d extinguished H2-Dd-associated pathways. Lastly, I
determined the functional consequences of this MΦ allorecognition, and show that MΦ exposure to allogeneic,
but not syngeneic, amplifies their repair of fibroblasts. Therefore, my hypothesis is that recipient MΦs differentiate
into a pro-fibrotic subset due to Ly49d-induced signaling triggered by donor H2-Dd MHCI leading to dysregulated
repair and accelerated CR. I will directly test this hypothesis by addressing the following Specific Aims: 1.
Define how MΦ recognition of non-self H2-Dd shapes the transcriptome and metabolome to induce pro-
inflammatory MΦ differentiation. 2. Determine if preventing MΦ non-self MHCI recognition limits CR after IRI in
heart grafts. Completion of these aims will establish if Ly49d is a fundamental MΦ allorecognition receptor and
define pathways mediating pro-inflammatory MΦ differentiation to H2-Dd. I will also precisely determine whether
MΦ recognition of H2-Dd amplifies their pro-fibrotic roles, and if abolishing MΦ responses to non-self MHCI limits
CR to deliver effective graft repair. Contribution to Training: This proposal entails an extensive training plan to
elucidate MΦ alloimmune responses combined with superb mentorship in bioinformatics and biochemistry.
Together, the generated data will foster my professional development for conference talks and manuscript
preparation. It further integrates my interests in developing clinical targets for Tx patients and provides strong
foundations for my academic career by collaborating with world-renowned Tx researchers."

cardiovascular events (MACE). In OSA patients, plasma biomarkers associated with MACE such as highly
sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) are elevated. We have previously shown in the WTC-CHEST study
(NCT01466218) that presence or high risk of OSA is associated with elevated levels of hs-CRP. In the current
proposal, we will evaluate whether CV risk in these WTC-CHEST OSA subjects is similar to the general
population, and if hs-CRP is a predictor of MACE.
 Three distinct clinical phenotypes of OSA have been described: 1) a sleepy phenotype (2) a disturbed
sleep phenotype and 3) a minimally symptomatic phenotype. WTCGRC with OSA has almost a 50% prevalence
of the disturbed sleep phenotype in contrast to other populations with OSA, where the sleepy phenotype is
predominant.
 The pathophysiology of OSA is complex and multifactorial and has been described using
polysomnographically (PSG) determined endotypic traits: impaired upper airway anatomy, low arousal threshold,
high ventilatory loop gain and altered neuro-muscular control of upper airway muscles. Our preliminary data
shows that unlike in other populations, low arousal threshold endotype is the primary physiological endotype that
leads to OSA. However, the relationship between endotypes and clinical phenotypes are unknown. In this
proposal, we will determine whether the low arousal threshold physiological endotype is associated with
the “Disturbed Sleep” clinical phenotype. We will also examine the association between a recently developed
PSG index, the odds ratio product (ORP-9) that measures excessive overnight wakefulness and physiological
endotypes and clinical phenotypes as a biomarker of disturbed sleep.
 There have been no studies determining the association of clinical phenotypes of OSA and plasma hs-
CRP. Therefore, the third aim of this proposal will determine whether the “Disturbed Sleep” clinical
phenotype of OSA in the WTCGRC is associated with increases in plasma hs-CRP. Finally, we will
determine the relationship of hs-CRP with poor sleep quality in subjects without OSA but with other comorbidities
in the WTCGRC. The studies proposed in this project will significantly advance our understanding of the
consequences of poor sleep in the WTCGRC and will inform future screening recommendations for these
participants."
10885930,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Composed of a latticework of proteoglycans and associated molecules, the brain extracellular matrix (ECM) is
a medium for synaptic plasticity. The expression of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), most notably
aggrecan (gene: Acan), has been shown to mediate the closure of critical periods of plasticity through the
formation of perineuronal nets, structures thought to stabilize synaptic connections. Furthermore, enzymatic
digestion of hippocampal ECM results in contextual learning deficits, suggesting that ECM may stabilize
learning-related synaptic changes. The dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, a critical learning structure, has
abundant aggrecan in its molecular layer, and dentate gyrus granule cells (DG GCs) continuously produce
Acan mRNA in adulthood. Thus, aggrecan production by dentate gyrus neurons may underlie the stability of
memory processes.
Preliminary data presented here show that genetic deletion of Acan in dentate gyrus neurons results in remote
contextual discrimination deficits. This proposal will test the hypothesis that activity-dependent aggrecan
expression by DG GCs following learning is essential for DG ensemble separation and memory precision at
retrieval. First, the effect of contextual fear learning on DG GC Acan expression and deposition will be
characterized (Aim 1). Next, DG-specific Acan deletion will be used to test if aggrecan production is necessary
for recent or remote contextual memory precision (Aim 2). Lastly, using microendoscopic calcium imaging, I
will describe how aggrecan deletion changes DG GC ensemble properties (Aim 3). Altogether, this proposal
aims to elucidate the extracellular matrix's role in mammalian learning and memory and the underlying
molecular and network mechanisms. Furthermore, given that alterations to brain ECM are found in
neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions, understanding the physiologic properties of ECM may yield
insights into disease pathophysiology and potential therapeutic avenues.
These research goals will be realized in conjunction with a comprehensive training plan aimed at developing the
applicant’s career as a physician-scientist. This training will include consistent, rigorous mentorship in conceptual
and technical skills from two highly-qualified mentors, one of whom is a physician-scientist. The research and
training proposed here will be carried out at the University of California, San Francisco, which offers both a world-
class neuroscience research environment and an exceptional medical school for clinical training."

The long-term objective of this application is to develop innovative therapies for intracerebral hemorrhage
(ICH), which causes high rates of death and disability worldwide. This is consistent with the mission of NINDS.
This proposal aims to investigate the biological functions of fibroblast-derived laminin in blood-brain barrier
(BBB) repair and fibroblast biology after ICH and explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. In Aim 1, the
function of fibroblast-derived laminin in ICH pathogenesis will be investigated in two clinically relevant ICH
models using middle-aged transgenic mice with laminin deficiency in fibroblasts. In Aim 2, the function of
fibroblast-derived laminin in BBB repair after ICH will be investigated both in vitro and in vitro. First, how loss of
fibroblast-derived laminin affects BBB permeability and inflammatory cell infiltration after ICH will be examined
(Aim 2A). Next, whether loss of fibroblast-derived laminin exacerbates BBB disruption via paracellular and/or
transcellular mechanisms will be investigated (Aim 2B). Third, the receptors that mediate fibroblast-derived
laminin’s “BBB-repairing” effect on endothelial cells will be identified using both pharmacological and genetic
approaches (Aim 2C). In Aim 3, the function of fibroblast-derived laminin in fibroblast biology and fibrotic scar
composition will be investigated. First, fibroblast biology (proliferation/apoptosis/migration), fibroblast
morphology, and fibrotic scar components will be examined in vitro and in vivo (Aim 3A). Next, how exactly
fibroblast-derived laminin regulates fibroblast biology and fibrotic scar composition will be explored by bulk
and/or single-cell RNAseq analysis (Aim 3B). Third, the receptors that mediate these changes in fibroblasts will
be identified using both pharmacological and genetic approaches (Aim 3C). Successful completion of this
proposal will elucidate novel functions of fibroblast-derived laminin in BBB repair and fibroblast biology after
ICH, identify the receptors that mediate these effects on both endothelial cells and fibroblasts, provide new
molecular targets with therapeutic potential, and promote the development of innovative and effective
treatments for ICH."
10878745,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common, debilitating disorder, triggered by exposure to a traumatic
event. PTSD is often under-diagnosed and undertreated, despite early detection and treatment governing
favorable outcomes. Better identification of elements of disorder susceptibility or resilience is important for
prompt delivery of care to mitigate disorder burden. As PTSD has shown to be heritable, a prevailing theory of
disorder susceptibility is genetic. Large-scale genome wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed an
estimated single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability of 5-20%. Yet, environmental factors, such
as childhood trauma, have also shown to independently predict PTSD development. Genome-wide integration
of PTSD-associated genetic loci with stressful exposures may elucidate gene by environment interactions that
influence disorder susceptibility. In this proposal, I will investigate loci with joint genetic and environmental
contributions to PTSD risk, employing an integrative multi-level approach to examine and validate brain region
and cell type-specific regulation. One major issue integrating GWAS findings with environmental exposures is
the largely non-coding nature of GWAS-identified loci, obscuring clear functional ramifications. To overcome this,
I will associate identified variants with nearby expression changes to uncover regulation of proximal or distal
gene targets. Such variants with transcriptomic regulatory activity are termed expression quantitative trait loci
(eQTLs). As transcriptomic regulation is context-dependent, eQTLs capture genetically and environmentally
regulated expression, making them useful for deciphering genomic regulation of PTSD. I performed a preliminary
eQTL search in post-mortem brain samples from the dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex (DLPFC), demonstrating that
stress-interactive eQTLs are detectable in brains of trauma-exposed cohorts. In Aim 1, I will extend this analysis
beyond the DLPFC to the medial amygdala, to uncover the regulatory landscape of genetic stress response
across the brain. In Aim 2, I will examine causality of these variants to demonstrate stress-dependent regulation.
I have developed an in vitro model capturing PTSD-specific stress response. In this model, candidate effector
variants will be interrogated for downstream effects impacting disorder biology. This will be accomplished via
training in large scale CRISPR-screening methods and in computational probing of convergent downstream
pathways. This work will take place within the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) and Yale
University, currently ranked #11 and #10 among the nation’s best medical schools for research, respectively.
Between the Departments of Genetics and Neuroscience, I am supported by over 100,000 ft2 of research
programs and 4500 ft2 of institutional core facilities, in addition to over $200 million in scientific computing
resources. Together, this fellowship leverages the resources of my institutional and the expertise of my co-
sponsors to support my training in four major areas: (1) Scientific excellence, (2) professional development and
scholarship, (3) mentorship, leadership, and advocacy, (4) and clinical-research integration."
10883629,"Most ovarian cancer (OvCa) patients develop fatal chemotherapy-resistant disease. Elucidating mechanisms
of chemoresistance in OvCa may identify therapeutic targets to prevent or treat relapsed OvCa. One
understudied mechanism of chemotherapy resistance in OvCa is quiescence. Quiescent cells are transiently
non-proliferating and thus refractory to standard therapies which target rapidly proliferating cells. The over-
arching hypothesis of this project is that hypothesis is that understanding the biology of quiescent
OvCa cancer cells will identify critical new therapeutic targets to improve patient outcomes. We have
used multiple novel approaches to identify and characterize the transcriptional signature of quiescent OvCa
cells. This work indicates that quiescent OvCa (qOvCa) cells have several unique characteristics including: (i)
a unique Quiescence Associated Secretory Phenotype (QuASP) which drives chemotherapy resistance in non-
quiescent cancer cells, and (ii) altered expression of select components of the ubiquitin-proteosome system
(UPS) including induction of UBL7. Indeed, our preliminary data indicate that induction of UBL7 is sufficient to
drive a quiescent cell phenotype, including the expression of the QuASP. Bio-informatic analysis of quiescent
OvCa cell RNAseq data identified the SRF/MRTF transcription pathway as being inversely correlated with the
OvCa quiescent signature. Consistent with this, a small molecule inhibitor of SRF/MRTF-mediated
transcription, CCG081, (i) induces UBL7, (ii) drives cells into a dense quiescent state, and (iii), indicating a
critical role for the UPS in quiescent cell viability, CCG081 sensitizes OvCa cells to proteasome inhibitors.
Based on these discoveries, we propose: SA 1: To characterize the OvCa QuASP. We hypothesize that,
characterizing the QuASP will identify critical biologic factors related to quiescence. We will identify QuASP
factors, validate the expression of QuASP factors in ovarian cancer and other cancer types, and use
knockdown and neutralizing antibodies to evaluate the function of these factors in quiescent OvCa cells.SA 2:
To determine the role of the UPS and UBL7 in quiescent cancer cells. We hypothesize that UPS changes
contribute to the quiescent cell state and are essential for quiescent cell viability. We will identify which
components of the UPS contribute to the quiescent phenotype, including expression of the QuASP, and
determine if the proteosome is essential to maintain quiescent OvCa cell viability. Finally, we will SA 3:
Evaluate the impact of targeting the proteosome quiescent cells in vivo. We hypothesize that the ability to
pharmacologically force these residual cells into a quiescent state and then eliminate these quiescent cells via
proteosome inhibition will increase cure rates. We will evaluate the therapeutic potential of combined CCG081
and FDA-approved proteosome inhibitors as consolidative therapy after chemotherapy to eradicate residual
quiescent cells. Impact: We will define the regulators of OvCa cell quiescence, providing therapeutic targets
eradiate to improve patient outcomes."
10813778,"Abstract
Interactions between the cortex and thalamus are essential for sensation, action and cognition. Although the
role of the thalamus in sensory processing is well-studied, its role in cognition is just beginning to be
elucidated. This proposal will focus on the mediodorsal thalamus (MD), one of the largest thalamic nuclei of
the mammalian brain, in regulating prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity in cognitive control and flexibility. MD-PFC
interactions are known to be perturbed in schizophrenia, but therapeutic options are limited because the circuit
mechanisms underlying these interactions are unknown. In this proposal, we will test an overarching model
that the MD regulates PFC connectivity patterns to match the behavioral context through enhancement of
context-relevant activity patterns and suppression of context-irrelevant ones. Specifically, our model posits
that MD neurons generate context-specific signals by selectively strengthening PFC inputs that carry the basic
elements of these signals but do not encode the context explicitly. Two MD cell types appear to generate
such signals, one of which uses it to enhance context-congruent PFC activity while the other suppresses
context incongruent activity. Lastly, our model posits that these distinct thalamic effects are mediated by
different PFC circuit motifs, an excitatory/disinhibitory and an inhibitory, respectively. In Aim I, we will test the
hypothesis that MD neurons generate context-specific output based on context non-specific inputs from PFC.
In Aim II, we will test the hypothesis that the two MD functional cell types map onto distinct genetic types. In
Aim III, we will test the hypothesis that the two MD-dependent effects on PFC, enhancement and suppression
of activity patterns, are implemented by distinct local circuit motifs. Overall, our work should clarify the circuit
mechanisms by which the MD influences PFC activity, providing a starting point for examining their generality
across different task switching paradigms as well as relationship to higher order thalamus function more
broadly. Our work should also be relevant to central mission of the NIH in understanding mechanisms with
therapeutic potential."
10909306,"ABSTRACT
A pivotal stage of the ALD progression is the development of hepatic inflammation, which substantially increases
the risk for fibrosis, cirrhosis and cancer. Despite the recent surge in the use of immunomodulatory biologics for
other inflammatory diseases, corticosteroids remain the only therapeutic for hepatic inflammation, underscoring
a major unmet clinical need. While evidence indicates that a combination of ethanol-induced hepatocyte cell
death and elevated circulating endotoxin drives hepatic inflammation in ALD, a major question arising is how the
chronic low grade inflammation is initiated and amplified in the progression of ALD. We reported that low-dose
endotoxin induces the expression of Mincle, a member of the C-type lectin receptor family that acts as a sensor
for cell death, via the IRAKM-dependent TLR4 signaling in hepatic macrophages. Mincle detects components
released by dead hepatocytes and activates inflammasomes and IL-1β production, serving as a critical link
between cell death and inflammation in murine models of ALD. Recently, we found serum concentrations of β-
glucosylceramide (GluCer), a Mincle ligand released by dying hepatocytes, are increased by ethanol feeding in
mice and highly elevated in sera from patients with AH. GluCer concentrations were positively correlated with
disease severity in patients, suggesting that GluCer may be a major Mincle ligand driving hepatic inflammation
and fibrosis in ALD. Intriguingly, Mincle activation leads to a non-lytic form of IL-1β secretion from hepatic
macrophages and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) via a novel GSDMD-mediated biogenesis and release of small
extracellular vesicles (sEVs). The non-lytic IL-1β secretion spares hepatic macrophages from pyroptosis,
allowing them to continue amplifying the inflammatory response. Importantly, our preliminary data highlight a
critical pathogenic role for IL-1β containing sEVs in potentiating ethanol-induced liver injury in mice.
Mechanistically, we found that IL-1β induced the expression of SAA in hepatocytes, which in turn activated
caspase3-GSDME-mediated pyroptosis. Hepatocyte pyroptosis releases the danger signal HMGB1, which can
further activate caspase 1 and 11-dependent GSDMD-cleavage in neighboring hepatocytes, amplifying
hepatocyte injury. This escalation of injury not only impairs liver function but likely leads to further release of
GluCer, amplifying macrophage inflammatory responses. Importantly, our preliminary data reveal that GluCer
also activated HSCs, enhancing collagen deposition and aggravating liver fibrosis. By dissecting the GluCer-
Mincle-GSDMD-IL-1β-sEV cascade, this application will evaluate strategies and identify therapeutic targets to
interrupt this positive feed forward loop that amplifies the early stage hepatocyte cell death into debilitating
hepatic inflammation and fibrosis."

It is well established that there are racial disparities in mortality rates and postoperative outcomes following
coronary artery bypass graft with or without valvular replacement / repair (CABG/VR) surgery, particularly in
Non-Hispanic Black Americans compared to Non-Hispanic White Americans. Hospital quality and a lack of
guideline-concordant care (e.g., insulin infusions, timely antibiotics) are significant contributors; however, a large
fraction of this racial disparity remains unexplained. Sleep, circadian rhythm disruption, and impaired
glucoregulation may play a role in post-CABG/VR health disparities in Non-Hispanic Black Americans. These
disruptions may result in prolonged length of stay, postoperative convalescence, impaired immune function, and
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the purpose of this descriptive study is to examine sleep and
circadian rhythm characteristics and the relationships between sleep, circadian rhythm, and glucoregulation
among adults in the intensive care unit postoperative CABG/VR surgery. In Aim 1, we will determine between-
and within-person associations of sleep, circadian rhythm and glucoregulation associations among 30 adults
post-coronary artery bypass graft with or without valvular surgery (50% non-Hispanic Black and 50% non-
Hispanic White). Sleep and circadian characteristics will be described through the timing of behavioral
(actigraphy) measures. In Aim 2, we will compare sleep, circadian rhythm characteristics, and glucoregulation
between 15 individuals identifying as Non-Hispanic Black to 15 individuals identifying as Non-Hispanic White
post-coronary artery bypass graft with or without valvular surgery. Our central hypothesis is that higher sleep
and circadian disruption are associated with poorer glucoregulation and that there are sleep, circadian, and
glucoregulation racial disparities among individuals post-CABG/VR. The proposed F31 study and training plan
will provide a strong foundation in sleep and circadian rhythm health disparities. Promoting sleep and circadian
rhythm stability post-surgery through behavioral modifications may improve glucoregulation by reducing insulin
resistance, improving insulin sensitivity, and other short- and long-term postoperative outcomes in a population
where such clinical gains may otherwise be difficult to achieve. This study will provide information on a novel
potential contributor to racial disparities in coronary artery post-operative outcomes in the ICU where it is critical
to optimize glucoregulation. Additionally, these results will provide preliminary evidence to inform future
longitudinal and intervention studies to improve glucoregulation and postoperative outcomes in this understudied
population."

investigator and support the training of future physician scientists. My patient oriented research
interests relate to understanding the clinical, pathologic, genetic and pathomechanistic
underpinnings of inherited and acquired forms of muscle weakness. With the support of this
grant, I will continue to perform genetic discovery of patients with muscle disease, increase our
biorepository, resolve variants of unknown significance and understand the phenotypic
spectrum of these diseases. In addition, I will increase my mentorship responsibilities of
graduate students, resident physicians, fellows and junior faculty within the neuromuscular

will learn valuable skills related to mentorship and receive training related to diversity and
inclusion. A K24 grant would protect 50% effort and relieve future clinical and administrative
responsibilities. The two interrelated aims of this proposal are 1) Resolve variants of unknown
significance in LGMD genes. 2) Perform natural history studies related to rare muscle diseases.
These aims will be achieved utilizing our existing biorepository within the Washington University
School of Medicine Neuromuscular Genetics Project and the acquisition of new patients and
patient material. Support through a K24 Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented
Research would come at a critical time in my career as I solidify my independent research
program and increase my availability to mentor graduate students, post-doctoral fellows,
residents, neuromuscular fellows and junior faculty in translational myology. Upon completion
of this award, I will have integrated clinical trainees into our existing translational research
infrastructure and created a successful pipeline to generate the next generation of clinician-

10746396,"The bone marrow (BM) produces myeloid and lymphoid cells at a rate that ensures hematopoietic cell
homeostasis. How hematopoietic cell production is regulated to control the size of the peripheral hematopoietic
cell compartment is not understood. During systemic infection and/or inflammation, lymphoid production is
halted while myelopoiesis is increased, a process that is known as emergency myelopoiesis. How systemic
inflammatory signals alter the BM microenvironment to enable dramatic and quick hematopoietic shifts is also
largely unknown. We propose to address these fundamental questions by studying B cell development under
homeostasis and during systemic inflammation. Studies over the past 6 years identified Leptin receptor-
expressing mesenchymal progenitor cells (Lepr+ MPCs) as the major cells producing SCF, IL-7, and the
chemokine CXCL12, that are critical for hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and hematopoietic precursor
commitment into the lymphoid lineage. This type of niche organization suggests that cross-talk between
hematopoietic cells and Lepr+ MPCs occurs in vivo, but so far no specific signals delivered by hematopoietic
cells to Lepr+ MPCs have been identified. In this grant we provide evidence showing that Lepr+ MPCs express
Lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbR) and that LTbR signaling downregulates IL-7 production. Mature B cells that
naturally recirculate through BM express the LTbR ligand LTa1b2. Furthermore, while normal B cell
progenitors express little LTa1b2, pre-leukemic preB cells significantly up-regulate LTa1b2 and reduce IL-7
produced by Lepr+ MPCs in vivo. In aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that LTbR signaling in Lepr+ MPCs
regulates the quality and size of the B cell compartment. Our preliminary findings also revealed that Lepr+
MPCs significantly reduce IL-7 expression during systemic inflammation in a LTbR-dependent manner.
Importantly, when Lepr+ MPCs cannot shut-down IL-7 production, B lymphocytes continue to be made, and
myeloid cell production is significantly reduced. Remarkably, survival against a high dose of Listeria
monocytogenes infection is critically dependent on LTbR signaling. Through experiments described in Aim 2
we will test the hypothesis that LTbR signaling in Lepr+ MPCs is the major molecular pathway controlling
emergency myelopoiesis. Finally, as CXCL12 production is quickly reduced during systemic inflammation,
most hematopoietic cells are rapidly mobilized from BM into the periphery, with the notable exception of mature
B cells that double in number in BM in the early hours after inflammation. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis
that mature B cells play a novel and unsuspected role in innate immunity through BM homing and interaction
with Lepr+ MPCs for delivery of “instructive” LTbR signaling in these cells. We also propose to study the
mechanism(s) used by mature B cells to home and be temporarily retained in BM during systemic
inflammation. The proposed aims will provide a broad conceptual and mechanistic framework for
understanding how bone marrow stromal cells influence cell lineage decisions."

The goal of this study is to test the efficacy of a theoretically informed, school-based intervention for sexual and
gender minority (SGM, e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) adolescents, Proud & Empowered (P&E).
Studies found that SGM students are 8 to 10 times more likely to experience victimization in schools than
heterosexuals, with rates even higher among transgender youth. This bias-based victimization, part of which is
commonly known as minority stress, has been cited as a participating factor in the substantial behavioral health
disparities SGM face when compared to their heterosexual counterparts, such as depression, anxiety, self-harm,
and suicidal ideation and attempt. These disparities are unique to SGM, as when compared to similarly victimized
non-SGM peers, victimized SGM adolescents report significantly higher rates of suicide. When schools lack
SGM bullying policies, SGM students are more likely to report suicidality than peers in schools with protective
policies. Studies also indicate that SGM victimization is more common in schools that lack protective policies
and resources such as gender and sexuality alliances (GSAs), SGM-specific antibullying guidelines, teacher and
staff training, and openly supportive allies. Therefore, it is clear that any intervention for SGM youth must
simultaneously (a) help SGM youth cope with the effects of minority stress and (b) work to reduce the likelihood
of future victimization by addressing school-level factors. The P&E intervention seeks to address these outcomes
through a novel multi-level school-based intervention. Supported by nine years of research including an NIH-
supported feasibility study conducted at four schools (1R21MD013971), we will determine the interventions'
efficacy by completing three specific aims: 1) Determine participant-level efficacy of the intervention in an RCT
with 24 schools. 2) Determine the schoolwide intervention effects on (a) reporting of minority stress and
behavioral health outcomes among all SGM students and (b) perceptions of school climate (i.e., norms, attitudes,
beliefs, bullying behavior toward SGMA, policies) among all students. 3) Examine factors that may affect
intervention success (e.g., fidelity of implementation, barriers or facilitators to implementation, school or student
characteristics) to prepare the intervention for future dissemination. Following the completion of all ten P&E
sessions, school-level factors will be addressed by student-led implementation of environmental change
strategies at the school focused on key domains of school climate: safety, relationships, teaching and learning,
and institutional environment. This innovative R01 application brings together a team of nationally recognized
minority stress and prevention science experts and responds to a nationally established public health need for
research from the National Academy of Medicine, the National Institutes of Health (NOT-MD-19-001), and the
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force."
10896957,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Adolescence is a key risk period for depression and anxiety, and adolescent-onset psychopathology is
predictive of poorer health and life outcomes. Functional connectivity (FC) networks, which reflect trait-like
brain functioning, have emerged as a promising biomarker to inform diagnosis and intervention of
psychopathology. However, despite findings of FC differences between clinical and control groups, particularly
in resting state (RS) networks, there has been minimal clinical translation. A key limitation is that qualitative
network heterogeneity between- and within-individuals threatens the ability to draw inferences valid at the
individual level. At the between-person level, qualitatively distinct networks across individuals limit the ability of
group-averaged networks to validly reflect each individual. If group-level networks do not reflect individuals,
behavioral inferences drawn from them will not apply to the individual. Our preliminary work and previous
precision imaging studies provide evidence of this limitation by demonstrating FC network heterogeneity
across individuals. However, the generalizability of group networks to individuals is yet to be tested empirically.
This proposal will assess group-to-individual generalizability of adolescent RS networks and examine the
ability of data-driven subgroups of similar individuals to address the limitation of heterogeneity (Aim 1). At the
within-person level, FC variability across a single scan also threatens the validity of FC networks. If FC means
and covariances vary with time across a scan (i.e., are not stationary), a static (time-invariant) network would
not validly reflect network processes across the scan. This proposal will estimate dynamic FC to assess
stationarity of adolescent RS networks to determine the validity of static networks (Aim 2). For both aims, this
proposal will use a large 11–12-year-old sample from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study. The
proposal will determine the levels of data aggregation (group, subgroup, or individual) and time precision (static
or dynamic) necessary for individual-level inferences from FC networks. Findings will be critical for the ultimate
goal of using FC networks for clinical translation, which requires individual-level prediction. We will then use
RS network features that are precise to individuals to predict depression and anxiety outcomes in adolescents
(Aim 3), building a foundation with increased potential for clinical translation. The training plan to achieve the
proposed project was developed in collaboration with a team of relevant experts that consists of formal
coursework, workshops, and applied research activities. Specifically, I will develop expertise in fMRI research
and analysis methods, machine learning approaches for subgroup identification, and idiographic (person-
centered) methods necessary to complete the research proposal. Training will emphasize development toward
my goal of becoming an independent investigator in clinical neuroscience who studies individually precise
associations between neural functioning and adolescent psychopathology."
10903743,"ABSTRACT. Healthy child development is essential to long-term wellness because it enables human capacity
to participate in economic, social, and civic life; however, not all children experience healthy development. Many
children are affected by social determinants of health (SDOH) including structural inequities resulting from their
neighborhood environment. Neighborhood environment, a powerful SDOH, profoundly shapes children's
physical, mental, and emotional health, and influences opportunities for children to achieve long-term health.
Parents who reside in poorer neighborhoods also tend to experience ineffective coping, parenting challenges,
and suboptimal family cohesion, which may influence behavioral dysregulation and academic performance in
early childhood. Behavioral dysregulation – an impairment in ability to self-regulate behaviors characterized by
reflexive, automatic, and emotional reaction of acting out – is associated with the development of common
childhood psychopathologies. In addition, behavioral dysregulation is associated with poor academic
performance, another important indicator of long-term child health. Studying these outcomes in early childhood
provides windows of opportunity to find solutions to promote life-long health and close the gap on health
disparities later in life. Parenting behavior and family cohesion (positive relationships between family members
and the level of closeness, emotional bonding, and support) are modifiable indicators of family relationships that
can be targeted to mitigate the effect of neighborhood environment on child behavioral dysregulation. In this
NRSA F31 proposal, using rich publicly available data from the Environmental Influences on Child Health
Outcomes (ECHO) Program, I will adopt the Creating Nurturing Environments framework to address the following
specific aims: 1) Identify the effect of neighborhood environment on behavioral dysregulation and academic
performance in early childhood (1-6 years); 2) Determine the degree to which family relationships mediate the
effect of neighborhood environment on behavioral dysregulation and academic performance. The accompanying
career development plan will build the foundation for me to a) Build expertise in child development with
emphasis on behavioral health and academic performance; b) Build expertise in neighborhood environment and
its effect on child health; c) Advance skills in quantitative research methods for data analysis such as structural
equation modeling; d) Gain experience in team science skills and accomplish professional development goals.
I have a strong mentorship team who are influential in their respective fields with robust NIH-funding and
publications, dedicated to my growth and development throughout this F31 award and my career. The career
development and research plan will guide me to achieve my ultimate career goal of becoming an independent
nurse scientist who advances the science in addressing SDOH and promoting child health. This proposal aligns
with the new NINR Strategic Plan with its focus to understand SDOH to promote health equity in neighborhoods
with shared characteristics of strengths and vulnerabilities."

Pair bonds play critical roles in the human experience and profoundly influence our physical and emotional
health. For a bond to be beneficial and the pair to accomplish shared goals, partners must work together
through reciprocal action where each person acts and the other responds in turn. Despite the dyadic nature of
pair bonds, the vast majority of studies on pair bonding focus on only one member of a pair, leaving us with an
impoverished view of the dynamics between partners that facilitate relationship success. To fill this knowledge
gap, I will use pair bonding prairie voles to examine the behavioral and biological basis of pair bonding in both
partners of bonded pairs. My preliminary data show that in prairie voles, partners organize their affiliative
behavior as bonds mature. In this proposal, I will use computational techniques to examine the discrete
elements that underlie organized intra-pair behavior at two levels of biological organization: behavior and
transcription. In my first Aim, I will leverage machine learning algorithms to decipher the within-animal and
between-animal behavioral sequences that partners exhibit when allowed to interact freely with each other.
This will reveal the behavioral components that contribute to intra-pair behavioral organization. To determine
the neuromolecular basis of this behavior, in my second Aim, I will use single nucleus RNA sequencing
(snRNA-seq) to map the transcriptional landscape of the prairie vole nucleus accumbens (NAc) and medial
prefrontal cortex (mPFC), two brain regions critical for pair bonding. snRNA-seq will enable me to identify
changes to discrete cellular populations upon bonding and will allow me to compare the similarity of
transcriptional landscapes between bonded partners, potentially revealing a role for transcriptional
convergence in the organization of intra-pair behavior. Together, these Aims will provide a new, dual-
individual lens through which we can understand pair bonding and will provide me with training in the
computational analysis of behavior and transcriptomics, invaluable skills for my career as an independent
researcher."
10885931,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Exposure to early childhood adversity is associated with a range of negative health outcomes including
increased risk of psychopathology across the lifespan. In particular, those who are exposed to environmental
threat (e.g., abuse from caregivers, community violence) are at elevated risk for mental health disorders,
particularly depression, that become more prevalent as youth transition to adolescence. Theory and research
have tried to account for the variability in outcomes of youth exposed to adversity by identifying mechanisms
linking early threat exposure to later functioning. Prominent contemporary models of adversity suggest that
exposure to threatening early environments sensitizes neural and psychological systems involved in emotion
processing and stress responsivity in ways that promote adaptation while also increasing risk for later
emotional hyper-reactivity and psychopathology. However, the majority of research to date has focused on
links between sensitivity to emotional cues and risk for psychopathology, neglecting the ways that sensitivity to
the environment – particularly the social environment, which becomes more salient during adolescence – may
support adaptation among threat-exposed adolescents. Further, research to date has examined concurrent
associations between neural activation and psychopathology, neglecting the role of integration across brain
networks and associations with trajectories of development over time. The proposed research will provide
training in adversity research, neural network modeling, and longitudinal statistical analysis while examining
the effect of early threat exposure on neural sensitivity to social-emotional information and subsequent
psychosocial outcomes in adolescents. Two main aims guide this research: (1) exploring whether childhood
threat exposure predicts heightened neural and behavioral sensitivity to negative and positive social cues; and
(2) exploring how this heightened sensitivity interacts with peer experiences to predict changes in depression
and social-emotional wellbeing over time. These aims will be addressed in a large longitudinal study of
adolescents (expected n = 275) who will complete self-report measures and a social feedback functional
magnetic resonance imaging task. Resources that will support this research include access to this rich sample,
facilities for neuroimaging and behavioral assessment, and a mentorship team with expertise in adversity
science and developmental neuroscience. Findings from this project will enrich theory regarding how youth
develop following threat exposure and identify strengths that can be leveraged to prevent psychopathology and
support wellbeing among adversity-exposed adolescents."

The reasons for individual variability in the physiologic response to dietary patterns are not well understood but
hamper efforts to provide optimum diets to our population. There is an urgent need to understand the complex
interaction of demographic, genetic, metabolic, behavioral, psychosocial, and environmental factors that affect
the responses to dietary patterns in order to prevent and treat nutrition-related chronic diseases. The field of
“precision nutrition” holds great promise for elucidating these interactions to eventually predict the optimal diet
for an individual or groups of individuals. The overall objective of this application is to demonstrate that the
University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) is uniquely positioned to join the consortium as a Nutrition for
Precision Health Clinical Center (RFA-RM-21-005). The study team will collect a wide range of physiological and
metabolic data from individuals in response to free-living (module 1) and controlled diets (modules 2 & 3), that
will be used in analyses to determine potential predictors of response to diet. Sophisticated data methods
(artificial intelligence, machine learning, mathematical modelling) will then be employed by the study group to
identify the comprehensive phenotypes needed for individualizing diet prescriptions. We aim to accomplish the
following three specific aims: Specific Aim 1 (module 1): Conduct an observational study of 2000 free-living
individuals consuming their usual diet for 14 days. The physiologic responses to a standardized test meal
challenge will be assessed while they are consuming their usual diet. Specific Aim 2 (module 2): Conduct a
free-living controlled feeding study in 400 subjects fed three isocaloric diets varying in macronutrient
composition at maintenance energy requirements. Diets are designed to elicit a wide range of responses
among participants. The physiologic responses to standardized test meals and diet-specific meals will be
measured at the end of each 14-day diet period. We will also collect measures of 24-hr glucose, 24-hr blood
pressure, 24-hr physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, and sleep during each diet period. Specific Aim 3
(module 3): Conduct a domiciled controlled feeding study in 150 subjects of three isocaloric diets (same
diets as in aim #1) fed at maintenance energy requirements. In addition to module 2 outcomes, assessments
including room calorimetry, doubly labelled water, cardiorespiratory fitness, and muscle and fat biopsies will be
completed in module 3 participants while they are domiciled in cottages at the Lakeshore Foundation Campus
near UAB. Achieving these aims will create a database that allows sophisticated data analysis (e.g., AI, machine
learning) to develop algorithms to match people to optimum diets. UAB, with access to >16,000 All of Us
participants in Birmingham, outstanding facilities for conducting diet interventions, and an outstanding
research team, can be a valued member of the Nutrition for Precision Health Consortium."

Many surgical insults—such as lymph node dissection and lymph node biopsy —can cause damage to the
lymphatic vessels, particularly when combined with radiotherapy, resulting in long-term lymphatic dysfunction
and the formation of lymphedema. Understanding the mechanisms of lymphatic regeneration after surgery and
cancer treatment is crucial to prevent lymphedema and develop efficient lymphedema therapy. Despite the
prevalence of lymphedema, it is not clear whether collecting vessels remodel/regenerate post-injury and
mechanisms of such growth and remodeling response are unknown. A disrupted lymphatic network induces
sustained fluid loads in the remaining network that drives lymphatic dysfunction. Improper collateralization and
collecting vessel remodeling due to sustained loads can cause a maladaptive remodeling response. Here I aim
to develop an understanding of lymphatic vessel remodeling, repair and dysfunction in the context of a disrupted
network using sophisticated lymphatic imaging, complex mouse models, and computational modeling. I will
investigate the mechanisms and modes by which lymph flow drives lymphatic remodeling and regrowth. I will
test whether collecting lymphatic vessels regrow/remodel following injury and determine the effect of lymph flow
on this response (Aim 1). I will also test whether there is a causal relationship between altered lymph flow and
activation of lymphangiogenic pathways using genetic mouse models. Further, I will determine the dynamics of
collateral growth at the injury site in the context of a disrupted network and altered lymph flow in our mouse
model (Aim 2). I will also use a 3D culture system to study the dynamics of collateral growth from pre-existing
collecting vessels under flow and pressure conditions in vitro. Computational modeling will complement Aim 2 to
better understand the relationship between structural remodeling and alteration of lymph flow dynamics. With
the completion of this project, I will provide insight into preventive strategies and better therapeutic interventions
for lymphedema therapy.
I have extensive training in lymphatic bioengineering, lymphatic imaging, image processing, isolated lymphatic
vessel experiments and computational modeling from my doctoral training. This project will leverage this training
in the labs of my postdoctoral advisors—Dr. Padera and Dr. Munn—who are leaders in the field of lymphatic
research and biology. Dr Padera’s lab has developed state-of-the-art lymphatic imaging tools to precisely
measure lymph flow rate, dynamic intravital microscopy of lymph nodes and animal models of lymphatic
diseases. Dr Munn’s lab has developed in vitro models of angiogenesis, computational models of angiogenesis
and lymphatic transport, bioengineered cell-culture systems and image processing tools to track cells. This
unique training environment will allow me to successfully complete the aims of this proposal."

 Inflammation serves a protective role in the body to fight infection and mediate wound healing;
however, the inflammatory response can become deleterious if left uncontrolled or unresolved. Most pathology,
including atherosclerosis, vasculitis, and ischemia/reperfusion injury—which can exacerbate potential
comorbidities such as myocardial infarcts and stroke—is due to dysfunctional inflammation. Targeting
inflammation could thus provide the means to combat inflammatory disease. This objective can be realized by
targeting a common process that underlies all inflammation: the directed movement of white blood cells
(WBCs) from circulation into affected tissue. In this process, transendothelial migration (TEM), WBCs migrate
between lateral borders of endothelial cells (ECs) lining blood vessels to enter sites of inflammation. TEM is a
critical step in the inflammatory response as it is the ultimate step preceding WBC access to inflamed tissue.
Successful blocking of TEM would preclude tissue damage in an inflammatory context and is thus a
therapeutic goal.
 TEM is mediated by interactions between surface adhesion molecules on the WBC and ECs, resulting
in signaling within ECs that traffics membrane from the EC lateral border recycling compartment (LBRC), a
perivascular vesiculotubular structure, to the site of TEM. This provides additional surface area required for
WBC migration between adjacent ECs. Trafficking of LBRC is the final common pathway for TEM regardless of
WBC type or inflammatory stimulus. Blocking critical adhesion molecules or downstream EC signaling
pathways blocks TEM of WBC by 80-90% in vitro and in vivo. However, residual transmigration rate remains
10-20%, raising the question as to whether specific subpopulation(s) of WBC are resistant to TEM blockade
and whether non-blocked WBCs use alternative signaling pathways to recruit the LBRC to transmigrate.
 AIM I will phenotypically characterize monocytes that overcome TEM blockade to determine if they
represent a distinct monocyte subset. I will interrogate the mechanism by which these cells transmigrate in an
in vitro TEM model and in murine models of inflammation. This will allow for the identification of surface
receptors/signaling pathways that can be targeted to block the exit of all circulating monocytes from the
vasculature in situations in which blocking 100% of inflammation is critical. AIM II will interrogate mechanisms
that allow these monocytes to use alternative transmigration pathways. I will utilize a guided in vitro screening
approach and in vivo real time intravital confocal microscopy to validate my in vitro results by inspecting
mechanisms functioning at the TEM step directly. The project will shed light on alternative TEM pathways that
may be important under some pathologic conditions and alert us to ways in which the body may compensate
for the chronic blockade of traditional TEM pathways."
