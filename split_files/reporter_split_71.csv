Over 75% of people with Parkinson's disease (PD) have significant sleep-wake disturbances that are major
contributors to decreased quality of life and can be more disabling and resistant to treatment than the motor
symptoms of PD. Currently, the mechanisms contributing to disordered sleep in people with PD are poorly
understood and there is a critical need for therapeutic inventions to improve sleep quality. This project will provide
new insight into the pathophysiology of sleep-wake disturbances in PD by characterizing the changes in sleep-
related neuronal activity and physiological interactions that occur between subcortical and cortical structures in
the basal ganglia thalamocortical (BGTC) circuit during progressively more severe parkinsonian states. We will
expand our previous work to include the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) given its critical role regulating sleep-
wake states and extensive connectivity to the BGTC, exploring the changes in coupling and connectivity that
occur within and across the BGTC-PPN network that underlie disordered sleep in PD secondary to dopaminergic
loss in the substantia nigra (Aim 1). It will compare how deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the STN, GPi, and GPe
modifies subcortical-cortical interactions in the BGTC-PPN circuit to influence sleep-wake behavior and elucidate
the fiber pathway activations underlying these changes (Aims 2 and 3). This study will provide data with
immediate translational value by identifying whether DBS in one target is more effective than another in
normalizing sleep-related neuronal activity and improving sleep-wake behavior. Furthermore, knowledge about
how changes in neuronal activity across the BGTC-PPN network correlates with altered sleep from normal,
parkinsonian, and parkinsonian+DBS conditions will provide the basis to develop more effective stimulation
strategies that utilize target-specific physiological biomarkers and closed-loop DBS control paradigms tailored to
individual patient's sleep disturbances. These data will also provide the basis to target specific pathways with
DBS to optimize sleep-related outcomes in PD."

 Cholera continues to be a major cause of global morbidity and mortality, with continuing spread into
new areas and recurrences in areas thought to be free of cholera, driven by draught, flood, war, mass
population movements, and the associated breakdown of public health infrastructure. Haiti was the site of a
major cholera epidemic beginning in 2010, with over 820,000 reported cases and close to 10,000 deaths. No
clinical cases from this initial epidemic were reported after February 2019, and in 2022 it was announced that
cholera had been “eliminated” from Haiti. However, on September 25, 2022, cholera cases were again
identified, with 64,618 suspect cholera cases and 60,171 hospitalizations subsequently reported.
 In collaboration with GHESKIO, Haiti’s leading medical research institute, we have sequenced Vibrio
cholerae strains isolated from patients infected during the “new” 2022/2023 epidemic. Our genetic analysis
indicates that the epidemic strain originated from an “older” Haitian V. cholerae serogroup Ogawa strain that
had been circulating at sub-epidemic levels in the aquatic environment, rather than from more recent clinical
serogroup Inaba isolates or from strains introduced from outside of the country. These findings raise critically
important (and controversial) questions about the impact of strain and ecologic factors on persistence of
environmental foci of V. cholerae; factors influencing spread of epidemic disease within the Haitian population;
and best approaches to long-term cholera prevention, in Haiti and similar settings globally.
 Haiti provides a unique environment in which to address questions related to cholera: it is on an island,
with an initial epidemic caused by introduction of a single well characterized strain in 2010. Since 2010 we
have established a strong infrastructure in Haiti for cholera research with excellent local collaborators and have
built extensive environmental and clinical databases. The current study focuses on understanding factors
driving re-emergence of the disease after three years of quiescence, including use of causal Artificial
Intelligence (AI) to see if it is possible to model/predict the occurrence of future epidemic waves.
Specific Aim 1: Identify strain characteristics and ecologic factors that influence evolution, virulence, and
survival of V. cholerae O1 in environmental reservoirs, through environmental studies and evolutionary-
informed laboratory microcosm model systems.
Specific Aim 2: Monitor levels of exposure/immunity to V. cholerae O1 in communities and case cohorts to
determine rates of infection in the population and monitor waning of immune responses.
Specific Aim 3: Assess phylogeographic and phylodynamic patterns driving evolution of V. cholerae from
clinical and environmental sources.
Specific Aim 4: Develop a causal AI approach to predict the occurrence of future epidemic waves and
estimate effectiveness of interventions."

Peripheral arterial disease is a serious manifestation of atherosclerosis in the lower
extremities. Current interventions approved by FDA are either ineffective or have a
modest effect. Surgical revascularization is the only viable option for PAD subjects;
however, the stents can fail. Patients with PAD have marked defects in skeletal muscle
metabolism, where the aerobic and anaerobic metabolism are uncoupled, increased
acidification of the skeletal muscle and decreased ATP synthesis. In glycolytically active
tissue, such as skeletal muscle, there are present histidyl dipeptides, such as carnosine
which buffers intracellular pH, under ischemic conditions and facilitate the utilization of
glucose during exercise and ischemia. Recent evidence from our laboratory shows that
in addition to buffering, carnosine chelates first transition metals and improves
angiogenesis, forms conjugates with reactive aldehydes derived from lipid peroxidation
and regress atherosclerosis. Hence enhancing carnosine via supplementation, which
easily permeates through the ischemic muscle, is easily could be a feasible therapeutic
that can target the underlying pathophysiological associated with PAD and increase limb
function. To achieve this goal, we will treat the PAD subjects with carnosine and examine
whether the carnosine supplementation improves the lower extremity function. Second,
we will perform extensive mechanistic studies to elucidate the mechanism by which
carnosine improves the muscle function and finally we will follow these subjects and
determine if carnosine has durable effects. Collectively, our pilot clinical trial will help us
test the efficacy of carnosine as a low-cost therapeutic intervention for PAD patients and
the data generated will serve as a strong rationale to design large definitive Phase III
clinical trial for carnosine."

Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is one of the most common types of intracranial hemorrhage,
affecting 3.4-5/100,000 per year in the general population and 60-80/100,000 aged 65+ and its incidence
is rising in the older population. Treatment is performed by draining the hematoma, but as many as 30%
of the cases reform hematomas with a mean timeline of about 1.5 months. Previous studies have worked
to find clinical biomarkers to predict risk of hematoma and its recurrence so that the clinical care team can
focus their efforts on these more complex cases. Previously identified biomarkers include age, hematoma
density (as viewed on a CT scan), and blood markers of inflammation; however, another significant factor
is the subdural space and lack of reexpansion of tissue after treatment. Previous literature using invasive
methods has suggested that the elastance of the brain surface around the hematoma may provide a strong
prediction of the ability of the brain to expand to fill the space of the evacuated hematoma. In this project,
we will leverage recently developed magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) methods that quantitatively
and non-invasively measure the brain mechanical properties of stiffness and damping ratio to correlate
with characteristics of the hematoma (size and density) along with reexpansion of the brain 1 month after
treatment. We will examine a set of 40 patients with a CSDH diagnosis, collecting standard clinical
measures of hematoma size, density, clinical symptoms, and blood markers of inflammation. In addition,
we will collect a high-resolution MRE data set 1 month after treatment that will provide spatial maps of
stiffness and damping ratio of the patient’s brain. We will examine the mechanical properties of the brain
in areas adjacent to the hematoma, along with a contralateral control area, to determine the correlative
value of these measures for hematoma size and density along with brain tissue reexpansion. We will also
examine the relationships between brain mechanical properties and the other clinical biomarkers of
recurrence from previous literature through a factor analysis to determine the correlations with other
measures and the uniqueness of the information provided through MRE for this condition. This line of
research will have an important positive impact because it has the potential to provide a strong predictor
of brain reexpansion after treatment for CSDH and hence risk of recurrence. The project will lay the
foundation for more individualized treatments in complex cases that are likely to recur."
10988959,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The glucocerebrosidase 1 (GBA1) gene is the most common genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD)
and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). The L444P mutation is the most frequent occurrence and is known
to cause early onset and severe forms of PD and DLB. A deficiency in the functional enzyme, GBA1, occurs
in lysosomes due to misfolded GCase not properly transferring to the lysosomes and instead being retained
in the ER. The accumulation of misfolded mutant GCase leads to ER stress, which in turn causes GCase to
move to the cytoplasm and interact and stabilize soluble α-synuclein (α-syn) oligomers. This accelerates the
formation of pathological α-syn in PD pathology. The evidence linking GBA1 mutations to PD and DLB has
sparked interest in researching GCase as a target for therapy. Enzyme replacement therapy is the most
commonly used approach, but it has limitations in crossing the blood-brain barrier. Substrate reduction
therapy has also seen limited success in clinical trials. An alternative approach, using molecular chaperones
to aid the misfolded GCase and increase its translocation to lysosomes, has gained attention. This has led
to the screening of both pharmacological and small molecule chaperones for their ability to cross the blood-
brain barrier, making it a promising therapeutic strategy for PD and DLB. Discovered chaperones, both
inhibitory and non-inhibitory, through high-throughput screening (HTS) have demonstrated an improvement
in GCase activity, however, many have failed to be effective in clinical trials. This may be due to the limitations
of the model used for screening. The use of recombinant wild-type GCase and patient-derived fibroblasts
that do not accurately represent the mutant protein, as well as the tissue-specific expression of the protein to
reflect disease pathology, has limitations. HTS using patient-derived iPSCs can provide more accurate
results, but it is a labor-intensive and costly process to screen large libraries. To address these challenges,
we have devised an economical genetic model that employs low substrate concentration in SH-SY5Y cells
carrying the L444P mutation. This is supported by a platform that integrates fluorescence-based assay and
flow cytometry to assess GCase activity. In Aim 1, we will perform an initial screening of 11,280 small
molecule compounds to boost GCase activity using the SH-SY5Y GBA1L444P/L444P and GBA1L444P/+ cell lines.
Additionally, our aim is to select the top 5 hit compounds through secondary screening of the top 10. In Aim
2, we will assess the efficacy of these 5 hit compounds in alleviating the disease symptoms in human
dopaminergic (hDA) neurons with GBA1L444P/L444P mutation. We will prioritize assessing the efficacy of the top
five hit compounds in rescuing impaired differentiation of neuronal progenitor cells with the GBA1L444P/L444P
mutation into hDA neurons considering the time and budget constraints of the R03 award. This research will
lead to the identification of innovative drug candidates for treating GBA1-related PD/DLB and sporadic
PD/DLB, and it will also offer a new platform for drug screening for patients with this condition."

Both the total number of elderly persons and the incidence of lung disease will increase in the coming decades.
It is vital that we define the normal physiological changes that take place in the aging respiratory system. Peak
lung function occurs in early adulthood and progressively declines with age. The decreased lung function is
readily apparent in the maximal expiratory flow volume curve (MEFV), depicting decreases in maximal expiratory
airflow (MEF) at all lung volumes in elderly adults. Clinically, the reduced MEF is attributed to a concomitant,
progressive loss of lung elastic recoil. However, in young-to-middle aged adults, the inhalation to total lung
capacity that precedes a maximal forced expiration causes a transient airway dilation. The deep inflation-induced
airway dilation results in higher MEF than can be achieved in the absence of the deep inflation (DI). The effects
of normal aging on the dynamic interaction between a DI and MEF is not known. This is problematic, since the
MEFV curve is interpreted assuming that the airway response to a DI is equal across the aging spectrum. We
hypothesize that one cause of the decreased MEF with aging is a blunted airway dilatory effect of a DI. If this
hypothesis is true, it would indicate that the MEFV curve exaggerates the reduced MEF in elderly adults. Three
specific aims will test our hypothesis. Aim 1 will compare the effect of a DI on the MEFV curve in young and
elderly adults. We hypothesize that a DI will increase MEF in young adults whereas it will decrease MEF in
elderly adults. The effect of a DI on airway caliber will be quantified by comparing MEF after a DI with MEF during
a forced expiration begun at normal end-inspiratory lung volume (maximal:partial [M:P]). All M:P measurements
will be analyzed at 40% of vital capacity. Aim 2 will determine the effect of aging on the bronchodilatory effect of
a DI. In young adults, a DI exerts a bronchodilatory effect on airways that have been constricted by inhaled
methacholine (airway smooth muscle agonist). We hypothesize that the bronchodilatory effect of a DI will be
reduced in elderly adults. Inhaled methacholine will be used to cause bronchoconstriction. M:P measurements
will be used to determine the magnitude of DI-induced bronchodilation (as in SA1). If findings support our
hypothesis, they will provide evidence that aging is associated with the loss of an essential mechanism for
preserving airway function. Aim 3 will compare airway distensibility in young and elderly adults. We hypothesize
that airway distensibility will be lower in elderly adults than young adults. Using impulse oscillometry, airway
distensibility will be quantified as the change in airway conductance relative to the change in lung volume
(∆Grs/∆VL), [l·cmH2O-1·s-1·l-1]). These experiments will generate insight into the effects of aging on the strength
of coupling between the airways and the surrounding elastic tissues. This proposal will generate novel data
that addresses the question: Is interpretation of the MEFV curve inaccurate in elderly patients? The
findings will lend insight into the mechanisms for the maladaptive changes to lung function with aging and might
significantly impact clinical interpretation of spirometry in elderly adults."
10989331,"Multiple hereditary exostoses (MHE) is an autosomal dominant disorder that affects one in every 50,000 children
worldwide and is characterized by the formation of cartilage-capped osteochondromas, known as exostoses,
adjacent to the growth plates of long bones and other skeletal elements. Due to their location and size, exostoses
can cause skeletal deformities, growth retardation, chronic pain, and undergo malignant transformation in ~5%
of the patients. Currently, there are no approved treatments for this disorder besides surgery and pain
management; therefore, there is an urgent need to discover novel therapeutic targets to prevent and/or slow the
progression of the disease. Greater than 90% of cases are caused by heterozygous loss-of-function genetic
mutations in exostosin-1 (EXT1) or exostosin-2 (EXT2), genes that encode enzymes responsible for the
biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HS), which can lead to truncation of the HS chains and a consequent decrease
in HS levels in various tissues. Current evidence suggests that a decrease in HS content disrupts multiple
signaling pathways through which growth factors regulate the organization and function of chondrocytes in the
growth plate. Regardless of the mechanism, the primary defect is haploinsufficiency in EXT1 or EXT2, which
results in lower HS levels and leads to the formation of exostoses. To date, very little is known about the upstream
and downstream factors that regulate the expression and function of EXT1 and EXT2 in human cells.
Interestingly, there are also numerous patients lacking mutations in these genes, suggesting that heritable
alterations in other factors contribute to exostoses formation in MHE patients. Our previous studies have
revealed defined transcriptional and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms of HS biosynthesis in cells. The central
hypothesis of this proposal is that other factors exist that regulate EXT expression and are viable drug targets
for the restoration of HS levels and reduction of exostoses in MHE patients. Since a deficiency in HS is a key
component of MHE, we propose that over-stimulating the expression of the normal EXT allele to compensate for
the activity of the mutant allele could be a novel therapeutic approach to restore functionally normal levels of HS
in cells. The goal of this proposal is to leverage our experience in uncovering regulatory factors of HS formation
to adapt genome-wide screening assays to identify genes that control EXT1/EXT2 expression for drug target
discovery for MHE. To accomplish this goal, we aim to (i) adapt genome-wide screening assays to search for
novel factors that regulate EXT1 and/or EXT2 expression in human cells, and (ii) validate prioritized hits from
the screens in primary human chondrocytes using commercially available drugs and/or RNAi methods. The
successful completion of these aims will provide new pharmacological targets for enhancing EXT expression
and HS levels in cells and may also uncover previously unknown genes associated with MHE. Importantly, this
project will lead to future detailed hypothesis-driven studies that will bring us closer to finding a cure for this
debilitating disorder."

Dementia with Lewy bodies (LBD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are characterized pathologically by the
presence of Lewy bodies, composed of misfolded alpha synuclein (α-syn) inclusions. These disorders are
progressive, and result in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in multiple motor and non-motor basal
ganglia circuits. There are no known disease altering drugs, hence there is an unmet need for delivering viable
treatments to slow down progression of LBDs. Furthermore, there is a growing body of literature suggesting the
role that lipids play in LBD pathogenesis. We have developed a promising mRNA-based immunomodulatory
approach (ACT), which shows efficacy of reducing α-syn pathology burden in a preclinical model. We also show
that ACT restores the lipidome to normal levels and hence visualizing the inter-brain distribution of lipids along
with key enzymes involved in lipid metabolism would help comprehend their roles and alterations over time in
the aging and diseased brain.
Systems biology approaches provide a holistic examination of interactions between the metabolome, and
environment in an attempt to comprehend pathomechanisms involved in LBDs. Imaging mass spectrometry
(IMS) is a new technology that has the ability to map a wide range of small molecules with high spatial resolution,
and the ability to quantify them, without a priori labeling, and hence can be harnessed to elucidate the role of the
metabolome in driving neurodegeneration. Here we propose to generate a spatial atlas of the lipidome to identify
lipid markers of disease progression in Aim 1, and assess lipid alterations resulting from ACT using MSI in Aim
2."

Barth syndrome (BTHS) is an ultra-rare (<500 individuals identified worldwide), life-threatening genetic
disease that primarily affects males. BTHS patients may develop cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy,
neutropenia, feeding difficulties, growth delay, and/or debilitating fatigue. There is currently no cure for
BTHS. Similar to many other rare diseases, developing treatments is an immense challenge due to
limitations in resources and insufficient commercial interest considering the small number of people
affected. Despite these obstacles, the Barth Syndrome Foundation (BSF)–a patient advocacy group
for those affected by BTHS–has made its mission to save lives through education, advances in
treatments, and finding a cure for the disease. A cornerstone program, for BSF to eventually realize
this mission, is the biennial Scientific and Medical Conference on Barth Syndrome.
Since 2000, BSF has held a biennial conference that provides a unique opportunity to stimulate new
clinical and scientific progress by bringing together physicians, healthcare providers, researchers,
affected individuals, and their families. The 2014, 2016, and 2018 conferences ushered in an era of
specific therapies for BTHS and two clinical trials, TAZPOWER and CARDIOMAN. Virtual symposia
were held in 2020 and 2022, where researchers presented the first proof-of-concept for AAV gene
therapy in BTHS mouse models, extant therapies for cardiomyopathy including heart transplantation,
and promising findings in the elamipretide open label extension data.
The “2024 Scientific and Medical Conference on Barth Syndrome: Benchtop to Treatments,” provides
a unique opportunity to stimulate new clinical and scientific progress. At the 2024 conference,
physicians, healthcare providers, researchers, and the affected community will meet in an intimate and
supportive environment. Aligned with our theme of “Benchtop to Treatments,” a novel focus for our
2024 conference will be on clinical trial readiness, which is critical in developing therapies for BTHS to
achieve the overarching goal of a world where BTHS no longer causes suffering or loss of life."

The serine/threonine Raf Kinases function as downstream modulators of RAS GTPase-driven signaling and are
key drivers of many oncogenic signaling networks. Despite extensive efforts to characterize the molecular
functions of Raf kinases and to develop pharmacological modulators as cancer therapies, many aspects of Raf
kinase regulation and intracellular function are not well understood. Recent work suggests that the interplay of
different Raf isoforms (A/B/C-R Raf) can have a profound effect on downstream signaling and may be a major
determinant in the ability to pharmacologically target cancers that are driven by mutant RAS and Raf. Here, we
propose a systematic biochemical analysis of Raf regulation, intracellular function, and pharmacology.
Leveraging a suite of molecular tools for dissecting the “druggability” of RAF isoforms, we will define pathways
that make Raf kinases sensitive or resistant to specific classes of ATP-competitive inhibitors and co-inhibition
strategies. In addition, by applying a new RNA barcoding methodology that we’ve developed, we will perform
deep mutational scans of the structure, function, and pharmacology of Raf isoforms. Furthermore, we will
systematically analyze how upstream and downstream modulators of Raf kinase signaling affect the activity and
intracellular interactions of Raf kinases. Together, these studies will provide a more complete picture of Raf
kinase regulation, intracellular function, and may facilitate more effective therapeutic targeting of RAS- and Raf-
driven cancers."

The intestinal epithelium possesses one of the highest self-renewing capacities among tissues due to the
presence and functions of active intestinal stem cells (aISCs). Concurrently, aISCs are susceptible to injury due
to various pathological conditions because of their high proliferative capability. Recent studies have shown that
subpopulations of intestinal epithelial cells such as reserve stem cells (e.g., those marked by Bmi1, Hopx1, Lrig1,
mTert), progenitors (Atoh1, Dll1), and several terminally differentiated cell types (enteroendocrine, Paneth,
enterocyte) become activated in the aftermath of injury to replenish the basal crypt compartment, which then
reconstitutes cell populations of the villi. Additionally, recent studies demonstrated that subpopulations of
mesenchymal cells marked by Pdgfra, Gli1, or Cd81 provide essential factors to sustain the renewal of the stem
cell niche. Nonetheless, there needs to be a complete understanding of the mechanisms that regulate
communication between various cell types and their influence on the regenerative capacity of the intestine.
Identifying the mechanisms that coordinate interactions between multiple cell populations (e.g., epithelial cells
and mesenchymal cells) in the intestine during regeneration may aid in identifying targets for therapeutic
interventions.
The Long-Term Goal of this research proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms regulating the activation of
and coordination between intestinal epithelial and stromal cells upon γ radiation-induced injury. Our
exciting preliminary results showed that Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), normally absent under homeostatic conditions,
increases in the intestinal epithelium shortly after irradiation. Furthermore, new preliminary results demonstrate
increased levels of HIF1α and KLF4 in the intestinal epithelium upon injury and their ability to induce Shh
promoter activity by direct binding to its promoter. SHH ligands then induce Gli1 expression in stromal cells and
stimulate their proliferation. In turn, activated stromal cells secrete WNT ligands, promoting the expansion of
Bmi1+ cells to repopulate the intestinal crypts. Inhibition of SHH and WNT signaling, in vitro and in vivo, abrogates
regeneration of the intestinal epithelium post-irradiation. Based on these compelling and exciting findings, our
Central Hypothesis is that precise spatiotemporal communication between intestinal epithelial and
stromal cells is fundamental for regenerating the intestinal epithelium following radiation injury. To test
this hypothesis, we designed three Specific Aims: (SA1) to investigate the mechanism that regulates the
induction of Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling in intestinal epithelial cells upon irradiation; (SA2) to identify and
characterize the stromal cell population(s) promoting intestinal regeneration; and (SA3) to examine the
mechanism underlying the intestinal epithelial cell activation upon stromal stimulation. The proposed studies will
advance our understanding of the mechanisms regulating intestinal epithelial regeneration and will have potential
therapeutic implications in diseases of the gastrointestinal tract."

 In the last two decades, genomic sequencing technologies have made remarkable
advancements in the quality and number of human genomes sequenced. Moreover, the emergence of
long-read sequencing has unveiled a level of genome variation and diversity that is elusive through
conventional short-read methods. Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, with more than 14
million new cases and 8 million deaths each year. It is often characterized by substantial
heterogeneity with respect to the cancer subtype and population group. This heterogeneity manifests
at multiple levels, including genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic and is fundamental to the
understanding of the mechanisms driving cancer phenotypes. Nevertheless, these variations are quite
complex and difficult to recapitulate in short-read studies.
 The goal of my work as the head of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Sequencing
Technology and Analysis Shared Resource (STASR) is to provide superior insight and expertise in
sequencing technologies and long-read methods in particular. Over the last four years, I have actively
engaged in the development of long-read sequencing strategies and collaborated with researchers to
harness this powerful tool to meet their scientific goals. I intend to continue to develop and optimize
sequencing strategies such as single-cell full length RNA methods, ultra-long (>100kb) DNA
sequencing, novel strategies for long read target enrichment, DNA and RNA modification analysis
and, to improve general accessibility to genome sequencing technologies.
 My track record of facilitating genome science at CSHL has proven me to be an essential
resource to the scientific mission of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cancer Center. My ultimate
goal is to facilitate collaborative research by directing work across various core facilities, fostering
interdisciplinary research, and innovating to address fundamental questions in biology and cancer
science.
 The transformative advancements in genome sequencing technologies, including the
breakthrough of long-read sequencing, have shed light on the previously elusive depth of genome
variation and diversity. My commitment to developing and optimizing advanced sequencing strategies,

determination to address fundamental questions in biology and cancer science."

Resistance is still a limitation of immune checkpoint antibodies and MAPK pathway-targeted inhibitors. Drug-
tolerant persister cell populations are thought to contribute to the emergence of resistant tumors. Loss of the
transcription factor, SOX10, and enhanced YAP/TAZ-TEAD signaling are frequently associated with acquired
resistance and are associated with the minimal residual disease invasive transcriptional state. In our analysis of
human patient-derived xenograft single-cell RNA-seq data, we detect elevated levels of canonical TEAD targets,
CTGF and CYR61 in the SOX10-low, invasive cell state. We show that SOX10 loss is sufficient to induce a
TEAD transcriptional program including CYR61 and CTGF. YAP and TAZ are paralogs that share 50% identity,
but SOX10-deficient cells showed a strong dependence on TAZ for CYR61 and CTGF expression. Furthermore,
overexpression of active TAZ was sufficient to mediate tolerance to BRAF inhibitors and MEK inhibitors. We
developed novel covalent inhibitors, OPN-9643 and OPN-9652, designed to target the central palmitate binding
pocket of TEADs. Treatment of SOX10-deficient cells with either OPN-9643 or OPN-9652 reduced CTGF and
CYR61 expression as well as TEAD-dependent luciferase reporter activity. Our studies aim to utilize novel TEAD
inhibitors to target SOX10-deficient drug-tolerant melanoma cells. Through this training at Thomas Jefferson
University, I will learn molecular techniques, bio-informatics, develop critical thinking skills, and learn to
communicate my science. This award would help me to achieve my long-term goal of becoming an independent

10997487,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Zellweger spectrum disorders (ZSDs), which affect 1:50,000 individuals in the U.S., are characterized by
dysfunction in any one of 13 peroxisomal biogenesis proteins (known as peroxins) and result in severe
neurological phenotypes including seizures, developmental delay, and abnormal white matter growth in the brain.
Life expectancy for patients rarely surpasses a few years. The peroxisomal biogenesis factor 11 beta (PEX11b),
which is essential for peroxisomal fission, is among the peroxins mutated in ZSDs. However, the exact
mechanisms by which peroxisomal morphology may contribute to disease pathophysiology remain unclear. This
proposal aims to directly manipulate peroxisomal morphology during neurodevelopment by genetically deleting
PEX11b and characterizing how PEX11b deficiency affects peroxisomal morphology, peroxisome-mediated
metabolic functions, and early human neurogenesis. We aim to approach these questions by using PEX11b
knockout (KO) human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), which I have generated using CRISPR/Cas9.
We will first assess the effects of PEX11b deficiency on peroxisomal morphology using super-resolution
microscopy and rigorous, automated analysis of peroxisomal fission events, and peroxisomal length and volume
from acquired images. To evaluate neurodevelopmental effects of knocking out PEX11b, we will evaluate self-
renewal and multipotent differentiation potential in hiPSC-derived neural progenitor cells, as well as self-renewal
of the neural progenitor pool and cortical layer formation in hiPSC-derived forebrain organoids. To assess the
metabolic consequences of knocking out PEX11b, we will leverage metabolomics and imaging-mass
spectrometry, among other cutting-edge metabolic profiling techniques, to evaluate whether downregulation of
PEX11b alters cellular levels of long-chain, branched-chain, and very-long-chain-fatty acids. Successful
completion of these aims would help establish the contributions of peroxisomal morphology during
neurodevelopment. Additionally, it would help determine whether disruption of peroxisomal dynamics underlies
ZSDs."

Ewing sarcoma is a pediatric bone and soft tissue cancer that results from chromosomal translocation, most
commonly t(11;22)(q24;q12), which fuses the low-complexity domain (LCD) of the RNA-binding protein EWS
(EWS) to the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of Friend leukemia integration 1 transcription factor (FLI1). The
resulting oncogenic fusion protein EWS::FLI1 directly interferes with the native functions of EWS, particularly
those in transcription and DNA repair, resulting in excessive transcription and sensitivity to DNA damaging
agents. EWS::FLI1 prevents BRCA1 re-localization from transcriptional sites to DNA damage, resulting in an
apparent BRCA1-deficient phenotype and homologous recombination deficiency. When DNA damage occurs,
the EWS RNA-binding domain (EWSRBD) mediates the dissociation of PARP-1 from sites of DNA damage sites,
promoting the initiation of DNA repair. EWS::FLI1 severely impairs these interactions, causing PARP-1 buildup
on DNA damage sites and PARP-1 inhibitor sensitivity characteristic of Ewing sarcoma. However, the molecular
mechanisms underlying EWS::FLI1 interaction with EWS and how those interactions disrupt the native functions
of EWS are unknown. Preliminary data has demonstrated how EWSLCD forms self-associative interactions
primarily mediated by tyrosines throughout the domain. These EWSLCD tyrosines also play a central role in Ewing
sarcoma, mediating self-associative and heterotypic interactions key for neoplastic transformation. EWSLCD also
associates with the EWSRBD, driving their co-localization to biomolecular condensates. However, the structural
basis of EWSLCD:EWSRBD is unknown and the role of this interaction in the transcriptional and DNA repair
functions of EWS remains unknown. The overall goal of this project is to elucidate the structural mechanisms
and functional implications of EWS self-association and how they relate to EWS::FLI1-driven oncogenesis. We
will test the hypothesis that EWSLCD directly interacts with EWSRBD and enhances the nucleic acid binding
propensity of EWS, and that the interplay between EWSLCD and EWSRBD are key to the DNA repair and
transcriptional functions of EWS. Enhancing our understanding of the mechanisms underlying EWS::FLI1-driven
oncogenesis will enable the development of more targeted therapeutics to Ewing sarcoma and related pediatric
malignancies."

Venous malformations (VMs) are vascular lesions with abnormally enlarged vessels that are disfiguring, painful,
and have complications such as bleeding and thrombosis. Current therapeutic options are not universally
effective, can require life-long treatment, and fail to produce full lesion regression, indicating that investigation of
novel causative pathways is needed. VM is associated with mutation in the endothelial tyrosine kinase receptor
TIE2, the most common of which is the p.L914F mutation. However, studies into the cellular mechanisms driving
VM pathogenesis are hindered by the lack of an in vivo model of TIE2 mutation. In addition, our lab has recently
shown that c-ABL, an intracellular tyrosine kinase, is activated in endothelial cells (EC) upon ligand stimulation
of TIE2 or with expression of mutant TIE2 p.L914F. Furthermore, we have also observed that ABL inhibition
mutually reduces TIE2 activation by an unknown mechanism. To address these questions, my proposal rests
on a central hypothesis: increased c-ABL signaling downstream of hyperactive mutant TIE2 p.L914F in
endothelial cells promotes formation of venous malformation through feed forward TIE2/c-ABL
signaling. We will address this hypothesis through the following Specific Aims: 1) define the effects of c-ABL on
TIE2 activation and signaling and 2) determine if c-ABL is required for formation of VM lesions in vivo. In this
work, we will define how ABL signaling affects physiological and pathological TIE2 activation in endothelial cells
utilizing in vitro functional assays and both loss of function and gain of function of c-ABL. We will also utilize our
newly developed transgenic mouse model of TIE2 L914F-driven VM to investigate the cellular defects associated
with VM pathogenesis. This model will then be used to investigate the role of c-ABL in VM formation in vivo and
provide preclinical testing of ABL inhibition for the treatment of VM. The information obtained from this project
will elucidate the relationship between TIE2 and c-ABL signaling in physiological and pathological vascular
function and will establish the first genetic mouse model of mutant TIE2-driven VM, which will be essential for
further study of the mechanisms of VM pathogenesis."

Altered ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) function and brain connectivity are implicated in emotional
dysregulation and the emergence of bipolar disorder. However, our understanding of the development of
VLPFC brain networks prior to bipolar disorder onset is limited. In contrast, we have more comprehensive
knowledge of healthy adolescent brain development, specifically the profound influence of peers on
emotionally responsive brain regions and long-term mental health. This F32 research project aims to gather
feasibility and pilot data to support our central hypothesis that during late development (age 14-21), youth with
a family history of bipolar I disorder (high-risk) will exhibit altered maturation of VLPFC function and
connectivity during negative social interactions compared to youth without a family history (low-risk), which will
be closely associated with measures of emotional reactivity and dysregulation. My long-term career objective is
to become an expert in utilizing neuroimaging techniques to assess bipolar disorder risk and develop stress
resilience interventions. During this research project, I aim to enhance my neuroimaging expertise, academic
presence and knowledge in the neurodevelopment of bipolar disorder through this F32 training and hands-on
research. To test our central hypothesis, we will pursue two specific aims. Firstly, we will investigate the
neurodevelopmental maturation patterns in VLPFC activation and connectivity during peer ostracism in high-
risk compared to low-risk youth. Specifically, we will compare group differences in the relationship between
development and VLPFC response and connectivity with emotionally responsive (e.g., subgenual anterior
cingulate) and cognitively oriented brain regions (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) during peer ostracism.
Secondly, we will investigate the relationship between VLPFC function and connectivity during peer ostracism
and emotional reactivity/regulation in both high and low-risk groups. We posit that, for both groups, VLPFC
activity and connectivity with medial prefrontal cortex, insula, striatum, and thalamus will be associated with
cyberball task distress and the ability to regulate negative emotions more generally. Additionally, we predict
that a VLPFC connectivity and other lateral prefrontal brain regions will be associated with greater emotional
resilience only in high-risk individuals, namely, less emotional reactivity and dysregulation. This study will
investigate emotional control brain networks within a developmental framework, utilizing a participant cohort of
180 youth. By studying these networks before the onset of secondary disease effects and employing age
relevant social tasks, we aim to obtain valuable pilot data for publication while refining our hypotheses for
future research and grant submissions. Findings from this study will advance our understanding of the
neuropathophysiological mechanisms preceding bipolar disorder onset, a step toward earlier intervention
during this dynamic period of emotional and social development."
10999217,"Distractibility poses a significant public health concern for our youth, due to the seemingly never-ending
barrage of visual and auditory stimulation in our real-life and digital environments. The influx of texts and social
media alerts, traffic, and near peer discussions can interfere with their ability to sustain on-task attention. This
challenge is further compounded by internal distractions such as mind wandering and ruminations. For youth,
distractibility takes its heaviest toll in academic situations, whether in the classroom or when studying at home.
However, traditional metrics of distractibility, from the clinic or laboratory, tend to be broad based or lack
contextual information limiting their ability to predict real-life performance. We propose to use three innovative,
state-of-the-art approaches to enhance the measurement of distractibility to better capture what youth
experience in learning situations. We will apply a Research Domain of Criteria (RDoC) framework, with the
goal of improving understanding of Attention in the RDoC Cognitive System Domain and how the Distractibility
subfactor manifests in varying degrees across naturalistic learning contexts. We will study distractibility in
neurotypical (NT) adolescents and youth with varying degrees of impairing distractibility, including those with
diagnosable Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Our translational team from UC Davis and Bar
Ilan University will assess distractibility, using different methods, across three naturalistic learning
environments: 1) a Virtual Reality (VR) classroom using real academic tasks, while capturing eye-gaze and
behavioral performance; 2) a Live Real classroom, using mobile EEG to measure neural processing and
observing behavioral manifestations of distraction; and 3) throughout the course of students' real-life
learning activities, both at school and during homework, using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of
attention. As the RDoC framework recommends, we are examining distractibility across multiple units of
analysis including multi-informant (self, parent, teacher) behavioral ratings, self-report live ratings (EMA),
behavioral performance, eye gaze, neural activity and a variety of functional measures related to learning and
executive functioning. The UC Davis team will study adolescents recruited to represent a dimension of
attentional functioning from NT through ADHD. The Bar Ilan research team is embedded in a high school and
will recruit “natural cohorts” of typical high-school students (9th grade), representative of the general population.
We will assess how our measures predict real-life functioning and distinct attentional profiles (subgroups) of
attentional challenges using latent profile analyses within these heterogeneous samples. This innovative,
translational and cross-cultural collaboration will greatly advance our understanding and measurement of
distractibility in ecologically-relevant circumstances. Results will inform the development of measures for the
clinic and laboratory and precision interventions to mitigate distractibility's adverse effects on youth's everyday
functioning, bridging the translational gap between research, clinical practice, and educational activities."
10999175,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We present an interdisciplinary target discovery and T-cell receptor (TCR) therapy development program
focused on platinum-resistant high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), a highly lethal disease with no
effective long-term treatments or targeted therapies. Nearly all patients diagnosed with HGSOC will relapse after
initial treatment. Disease recurrence within 6 months of platinum treatment is categorized as platinum-resistant
HGSOC, which is highly fatal. Our strategy to develop TCR-based therapies for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer
relies on unmasking the hidden diversity of cancer proteomes produced by RNA dysregulation and mRNA
isoform variation. RNA dysregulation in cancer cells can produce new epitopes through the generation of novel
mRNA and protein isoforms with increased cancer specificity. To identify sufficiently cancer-specific peptide
targets for immunotherapy development, our proposed strategy expands beyond target discovery from somatic
mutations alone. In particular, long-read RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a powerful approach for isoform analysis
and tumor antigen discovery. We propose to exploit mRNA isoform variation as a source of shared tumor
antigens for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. We will first define the landscape of full-length mRNA isoforms in
platinum-resistant ovarian cancer by generating and analyzing long-read nanopore RNA-seq datasets across a
broad cohort of patients with this disease. We will couple this analysis with a big data examination of long- and
short-read transcriptome profiles in a large panel of tumor and normal tissues to assess cancer specificity.
Second, we will directly assay the peptides presented to the immune system by immunopeptidomics, and
examine antigen heterogeneity by single-cell long-read nanopore RNA-seq. Integrating these multiple forms of -
omics analyses with state-of-the-art computational epitope predictions, we will create a highly privileged set of
potential TCR targets. Finally, we will utilize a novel in vitro human artificial thymic organoid (ATO) culture-based
TCR discovery platform to rapidly create and select reactive TCRs from T cells generated through directed
differentiation of pluripotent stem cells. Antigen-specific TCRs will be preclinically evaluated as therapeutically
relevant reagents in vitro and by adoptive TCR-T cell therapy in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of
platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary team of experts at UCLA and the
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, with expertise in ovarian cancer biology and treatment (Memarzadeh), RNA
genomics and computational immuno-oncology (Xing), tumor biology and immunology (Memarzadeh, Seet,
Witte), and T-cell developmental biology (Seet). Our research seeks to discover a new class of antigens and
their cognate TCRs for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and establish their initial efficacy in preclinical models."

 The advancement in sequencing technology has enabled the practice of clinical diagnostic sequencing,
however, the bottle neck remains to be the correct interpretation of millions of variants identified. Despite of the
recent advances in artificial intelligence assisted variant interpretation, this is a particularly prominent problem
when the pathogenicity is associated with gain-of-function missense mutations. The overall objective of this
application is to develop a high throughput variant interpretation approach for MYH7, which will be broadly
applicable to other cardiomyopathy and genetic diseases. The central hypothesis is that MYH7 variants will lead
to gene expression profile changes, which will serve as a sensitive marker to predicting pathogenicity. In this
proposal, we will test the central hypothesis with three specific aims: 1) Develop an integrase-based system for
high throughput variant molecular phenotyping in induced pluripotent stem cell differentiated cardiomyocytes
(iPSC-CM) using single cell RNAseq and contrastive machine learning algorithms; 2) Functional validation in
iPSC-CM using cell size and contractility; 3) Detailed myofilament structure/function studies of the selected
variants for in-depth understanding of genotype-phenotype relationship. The research proposed in this
application is innovative because it takes advantage of single cell sequencing data for robust molecular
phenotyping, it will develop novel machine learning variant interpretation tools specific for structure proteins like
MYH7, and it will generate unprecedented functional experimental data of MYH7 variants in iPSC-CM, which not
only is informative in variants interpretation, but also provides amino acid level functional data on myosin that
can inform our understanding of sarcomere biology. The proposed research is significant because it will develop
a platform that enables high-throughput functional assessment of all possible variants of MYH7, which could
ultimately help to solve all current variant of unknown significance and future ones to be identified in MYH7. This
strategy is readily adaptable to all other inherited cardiomyopathies and other genetic diseases."
10998882,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) caused an estimated 1.6 million deaths in 2021. The emergence of drug-
resistant strains has exacerbated the epidemic, often rendering existing tuberculosis (TB) therapies inadequate
and revealing the dire need for new agents with unique mechanisms of action to combat the epidemic. Towards
this end, we have identified a new series of nitro-containing 1,2,4-triazole compounds that are potent inhibitors
of Mtb. Our preliminary data show that the nitro 1,2,4-triazoles retain activity in Mtb strains that are resistant to
the frontline antibiotics isoniazid and rifampicin, as well as moxifloxacin. In addition, we provide data that argues
against the nitro 1,2,4-triazoles inhibiting QcrB and MmpL3, two proteins commonly targeted by compounds
identified in phenotypic screens in Mtb. Thus, it is possible that the nitro 1,2,4-triazole series represents a new
mechanism of action (MOA) for inhibition of Mtb. To begin to investigate how the nitro-1,2,4-triazoles inhibit Mtb,
we selected for resistant mutants and identified resistant isolates with mutations in genes required for coenzyme
F420 biosynthesis and the nitroreductase Ddn. These mutants are also resistant to pretomanid, a prodrug that
requires activation of its aromatic nitro group by F420-dependent-Ddn activity in order to exert anti-Mtb activity.
We predicted that our nitro 1,2,4-triazoles are similarly activated by Ddn. Therefore, in an effort to circumvent
the need for activation, we performed structure activity relationship (SAR) analyses and discovered that
replacement of the nitro groups in the phenyl ring on the 1,2,4-triazole core with chloro retained activity against
WT Mtb and avoided loss of activity in F420 and Ddn mutants. Thus, the chloro-containing 1,2,4-triazoles
circumvent the predominant resistance mechanism against aromatic nitro-containing compounds. We also
examined core modifications that would retain anti-Mtb activity and discovered that the 1,2,4-triazole core can
be replaced with a chiral pyrrolidine core and retain the same activity. This led us to hypothesize that the core is
a “spacer” linking the other parts of the molecule. Since the core structure defines the compound class, our SAR
method has now resulted in a second new class anti-Mtb agents that will act as a bioisostere with similar steric
volume and retained hydrogen-bond donor/acceptor atoms as the 1,2,4-triazole series. The increased sp3
character of the pyrrolidine scaffolds could be advantageous over the 1,2,4-triazole scaffold in terms of a more
diverse chemical space that has been shown to translate to enhanced clinical success. Our objectives are to
demonstrate preclinical proof-of-concept for the 1,2,4-triazole and pyrrolidine compounds to combat Mtb infection
and optimize lead compounds for pharmacologic properties required for translation to a therapeutic. Based on
our preliminary data, we hypothesize that the 1,2,4-triazole and pyrrolidine compounds operate through a unique
MOA as compared to other antibiotics and, therefore, dissecting their mode of inhibition will also reveal new
biological insight into Mtb physiology and pathogenesis."
10998883,"TITLE: Combined Imaging and RNA Analyses to Develop Cervical Cancer Biomarkers
ABSTRACT
Despite significant advances in disease prevention and screening, cervical cancer continues to be an important
worldwide public health problem. Treating cervical cancer patients with personalized strategies can potentially
improve the chance of survival. Predicting early in treatment whether a tumor is likely to be responsive is one of
the most challenging yet important tasks for stratifying cervical cancer patients and supporting personalized
treatment strategies to improve cancer patient care.
Various unimodal data, including ribonucleic acids (RNAs), radiologic and histologic imaging, and
clinicopathologic data, have been employed for predicting cervical cancer treatment response and patient
outcome. Each type of unimodal data analyzes tumor phenotypes from a different point of view and provides
valuable while limited prognostic information. We and others have shown that RNAs are promising biomarkers
and play critical regulatory roles in cervical cancer. Radiologic imaging biomarkers have shown promise in
stratifying patients with favorable and unfavorable prognosis for multiple tumor sites. Their non-invasive
characteristics also allow for convenient and longitudinal monitoring of tumor progression and heterogeneous
response during the treatment course. Moreover, histologic images provide key information about microscopic
structure of cells and tissues of organisms. Recent reports and our preliminary studies have shown that
histologic imaging biomarkers, can aid in clinical decision-making by identifying metastases, subtyping and
grading tumors, and predicting clinical outcomes. Clinicopathologic biomarkers show prognostic value
through retrospective studies. Still, many cervical cancer patients have tumor recurrence despite favorable
prognosis by these biomarkers individually.
The major goal of this study is to develop a comprehensive and robust computational model for prediction of
cervical cancer treatment response and outcomes. We will integrate our recently developed advanced learning-
based techniques to build prognostic models using about 600 cervical patient cases collected from two
institutions. The prognostic model will form a solid basis for individualized care of cervical cancer patients.
Moreover, our work is expected to discover the correlations among multimodal data, leading to dynamic patient
stratification to support adaptive treatment strategies in the future."
10998242,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the biliary epithelium characterized
by periductal fibrosis, a heightened risk for cholangiocarcinoma, and frequent comorbidity with inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD). The periductal fibrosis observed in PSC narrows the lumen of affected bile ducts and
causes extrahepatic cholestasis, which mediates further liver injury. PSC patients typically develop end-stage
liver disease within 10-20 years of diagnosis, making PSC a clinically significant cause of liver transplant in the
United States. There are currently no disease modifying drugs for PSC, underscoring the unmet need for novel
research that characterizes the pathologic mechanisms that drive periductal fibrosis in PSC patients.
Aim 1 seeks to dissect the cellular heterogeneity of the periductal niche and characterize cell subpopulations
mediating periductal fibrosis in PSC patients using single-cell multiomics. In this aim, the 10X Genomics Next
GEM single-cell RNA-sequencing platform will be used to perform integrative analysis of gene expression and
chromatin availability in single cells. The gene expression signatures of PSC patient tissue and PBMCs will be
compared to patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and non-cirrhotic controls.
Aim 2 seeks to map the spatial organization of cell subpopulations within PSC periductal lesions and reveal
cellular interactions within intact tissue. In this aim, the 10X Genomics Xenium in situ Gene Expression
Analyzer will be employed to measure the expression of 400 genes in 10µm thick, 12mm x 22mm tissue
sections produced from explanted liver tissue. This work will shed new light on the cellular landscape that
drives periductal fibrosis, biliary-type cirrhosis, which is often present in patients with advanced PSC, and
MASH cirrhosis, which is included as a control.
Aim 3 seeks to characterize the effects of a leaky biliary epithelium on macrophage function and collagen
production in the periductal niche using an in vitro model. Bile-stimulated macrophages will be characterized at
the RNA and protein level and differences in the activating potential of PSC patient bile versus control bile will
be assessed. Macrophage-fibroblast co-cultures will also be treated with bile and collagen production will be
measured using the Sircol assay. This work utilizes patient-derived bile samples and an in vitro myeloid-
stromal co-culture model to resolve luminal, myeloid, and stromal contributions to periductal fibrosis.
Mount Sinai Hospital cares for one of the largest and most diverse PSC patient populations in the United
States, and the Icahn School of Medicine home to pioneers in the field of hepatic fibrosis research. The training
plan for this fellowship takes full advantage of the academic environment at Mount Sinai, and the research
strategy combines a single-cell approach with the development of a novel cell culture model to assess cellular
drivers of periductal fibrosis. This work will characterize the cellular landscape of periductal fibrosis at a single-
cell resolution and promote the development of novel diagnostics and therapeutics for PSC patient care."

Background: People with HIV (PWH) are at increased risk of developing coronary artery disease (CAD) as
compared to people without HIV (PWOH). The pathophysiology of CAD amongst PWH is believed to be due to
an accelerated inflammatory process, resulting in formation of non-calcified, vulnerable plaques that are often
not detected by standardized diagnostic methods. Pericoronary adipose tissue (PCAT) may serve as a feasible
alternative imaging technique for early detection of coronary inflammation among PWH in Uganda, but has not
been evaluated in the region. Candidate: The goal of the proposed K43 Emerging Global Leader (K43) Award
is to support Dr. Prossy BIbangambah, a clinician scientist and faculty radiologist at Mbarara University of
Science and Technology, to become an independent clinician-scientist with expertise in development and
evaluation of innovative imaging techniques to elucidate the mechanisms of HIV-related cardiovascular
disease (CVD) in sub-Saharan Africa. To achieve this, she will gain additional training in: 1) collection and
analysis of cardiovascular image modalities for use in clinical research, 2) radiomics methods, including feature
selection and machine learning to apply state-of-the-art technology to detect clinical abnormalities, and 3)
statistical methods for diagnostic evaluation and risk prediction. This K43 project will help her achieve her long-
term career goals through provision of didactic training in these key areas, mentorship from a team of world
experts and practical research experience through the completion of her scientific aims. Research: Dr.
Bibangambah will determine the relationship between PCAT, inflammation, and subclinical CAD in PWH by
leveraging data and coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) images from two completed NIH-
funded study cohorts through completion of the following aims: Aim 1: performing CCTA-based segmentation
of PCAT and comparing the density between PWH and PWOH; Aim 2: using segmented images from Aim 1 to
extract PCAT radiomics features and compare the difference in PCAT radiomics signatures between PWH and
PWOH; and Aim 3: determining whether PCAT densities from Aim 1 or the radiomics signatures from Aim 2
improve the performance of cardiovascular risk prediction. Innovation: This study will be among the first to
evaluate a novel tissue biomarker (PCAT) using CCTA-images and its relationship with inflammation and CAD
in PWH in sub-Saharan Africa. Deliverables and future directions: With mentored training and skills gained
from these scientific aims, Dr. Bibangambah will publish six manuscripts and be well-positioned to submit an
NIH R01 proposal to evaluate the novel radiomics models/signature in predicting major adverse cardiovascular
events (MACE) among people with and without HIV in Uganda."
10999333,"Project Summary
Hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction are caused by death of sensory hair cells that in mammals fail to
regenerate. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop techniques for regenerating hair cells in humans.
Promising progress has been made but the regenerated hair cells do not fully mature. It is therefore essential
that we gain a detailed understanding of the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) regulating hair cell
differentiation. In mice several transcription factors (TFs) regulate hair cell subtypes, such as TBX2 that
specifies inner ear hair cells (IHCs) and INSM1 and IKZF2 that are important for outer hair cell (OHC) fate
determination. How these TFs are regulated, how they interact with each other and what their direct targets are
is unknown. Also, as these factors are not sufficient to completely convert hair cell fates, additional co-factors
must exist. Zebrafish possess hair cells not only in their ears but also in the skin as part of the sensory lateral
line (LL) system. We and others have developed the zebrafish LL into a powerful model system to interrogate
the molecular mechanisms underlying hair cell regeneration. Our preliminary scRNA-Seq and TF motif
analyses show that the GRNs that regulate zebrafish lateral line versus ear hair cell identities share genes with
the mouse GRN that regulates IHCs versa OHCs, such as Insm1, Ikzf2 and Tbx2. In addition, we identified
prdm1a as a new regulatory factor controlling hair cell differentiation. Strikingly, loss of prdm1a leads to a
conversion of LL hair cells into ear hair cells via the activation of tbx2. Prdm1 is also expressed in mouse
progenitor cells but is turned off in hair cells. We hypothesize that the genes involved in the lineage decisions
that induce cells to differentiate from a common hair cell progenitor into organ-specific hair cell types are
regulated by similar core GRNs in zebrafish and mammals. Here we are proposing to characterize the GRNs
consisting of insm1a/b, ikzf2, prdm1a and tbx2a/b underlying hair cell subtype decisions in the lateral line and
ear, identify additional genes in the GRNs and functionally test key genes and enhancers. Importantly, building
cell type-specific GRNs during the regeneration time course will identify the injury-responsive upstream
regulators of the hair cell type-specifying genes. We will integrate single cell gene expression and chromatin
accessibility from the same cells at several regeneration time points to predict TF binding motifs in cis-
regulatory elements, linking TFs to enhancers and target genes. We will then computationally infer gene
regulatory networks and key TFs that control hair cell lineage commitment events in the LL and ear. TFs
predicted to play key roles will be functionally tested. In summary, our proposed experiments will construct
GRNs of hair cell subtype differentiation in the zebrafish in a regenerative context, which will yield candidate
factors essential for directing the differentiation of the correct hair cell types in various mouse sensory epithelia
during regeneration and organoid production. In addition, the comparison of the GRNs between the LL and the
ear will provide insights into how changes in regulatory elements drive the evolution of different hair cell types."
10998222,"Metastatic prostate cancer remains incurable and inevitably progresses to lethal disease despite expanding treatment options. Standard of care includes therapies targeting the androgen receptor (AR) pathway, a key regulator of prostate lineage and survival. Despite a decade of approvals of more potent AR Signaling Inhibitors (ARSI), nearly all patients with metastatic prostate cancer develop recurrence due to the emergence of castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Even with recent advances, the mechanisms driving metastatic progression and the diverse molecular underpinnings of ARSI resistance remain to be fully elucidated, thereby complicating the development of therapies to overcome resistance. Within the tumor microenvironment (TME), cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF) are phenotypically and functionally heterogenous and have varying roles in tumor progression and therapeutic resistance, however, many of these mechanisms remain elusive. We and others have revealed that Asporin (ASPN)+ CAF are associated with worse oncological outcomes including metastasis, and we have further demonstrated that they are enriched in therapy resistant metastases. As a secreted protein, ASPN has been shown to communicate throughout the TME to orchestrate cancer cell migration and metastatic development. Our new data indicate that ASPN also protects prostate cancer cells from enzalutamide, a second-generation ARSI. Preliminary data support that ASPN in the TME regulates metastasis and therapy resistance through the activation of HER2/3, a targetable pathway with reported involvement in migration, metastasis, and ARSI resistance. Consistent with this, preliminary analyses show that ASPN+ CAF co-localize with HER2 and HER3 expression in mCRPC. Preliminary mechanistic data indicate that ASPN binds to HER3 and induces the activation of HER2/3 and downstream pathways including MAPK, PI3K, and calcium signaling. Our preliminary findings highlight the importance of ASPN-HER2/3 mediated release of intracellular calcium stores in both HER2/3 signal amplification and calcium microdomain oscillations which are critical for migration. Collectively, our data strongly support our central hypothesis that ASPN+ CAF potentiate prostate cancer migration, metastasis, and ARSI resistance by activating HER2/3 signaling in adjacent prostate cancer cells. Our goals are to 1) Define the molecular mechanisms of ASPN-induced HER2/3 activation, 2) Determine mechanisms of ASPN-HER2/3 regulated calcium oscillations in cellular migration, and 3) Elucidate the functional role of ASPN-HER2/3 in prostate cancer metastasis and therapy resistance. We expect that the outcomes from the proposed studies will provide 1) critical information on a novel mechanism of HER2/3 activation by ASPN in the TME and 2) opportunities for repurposing HER2/3 directed therapies for innovative therapeutic approaches in prostate cancer. By using cutting edge technologies, we will expand current paradigms pertaining to the role of CAF in cancer metastasis and therapy resistance. Ultimately, these studies have potential to impact cancer therapeutics and patient outcomes."

Chronic kidney diseases, of which glomerular diseases form the most significant component, are quite
common and estimated to affect from 5 to 11% of the population. Specific treatment options for various
forms of chronic kidney disease in general are extremely limited, in part due to the poor understanding of
the pathogenesis of glomerular diseases. What has been apparent since the advent of electron
microscopic visualization of the glomerular filtration barrier is that loss of typical podocyte foot process
architecture, termed podocyte foot process effacement, is a hallmark of proteinuric glomerular diseases.
The overall goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms that ensure podocyte
homeostasis, the maintenance of normal podocyte architecture and adhesion to the glomerular
basement membrane, and the pathogenic mechanisms that promote podocyte foot process effacement
and the subsequent detachment. By better understanding these mechanisms, targeted therapies to
intervene in these pathways can be designed to improve the outcomes of patients either already living
with or at risk of glomerular disease. Proof of concept therapeutic approaches are proposed in this
project.
The overall focus of this application involves several mechanistic aspects of podocyte cytoskeletal
dynamics in relation to slit diaphragm stability, foot process shape, and adhesion to the underlying GBM
through integrins. Our hypothesis is that podocyte foot process adhesion dynamics can be
controlled by modulating tensional homeostasis in cytoskeletal networks of both contractile and
non-contractile actin cables that bind integrins and slit diaphragms. The Specific Aims are focused
on the functions of synaptopodin (Aim 1), CD2-associated protein (CD2AP; Aim 2), and integrin-based
podocyte adhesion in health and disease states (Aim 3). We will investigate how these three aspects of
podocyte biology cooperate and interact with each other to ensure podocyte homeostasis under the
constant stress of filtration. We will use several novel, innovative approaches to carry out the Aims and
will use our mouse models of nephrotic syndrome and Alport syndrome as highly relevant human
disease models. The results of the proposed experiments, which also have biochemical,
mechanobiological, state of the art imaging, and primary podocyte cell culture components, will lead to
an improved understanding of diverse aspects of podocyte biology and reveal clear pathways towards
the development of new therapies for patients."
10999512,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) is common and distressing among cancer survivors. An
understudied area is the impact of targeted therapies, a new generation of cancer therapy. Tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs) are among the first, most prolific, and most successful classes of targeted therapy. TKIs are
rapidly expanding, with over 40 FDA-approved TKIs for cancer. We propose to study the impact of targeted
therapy on CRCI among patients about to start TKI for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL). These are the ideal models to study the impact of targeted therapy on CRCI because TKI is
usually first-line therapy for patients with CML and CLL, patients with hematologic cancers have been
understudied in CRCI research, our preliminary data suggests that CRCI is a significant problem for patients with
CML and CLL, and these patients also have excellent survival.
We propose the first large-scale prospective study to examine the impact of TKIs on CRCI, including potential
risk factors and mechanisms. We note three innovative contributions to the field of CRCI. First, we will examine
both subjective and objective CRCI using both neuropsychological measures (CANTAB) used in our prior
nationwide studies and ecological momentary assessment (EMA). EMA improves the reliability and sensitivity of
objective CRCI, and EMA better assesses subjective cognitive lapses. Second, cancer and cancer treatment
promote accelerations in biological aging, which is associated with cognitive impairments. We will evaluate
whether accelerated epigenetic aging is related to variability in CRCI. Third, we propose to identify modifiable
behavioral and modifiable risk factors. This work will inform development of future interventions to prevent or
reduce CRCI.
We will conduct the first study of subjective and objective CRCI among TKIs recipients for CML and patients with
CLL. We will recruit 200 patients about to begin TKIs for CML or CML and 200 controls matched on age, sex,
and education with no history of cancer. Participants will be recruited in partnership with the University of
Rochester Cancer Center NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research Base and 30
nationwide affiliates treating a large population of CML/CLL patients on TKIs per year. Assessments will occur
prior to starting TKIs and 6 and 12 months later and will include a CANTAB battery, cognitive EMA via
smartphone, patient-reported outcomes, wrist-worn actigraphy to assess sleep and circadian function, and a
saliva sample. We aim to characterize differences in objective and subjective cancer-related cognitive
impairment (CRCI) at pre-treatment and longitudinally among patients receiving TKIs for CML and CLL. We will
also identify risk factors for CRCI before and during TKI therapy. Lastly, we will identify biobehavioral
mechanisms underlying the effect of TKIs on CRCI."
11001075,"Approximately 30% of children will experience an anxiety disorder, making anxiety the most common
mental health problem among children in the United States. However, few children receive treatment and
even our most effective anxiety treatments leave up to half of children in need of additional intervention.
Despite the well-established role of parent anxiety in transmitting and maintaining child anxiety, the lack of
data on specific parent mechanisms underlying the intergenerational transmission of anxiety is a critical
barrier to informing novel targets of personalized treatments. Consistent with NIMH’s Strategic Plan,
Objective 2.2 to understand risk factors and behavioral indicators of mental illness across the lifespan and
to identify novel intervention targets based on knowledge of psychological mechanisms, the current
proposal focuses on interpretation bias, the tendency to perceive threat in ambiguous situations. The
overall objective of this project is to empirically test a theoretical model of the intergenerational
transmission of anxiety focused on parent interpretation bias as a root cause. Our specific aims are to test
theorized effects of parent interpretation bias on (1) parent behavior and (2) child interpretation bias and
(3) evaluate potential moderators to refine theories of intergenerational transmission of anxiety and inform
future personalized interventions. Our central hypothesis is that parent interpretation bias influences child
interpretation bias through its effects on maladaptive, anxiety-promoting parenting behaviors, such as
accommodation and modeling of avoidant coping. To test this hypothesis, we will randomize 300 parents
of children ages 7-12 to complete four weeks of a smartphone delivered interpretation bias manipulation
vs. a self-assessment smartphone app condition. The interpretation bias intervention teaches parents to
interpret ambiguous situations in a non-threatening manner via quick, repeated practice and corrective
feedback. Before and after completing their randomly assigned condition, parent-child dyads will complete
self-report and behavioral tasks designed to elicit anxiety-promoting behaviors from parents depending
upon their interpretation of the ambiguous situation (speech and puzzle tasks). Parents will also complete
Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) of parenting behaviors to capture the time course of effects.
Finally, we will examine downstream effects of the interpretation manipulation on child interpretation bias
at pre- and post- visits. We will test moderators (e.g., parent anxiety and gender) to refine theories of
intergenerational transmission of anxiety and inform future personalized interventions. The long-term goal
of this work is to inform personalized, mechanism-focused interventions to improve mental health
outcomes for anxious children and their parents. Future studies will translate knowledge gained from this
project into a scalable treatment that can be implemented entirely remotely via smartphone thereby
increasing access to care."
11000147,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 A fundamental challenge in our rapidly aging society is how to extend healthspan, or maintain robust fitness
without major diseases. The circadian clock, our intrinsic timer, is a pivotal cellular mechanism to promote health
and healthy aging, as both loss- and gain-of-function studies have provided strong experimental evidence for a
causative role of circadian rhythms in aging. This is important because in humans, environmental circadian
disruptions associated with modern 24/7 lifestyles also aggravate disease risk and age-related decline. Despite
growing functional insights, a significant gap in knowledge remains regarding cellular mechanisms and
interventional strategies that impinge on circadian timing to promote healthy aging. The ROR (Retinoid acid
receptor-related Orphan Receptor) subfamily of nuclear receptors are key clock components, functioning to
sustain oscillatory robustness and phase which is known to alter with age. We previously identified an agonist of
RORs called Nobiletin (NOB) and demonstrated a strong efficacy of NOB to improve physiological fitness in
disease models and aged mice. Extending the pharmacological gain-of-function studies, we recently generated
muscle-specific double knockout of Rora and Rorc in mice (Ror mDKO), and found that adult and aged Ror
mDKO mice showed impaired skeletal muscle function and mitochondrial dysfunction in a circadian time-
dependent manner. Importantly, circadian transcriptomic analysis showed significantly altered circadian
expression (level, amplitude and phase) of OXPHOS genes. We hypothesize that RORs control mitochondrial
respiration and skeletal muscle function via circadian transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms, and play a
modifiable role in lifestyle interventions to enhance healthy aging. In Aim 1, we will comprehensively investigate
the role of RORs in age- and circadian time-dependent changes in mitochondrial activity and homeostasis in
skeletal muscle. In Aim 2, we will determine circadian transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms by RORs in
skeletal muscle, especially in the concerted regulation of OXPHOS gene expression. In Aim 3, combining timed
exercise and NOB treatment, we will determine the requisite role of RORs in circadian interventions to prolong
healthspan and lifespan. Together, the proposed studies will provide key mechanistic insights into circadian
regulation of skeletal muscle mitochondria, and pinpoint RORs as an actionable target for lifestyle interventions
to enhance healthy aging. The innovations include new insights into the function and mechanisms of RORs in
skeletal muscle aging, a novel tissue-specific double KO mouse line and circadian epigenetic/3D genome
studies, and versatile circadian interventions. We have assembled an excellent investigator team with
complementary expertise and demonstrated track records in aging, circadian rhythms, mitochondrial
metabolism, genetic/epigenetic regulation, and interventions. Given the prevalent lifestyle-related circadian
perturbations and associated disease risks in our society, the proposed study may have broad basic and
translational impact, eventually leading to improved quality of life in the elderly."

The burden of HIV among people who use drugs (PWUD) is high in Tanzania. No current national data are
available in Tanzania on the burden of drug use and HIV among all PWUD. A study conducted in 2017 in Dar
es Salaam, a business capital of Tanzania, indicated HIV prevalence of 8.7% among a sample of people who
inject drugs (PWID) which is roughly twice as high as HIV prevalence in the general population (4.7%). One of
the challenges of the efforts to control HIV among PWUD globally including Tanzania is HIV and drug use
stigma.
 PWUD face different kinds of HIV and drug use stigma globally and in Tanzania. These stigmas have
negative physical and mental health outcomes for PWUD and are a barrier to general health care and HIV
prevention, care and treatment. There is growing recognition of the need to address HIV and drug use stigma
faced by PWUD--yet research and interventions to do so are limited. Interventions to address HIV and drug
use stigma from health care workers towards patients exist but not with families. A family is critical to support
PWUD to enter and remain in HIV and drug prevention and treatment pathways. Also reducing family stigma is
crucial to improve quality of life of patients. In spite of this, globally there are no interventions to address HIV
and drug use stigma from family members towards PWUD. To address this gap, I propose to adapt existing
evidence-based health facility HIV and drug use stigma reduction interventions and create a stigma-reduction
intervention for family members of PWUD that will address both HIV and drug use stigma coming from family
members going towards PWUD. Therefore, the specific aims of this study are to:
 1. Adapt existing health facility HIV and drug use stigma reduction interventions to address HIV
and drug use stigma among family members of PWUD in Tanzania.
 2. Assess the acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness, adoption, and fidelity of the adapted
family HIV and drug use stigma reduction intervention among family members of PWUD in Tanzania.
 3. Determine psychometric properties of developed HIV and drug use stigma measures.
Methods: We will achieve Specific Aim 1 through a step-wise adaptation process starting with the formative
assessment. We will conduct in-depth interviews with 36 PWUD who are about to start methadone treatment
and those who are on MAT in the first six month and 36 family members of PWUD to determine the
relationships, types and manifestations of HIV and drug use stigma that PWUD face from family members to
inform what and how to adapt the intervention and implementation. Principal Investigator (PI) and stigma
experts will use the results of the formative assessment to create draft 1 curriculum of the intervention. PWUD,
their family members, key stakeholders and topical experts will be involved to review draft 1. Stigma experts
and the PI will integrate feedback to create draft 2 of the intervention curriculum. We will achieve Specific Aim
2 by implementing the intervention among 151 family members of PWUD using draft 2 of the intervention
curriculum. After the implementation, we will measure the implementation outcomes namely acceptability,
feasibility, appropriateness, adoption, and fidelity using mixed methods. One focus group discussion (FGD) will
be done from each of the ten groups of family members that received the intervention. All Participants will be
surveys and 6-8 participants selected randomly for FGDs. To address Specific Aim 3, we will use secondary
data available from our previous grant (1R21TW011786) to determine the psychometric properties (validity and
reliability) of experienced, anticipated, perceived, and internalized HIV and drug use stigma measures. We will
conduct exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, and known-group validity analyses."
10979412,"ABSTRACT: Lymphedema affects approximately 200 million patients globally, and it is characterized by the
accumulation of lymph fluid in soft tissues due to obstructions in the lymphatic system. In Western countries, it
most commonly occurs as a direct outcome of the cancer treatment itself, most frequently in survivors of breast
and gynecological cancers. Lymphedema is a chronic and progressive disease that has no cure. Current
treatment approaches mainly address the symptoms of tissue swelling and discomfort by physiotherapy and
compression. We recently developed an aligned-braided nanofibrillar collagen conduit that is implanted to bridge
the region of lymphatic obstruction as a new surgical treatment strategy. Our preliminary preclinical and clinical
studies demonstrate that implantation of the conduit reduces symptoms associated with lymphedema. We
propose to advance translational research and application of this novel resorbable conduit to deliver a much-
needed surgical preventative treatment for lymphedema. Based on technology developed by Fibralign Corp. and
a previous version of the conduit that showed promising preclinical and clinical results in lymphedema treatment,
the objective is to optimize the structural and mechanical properties of the conduit for targeting lymphedema
prevention in well-established mouse and rat lymphedema models. Accordingly, in Specific Aim 1, we
hypothesize that aligned nanofibrillar conduits with optimally engineered structural and mechanical properties
will promote capillary flow and lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) function. We will determine the optimal properties
(stiffness, nanofibril diameter, degradation rate, and capillarity) of the conduit that maximize LEC phenotype and
lymphatic sprouting. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that optimally engineered aligned nanofibrillar
conduits will accelerate lymphatic regeneration and normalize lymphatic flow in a murine tail model of secondary
lymphedema. We will first test the therapeutic efficacy in a mouse model of lymphedema, in which conduit
formulations will be implanted into the mouse tail immediately after induction of lymphedema. Output measures
will consist of tail volume and lymph drainage pattern, based on indocyanine green (ICG) imaging. ICG imaging
will enable non-invasive tracking of perfusion over time to track for the ability of the conduits to promote
lymphangiogenesis. The conduit whose properties maximize lymphatic regeneration and lymph drainage will
undergo further analysis in a more clinically relevant rat model of lymphedema induced by lymph node resection
and irradiation in Aim 3. Here, conduits will be implanted immediately after lymphedema induction surgery as a
preventative intervention. Treatment groups will consist of optimally engineered conduit compared to the no
treatment control group or to reference conduit formulations. Over 3 months, we will quantify edema
accumulation by micro computed tomography, lymph drainage pattern by ICG imaging, and lymphatic
regeneration will be confirmed by histological quantification of lymphatic density. Through this industry-academia
partnership, we anticipate these studies will advance the surgical prevention of lymphedema."

Current post-stroke rehabilitation treatments assist only ~50% of patients, resulting in an urgent need to develop
new therapies for the millions of individuals who suffer from chronic motor deficits. A recently-completed Phase
I clinical trial led by our team (EDEN), showed promising results for a new deep brain stimulation (DBS)
rehabilitation treatment, with some heterogeneity in recovery outcomes across patients. To answer why some
patients respond to the treatment while others don’t, a better mechanistic understanding of how DBS contributes
to post-stroke rehabilitation is essential. Our central hypothesis is that patient-specific customization of DBS
parameters such as amplitude, frequency and duration are required to address unique differences in brain
conditions and to maximize the potential of this new treatment. The project’s goals are to study how
reorganization of the perilesional brain tissue after injury is promoted by DBS, and to develop a subject-specific
approach for tuning the DBS parameters to enhance recovery. For achieving our goals, we will use a rat model
of ischemia, where we can systematically vary the stroke injury parameters using the endothelin-1
vasoconstriction model and visualize the injury and the brain functional activity before and during recovery across
most of the dorsal cortex using two-photon microscopy and calcium imaging. Our long-term goal is to translate
similar interventions to patients, based on the lessons from rats. The Project rationale: This project 1) provides
a comprehensive platform for rigorous study of basic mechanisms of brain reorganization and generation of new
functional properties following ischemic injury in a preclinical animal model, 2) provides animal-specific
information on reorganization of cortical circuits during post-stroke recovery to address heterogeneity across
animals, and 3) enables direct comparison across different rehabilitation approaches. Aim 1 will determine the
contribution of different treatments to circuit reorganization and motor recovery after injury and Aim 2 will
demonstrate multi-facet optimization of subject-specific DBS parameters to enhance brain reorganization and
motor rehabilitation in middle-aged male and female rats for different injury types. Impact: The proposed project
will provide us with mechanistic understanding on the reorganization process of cortical neurons following an
ischemic stroke, and how efficient DBS treatment may promote it beyond current rehabilitation treatments. Such
knowledge will assist in optimizing new neuromodulation-based rehabilitation approaches, such as the EDEN
clinical trials, to assist patients. Moreover, the proposed quantitative assessment approach can be expanded to
comparatively assess the efficacy of other rehabilitation treatments and other stroke models in an unbiased way.
Therefore, the proposed work will promote better understanding of the cortical reorganization process during
recovery and has the potential to assist in improving patient quality of life."

Neural tube defects (NTDs), including spina bifida (SB), have a devastating impact on the health and
development of infants and children, with economic, social, and physical demands or hardships placed on
caregivers. SB affects approximately 2,500 live births per year in the United States, with environmental and
genetic factors playing a role in its etiology. By combining bioengineering and placental-derived stem cell
approaches, the CuRe (Cellular Therapy for In Utero Repair of Myelomeningocele) trial has recently advanced
surgical effectiveness and improved clinical outcomes. However, in utero repair requiring fetal exposure at mid-
pregnancy to reduce the ongoing damage of the exposed spinal cord represents an invasive procedure. By
leveraging our expertise in the synthesis of biomimetic therapeutic strategies able to induce tissue repair by
inducing a regenerative cascade at the site of lesion and in the generation of genetically induced model systems,
this project aims to devise less invasive, novel intervention strategies for endogenous in utero repair of
SB. The overall hypothesis is that by creating a pro-regenerative environment within the amniotic cavity, it is
possible to activate the cellular and molecular cascades required to reduce the severity of SB lesions. To test
these hypotheses, we will i) determine the therapeutic efficacy of amniotic fluid-based cell free strategies to
modulate the in utero environment and reduce the severity of SB in a clinically relevant in-house mouse model
(Fbpk8 knockout mice) (Aim 1) and ii) evaluate the protective and regenerative potential of a biomimetic
thermogel for in utero repair of SB lesions in mouse and rabbit models (Aim 2). The proposed research is
expected to enhance our understanding with respect to the impact of biomimetic strategies inducive of
regeneration on the development of neural tube tissues following genetic and mechanical disruption. The
implications of these therapeutic intervention strategies are timely and critical, as stem cell-based, and
bioengineering approaches are already being deployed clinically in other areas, but a minimally invasive, early
in utero intervention is still needed for families and infants affected by SB."

Innate defensive behaviors promote survival by allowing animals to detect and respond to acute
threats within their environment, such as predators. Although innate, these defensive behaviors show
a remarkable amount of flexibility and are subject to robust habituation, suggesting that the circuitry
underlying defensive behaviors is subject to modulatory control. Our recent work suggests that the
cerebellum may provide one source of afferent modulatory influence within the periaqueductal gray.
We find that cerebellar afferents to the freezing-related circuitry in ventrolateral periaqueductal gray
(vlPAG) predominantly activate local dopaminergic interneurons, which subsequently alter the relative
strength of synaptically evoked inhibition and excitation onto freezing premotor neurons. More
specifically, cerebellar activation increases IPSC amplitudes and decreases EPSC amplitudes, which
is predicted to increase spike threshold and alter the input-output relationship, altering the integrative
properties of freezing premotor neurons. These synaptic changes are predicted to reduce the efficacy
with which synaptic input drives freezing, thereby providing a potential mechanism of behavioral
habituation across repeated trials. These results motivate testing the hypothesis that the cerebellum
modulates the expression of innate defensive behaviors through activation of local vlPAG dopamine
neurons. To test this hypothesis, a combination of in vivo behavioral and systems-level approaches
will be used to record and manipulate cerebellar activity during innate freezing behaviors to determine
the nature of the cerebellar signals produced, and their resulting effects on expression of freezing
behavior, respectively. To study the role of vlPAG dopamine neurons in modulating innate freezing
behaviors, I will similarly record and manipulate vlPAG dopamine neuron activity using fiber
photometry and optogenetic actuators. Finally, because selective lesions of vlPAG dopamine neurons
disrupt fear memory formation in mice (as do disruptions in cerebellar plasticity), I will test the
hypothesis that cerebellar associative plasticity contributes to fear memory formation by modulating
vlPAG dopamine activity. Together, these experiments provide a framework for understanding how
the cerebellum modulates innate freezing and more broadly how cerebellar plasticity contributes to
learned and innate defensive behaviors."
10979642,"The proper function of organisms, their organs, and their tissues requires them to have specific
shape. How this shape is specified and maintained is a fundamental question in biology. In
animals, the shape is determined through the process of morphogenesis, a concerted sequence
of tissue remodeling events leading up to the final body plan. Despite a long-standing effort to
understand the physical mechanisms that underlie morphogenesis, these mechanisms still
remain largely unknown. Basic considerations from physics imply that in order to completely
determine the mechanism of a morphogenetic change, two pieces of information are absolutely
required: (1) material/mechanical properties of the tissue, and (2) the active forces that drive
tissue deformation. Using Drosophila gastrulation as a model, and by combining biophysical,
molecular, and modeling methods, we propose an approach sufficient to determine both.
Recent work from our group and others has begun the process of quantifying the mechanical
properties of tissues as whole. However, it has become clear that mechanical properties vary in
different cellular regions (apical vs basal etc.), and that understanding these differences is
crucial for correctly understanding and accurately predicting morphogenesis. In Aim 1, we
expand upon our previously established techniques for measuring tissue mechanics, and apply
them to directly measure viscous and elastic properties of the apical, lateral, and basal cellular
compartments separately. In Aim 2, we will incorporate these measurements into a
comprehensive computational model to explain large-scale tissue behaviors based on these
microscopic measurements. From this model, we will also be able to extract the spatial and
temporal force profiles driving tissue morphogenesis in the early embryo. In Aim 3 we will
assess the predictive power of our model to predict mutant phenotypes, and we will also begin
identifying the molecular players that contribute to specific mechanical features such as
elasticity and mechanical memory. In summary, successful completion of the project will for the
first time establish a comprehensive biophysical mechanism of a key model system. Both the
techniques and general approach developed here will be applicable to a wide variety of tissue
morphogenesis processes."

Copper (Cu) is an essential micronutrient for nearly all forms of aerobic life because of its participation in key
redox reactions and reactions of O2 chemistry. Cu deficiency, accordingly, has an impact on multiple metabolic
and developmental pathways. Cu deficiency in animals and humans occurs because of genetic defects or in
situations of malnutrition. In previous work, Merchant and co-workers, using a model organism, Chlamydomonas
(an alga in the green lineage), discovered fundamental mechanisms and regulatory circuits for maintaining Cu
homeostasis that are broadly relevant. Specifically, the group showed that an abundant Cu protein, plastocyanin,
is replaced by an iron-containing heme protein, cytochrome (Cyt) c6, when Cu is scarce. The Cu that is spared
by this replacement is “upcycled” for use in Cyt oxidase in respiration. This switch allows maintenance of two
important bioenergetic pathways – photosynthesis and respiration. Genetic analysis identified a Cu-response
regulator (CRR1), a transcription factor that activates the CYC6 gene encoding Cyt c6 through associated Cu
response elements (CuREs) as well as ~64 other genes that form the nutritional Cu regulon, including
assimilatory Cu(I) transporters CTR1 and CTR2, enzymes of heme biosynthesis, and other factors that enable
Cu allocation to Cyt oxidase and that adjust thylakoid membrane properties to accommodate the substitute
protein. In this project period, the focus is on how CRR1 is turned off for tight homeostatic regulation of Cu
metabolism. In the working model, supported by substantial preliminary data, CRR1 activates the Cu regulon in
deficiency, while upon Cu supplementation, the protein is post-translationally modified, which marks CRR1 for
recognition and ubiquitylation by CEHC1/FBXO3, a newly discovered F-box protein, followed by proteasome-
dependent degradation. In this context, there are 3 aims. 1) Post-translational modifications of CRR1 in +Cu
cells will be captured by LC-MS following immunoprecipitation of CRR1 under specific conditions where the
protein accumulates, as in the cehc1 mutant. The site(s) of modification will be tested for their impact on Cu-
responsive degradation of CRR1, individually and in combination, by site-directed mutagenesis of CRR1. 2)
Physical interaction between CEHC1 and CRR1 will be tested by co-localization and captured by co-
immunoprecipitation, and the substrate binding domain of CEHC1 will be identified by mutation and tested in
vitro for binding to the Cu dependent degron. Candidate CRR1 modification enzymes or other components in
this regulatory circuit, such as a Cu sensor, will be discovered by exploiting a powerful gain-of-function classical
genetic screen for constitutively active CRR1 using CuRE-reporter constructs. 3) The operation of a post-
translational mechanism to regulate Cu uptake by CTRs will be evaluated by using quantitative proteomics to
measure Cu-dependent changes in half-life and by monitoring sub-cellular localization as a function of Cu supply.
The execution of this project will complete our picture of nutritional Cu signaling and homeostasis through
discovery of the feedback loop that keeps CRR1 off in the Cu replete cells."

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among the African American population. Although many
actionable biomarkers and targeted treatments are available to significantly prolong lung cancer survival, patients
of non-European ancestry are less likely to undergo next-generation sequencing testing and received targeted
therapies than their white counterparts. Structural and environmental factors likely contribute to this disparity;
however, there is evidence suggesting that somatic genomic differences also contribute – several lung cancer
drivers and targetable biomarkers have been found to have different alteration frequencies between populations.
However, African American patients are severely underrepresented in research studies and clinical trials, and
therefore, the genomic landscape of lung cancers with African ancestry remains poorly understood.
Our preliminary analysis based on real-world, observational data of clinical tumor sequencing suggest that the
prevalence of targetable alterations in KRAS and ROS1 fusion are different in patients of African ancestry,
independent to smoking status. Interestingly, ancestry may modify the effect of smoking exposure on the lung
cancer genome – TP53 mutations were significantly enriched in smokers but not in never smokers of African
ancestry. Moreover, there is a significant enrichment of high tumor mutation burden in light smokers compared
to their white counterparts, in line with previous studies showing higher risk of lung cancer in smokers of African
ancestry, suggesting different genomic mechanism as the resultant influence of ancestry-smoking interaction.
In this project, we will take three parallel approaches to comprehensively characterize lung cancer genomes in
patients of African ancestry. In the first aim, we will identify and validate more genomic differences between
patients with African and European ancestry, with a focus on drug targetable and clinically relevant biomarkers.
We will also locus-specific germline ancestry to identify the genetic and non-genetic contributors to somatic
differences. In the second aim, we will focus on investigating the interaction between African ancestry and
smoking exposure on somatic alterations and develop a computational pipeline leveraging off-target reads from
panel sequencing to study genome-wide germline influence. In the third aim, we will develop a deep learning
model to allow us further to understand the generalizability and ancestry-specificity of immunotherapy outcome
prediction. Finally, we will move beyond panel sequencing to identify new markers for patients of African
ancestry, using whole-genome sequencing coupled with RNA-sequencing.
The proposed study will broaden our knowledge about the complex relationship between genetic ancestry,
environmental exposure and ancestry-environment interaction contributing to genomic differences. The findings
will reveal germline factor associated with somatic phenotype, improve immunotherapy outcome prediction, and lead
to future study and discovery of new treatment options for African American patients."

 Dynamic PET myocardial perfusion imaging is emerging as a new modality to quantitatively measure
myocardial blood flow and flow reserve and has improved the diagnostic and prognostic assessments of
coronary artery disease (CAD) compared with other imaging techniques. However, flow quantification by the
standard three-dimensional (3D) approach faces a substantial noise challenge due to further dividing the noisy
tomographic data into shorter frames for image reconstruction before time activity curves are extracted for
kinetic analysis. Four-dimensional (4D) parametric image reconstruction incorporates kinetic modeling into
directly estimating parametric images from entire raw data. It has statistical advantages over the indirect 3D
method by accurately modeling noise in the projection space. However, direct parametric image estimation still
suffers from the inherent ill-posedness of the reconstruction problem, to which spatial regularization extensively
developed in static PET imaging has rarely been explored. Furthermore, 4D direct reconstruction has typically
been investigated at the concept implementation stage with very limited animal or patient study validation.
 In this project, we propose to develop novel data-driven motion corrected direct 4D parametric image
reconstruction techniques integrating unsupervised deep learning-based regularization to reduce noise while
maintaining quantitative accuracy in dynamic 82Rb PET MP imaging. We will develop and validate the
techniques in terms of global and regional noise reduction using large animal models of ischemia and
myocardial infarction (MI), patients with suspected ischemic heart disease (IHD), and patients following MI
referred for assessment of viability. The performance of the proposed method will be compared with the
standard indirect 3D approach and with non-regularized and other regularized 4D methods. We hypothesize
that the proposed techniques will significantly reduce measurement uncertainty of 82Rb kinetics, leading to
improved test-retest repeatability, diagnostic accuracy in evaluating IHD, and reliability in accessing myocardial
viability with rest 82Rb MP imaging alone.
 The proposed learning regularized direct 4D parametric reconstruction will be the first attempt to integrate
deep learning-based denoising to resolve the low signal to noise ratio challenge in dynamic PET imaging. The
advancements brought by this project will enable dynamic 82Rb imaging for 1) detection and risk stratification of
patients with obstructive CAD and ischemia with non-obstructive coronary arteries (INOCA), and 2)
identification of myocardial viability in patients with IHD referred for potential revascularization. In patients
referred for evaluation of myocardial viability, the proposed method will discriminate hibernating myocardium
from scar with a single rest 82Rb PET scan. The proposed efforts will revolutionize the evaluation and
management of patients with suspected or known CAD or those being considered for coronary
revascularization to increase clinical efficiency and reduce healthcare cost."

Parasitic worms constitute a major global public health burden, with approximately one-fifth of the
human population harboring one or more species within their gastrointestinal tract. We discovered
that rare chemosensory epithelial cells called tuft cells sense parasites and initiate a type 2
immune response in the small intestine. Subsequent investigations into tuft cells at other barrier
tissues throughout the body showed these cells respond to various microbial and environmental
triggers. However, despite the massive density of microbes in the colon, the activation of tuft cells
and their influence on type 2 immunity in the large intestine remains poorly understood. Several
studies demonstrated key differences between tuft cells in the small intestine and colon, including
distinct receptor profiles and divergent differentiation requirements. Recently, we found that
commensal tritrichomonad protists in the microbiome are far more diverse than previously
appreciated and stimulate colonic tuft cells and type 2 immunity independent of the tuft cell
agonist, succinate. In Aim 1, we will examine the impact of tritrichomonad-tuft cell interactions on
colonic immunity and determine the mechanisms colonic tuft cells use to initiate inflammation
within the large intestine. Aim 2 will identify the novel tuft cell receptor(s) activated by
tritrichomonads in the colon. Aim 3 will investigate the impact of colonic tuft cells on barrier
function, epithelial protein secretion, and mucosal resistance to enteric pathogens. The results of
this study will provide new insights into the microbial surveillance mechanisms of tuft cells in the
colon and their influence on mucosal immunity. This knowledge will also reveal the potential for
commensal protists to protect from enteric infections and provide a basis for using colonic tuft
cells to treat inflammatory disorders in the large intestine."

Prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a large and heterogeneous brain area comprising the front third of the human brain
that has been implicated in numerous mental health disorders. One of the least-studied subregions of PFC is
anterior lateral PFC (aLPFC). This region, whose functioning is impacted in disorders like schizophrenia, has
been implicated in reasoning, multi-tasking, planning, memory monitoring, decision-making, and more. It
behooves us to reach a mechanistic understanding of the fundamental processes subserved by this region;
however, there are numerous challenges, including the absence of a precise animal model, inconsistencies
regarding terminology and anatomical boundaries, lack of attention to individual variability in anatomy, lack of
high-resolution imaging in living participants, and limited evaluation of the generalizability of its function. In
response to these challenges, we seek to do a deep dive on its anatomy and function at the individual level in
neurotypical adults, using cutting-edge MRI technology. Leading theories presuppose that aLPFC has a
domain-general function, processing abstracted representations that are far removed from initial inputs to the
brain. However, this assumption has yet to be carefully tested. Here, we capitalize on a body of work
implicating a portion of aLPFC in relational reasoning, or the ability to reason about information by jointly
consider several sets of mental representations. First, we seek to evaluate the claim of domain-generality by
assessing aLPFC's activation and interactions with other brain regions during performance of four relational
reasoning tasks; these tasks involve both visual and—for the first time—auditory domains, as well as
visuospatial and semantic (or ""where"" and ""what"") stimuli processed by different posterior brain regions.
Second, to better localize aLPFC activation during reasoning at the single subject level, we seek to assess
whether small sulci (grooves) serve as functional landmarks, predicting the location of this functionally defined
region. Third, we seek to leverage the exquisite spatial resolution of our NexGen 7 Tesla MR scanner and a
combination of two fMRI methods to test whether aLPFC activation during reasoning is predominantly localized
to superficial cortical layers, consistent with involvement in local recurrent connectivity that supports integration
of high-level mental representations. Fourth, theories of PFC organization either presuppose that aLPFC
receives inputs exclusively from other PFC regions or that it also has long-range connections to more domain-
sensitive regions in parietal and temporal cortices. Thus, we seek to use high-resolution diffusion-weighted
imaging at 7 Tesla to shed light on the provenance of inputs to aLPFC. With strong expertise in PFC function,
neuroanatomy, high-field MR imaging technology, and MRI analytic approaches, our team is poised to yield
novel insights about PFC function. This study is both theoretically and technologically innovative and will yield
a valuable shared dataset. Better characterizing aLPFC structure and function could yield insights for early
identification of disordered thinking in neurodevelopmental conditions such as schizophrenia."

Protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) can activate, inhibit, or modify protein’s function. Small molecules
that inhibit enzymes that induce PTMs (e.g., kinases for phosphorylation) are available in abundance, but
methods to induce a given PTM of any protein on demand are challenging to develop. We propose to develop a
new class of small molecules which will induce protein phosphorylation by using a kinase inhibitor to recruit the
given kinase to phosphorylate a neo-substrate. These molecules will be formed by joining a small-molecule
kinase inhibitor with a small-molecule binder of the target protein so that an active kinase is brought into proximity
to the target protein to initiate phosphorylation.

metabolite highly abundant in the brain, promotes fungal traversal of the BBB and plays a critical role in host-
pathogen interactions during infection of the central nervous system (CNS). In our previous funding period, we
have demonstrated that Cn contains an unusually complex inositol uptake system that is distinct from those
characterized in other fungi. Thus, Cn may be uniquely adapted to thrive in the inositol-rich environment of the
CNS and to utilize inositol-dependent pathways for pathogenesis. Our data have confirmed that (1) growth of Cn
under inositol-rich conditions enhanced virulence in the murine model, (2) fungal cells deficient in inositol uptake
and catabolism were also deficient in virulence during CNS infection, (3) inositol induced production of fungal
capsule, a major virulence factor, and hyaluronic acid, a cell surface molecule involved in fungal binding to the
BBB, and (4) inositol induced a unique capsule structure enriched in a specific mannosylated structure group
that helps the fungus evade the host immune response. We also identified an inositol receptor Itr4 and a
transcription factor Hlh6 that are required for inositol function in Cn. Our central hypothesis is that cryptococcal
cells sense and utilize host inositol to modify the fungal cell surface in a way that promotes penetration of the
BBB and development of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis. The overarching goal of this proposal is to
understand how this pathogen senses and utilizes host nutrient inositol to establish human brain infections. To
further test our hypothesis, we propose two related but independent Specific Aims: 1) Characterize Inositol
mediated fungal cell surface modification in Cryptococcus-host interaction using genetics, molecular biology and
biophysical approaches in combination of in vitro BBB system and in vivo animal models. Fungal strains with
single motif capsule structure will be utilized for this study. 2) Define the inositol sensing and regulatory
mechanism important for fungal pathogenesis by characterizing the inositol sensor Itr4 and inositol transcription
factors and the pathways they regulated. Moreover, we will test a number of inhibitors on inositol function for
their potential antifungal activity to explore the possibility to develop the fungal inositol function as a potential
therapeutic target. The proposed study will provide a mechanistic understanding of inositol utilization in Cn and
its effects on fungal pathogenesis, especially during CNS infections."

Driver mutations confer increased fitness to cancer cells but can also encode neoantigens that stimulate an anti-
cancer immune response. This anti-tumor immunity is mediated primarily by T cell receptor (TCR) recognition of
mutation-derived peptides presented on Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) complexes. L858R promotes
unchecked growth and is the most common epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation in lung cancer,
accounting for 40% of all observed mutations in the protooncogene. How L858R may stimulate an anti-tumor
immune response is not yet understood. The objective of the proposed work is to understand the mechanisms
through which the EGFR L858R mutation affects tumor biology in provoking anti-tumor immunity. My preliminary
data show that L858R-derived peptides are capable of binding to and stabilizing HLA-A*03:01 and HLA-A*11:01
complexes. In two orthogonal assays, L858R peptide-HLA (pHLA) complexes stimulate CD8+ T cells more
strongly than wild-type EGFR pHLA complexes. Finally, using pHLA multimer flow cytometry, I have identified
CD8+ T cells from healthy donor PBMCs that recognize the L858R pHLA complex through their TCRs. I
hypothesize that the EGFR L858R mutation generates an immunogenic neoantigen that provokes T cell-
mediated anti-tumor immunity due to the high clonality of the mutation. In Aim 1, I will fully define determinants
of L858R immunogenicity by characterizing the EGFR L858R-derived neopeptide and its ability to activate T
cells. I will employ HLA immunoprecipitation coupled to liquid chromatography mass spectrometry to identify the
L858R peptides presented on HLA, determine the relative contributions of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the immune
response, and examine exhaustion phenotypes in L858R-specific T cells from patients using single cell RNA
and TCR sequencing. In Aim 2, I will determine the ability of EGFR L858R-specific T cells to suppress tumor
growth. I will also determine how mutation clonality and pHLA expression affect the anti-tumor immune response.
This study employs cutting edge genetic tools and computational approaches to generate a detailed
understanding of adaptive immunity against somatic mutations in tumors. Furthermore, this proposal is tailored
for a physician-scientist in training, as it investigates clinically relevant determinants of a T cell-mediated immune
response against EGFR-mutant cancers, and will inform the development of an adoptive T cell therapy for a
large subset of lung cancer patients."

By 2030, the majority of World Trade Center (WTC) rescue and recovery workers (responders) will be aged 65
and over and at risk for aging-related conditions and consequences. Because the WTC General Responder
Cohort (WTC-GRC) is aging (median age is 61 in 2023), the WTC Health Program (WTCHP) needs to be
prepared to deliver care that is best aligned to the needs of the aging WTC responder population. Frailty, a
common geriatric syndrome characterized by increased vulnerability to adverse events including mortality,
morbidity, disability and hospitalizations is prevalent among the WTC-GRC population and will likely continue
to grow as the population ages. Our team has previously demonstrated that approximately 30% of the WTC-
GRC meets criteria for frailty, an association that increases with age, WTC exposure, and by occupation type
(e.g., higher risk among construction worker). These findings underscore an urgent need for the targeting of
potential vulnerabilities of this population as they age. This project will investigate two key questions central to
developing aging-related interventions in the WTCHP. The first question is to understand how evidence-based
healthy aging interventions can be best implemented in the WTCHP to meet the needs of WTC responders.
This study will examine the implementation of a deprescribing intervention as an evidence-based practice to
improve the use of medications in aging populations. Key information about implementation of this practice in
the Mount Sinai WTCHP will be examined to identify barriers to implementation and identify strategies,
processes and tools to support its implementation. Perspectives from key stakeholders at a novel site for the
evidence-based practice will be collected in order to prepare for further dissemination of this deprescribing
intervention. The second question is to understand health priorities of the WTC-GRC as they age. Examination
of these health priorities will allow for further planning of healthy aging initiatives, as well as selection and
prioritization of additional evidence-based practices needed in future efforts to support WTC responders.
Results of this project will be instrumental in improving the capacity of WTCHP to care for aging responders
through partnership with Mount Sinai's nationally recognized Geriatrics and Palliative Care programs including
the development of future widespread multifactorial programs tailored to WTC responders to promote healthy
aging."

Disruptions in retinal structures are largely thought to contribute to reduced visual function. The diagnosis and
management of diseases which cause disruptions in retinal structures relies on the ability to non-invasively
assess the living retina. Adaptive optics (AO) based imaging tools have enabled visualization of retinal structure
at the cellular level and have enabled high resolution functional testing. However, previous AO-centric studies
have classically evaluated retinal structure and function independently. This results in a significant gap in our
understanding of how variations in retinal structure in turn impact measures of retinal function. Closing
this gap is essential for advancing functional assays and improving our understanding of how
disruptions to retinal structures impact visual function. Here, we will explore the relationship between retinal
structure and function in vivo using an adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) based
psychophysical task to measure AO-corrected visual acuity in individuals with disruptions to their retinal structure
caused by albinism. We will also improve our understanding of a new functional assay for probing individual
photoreceptor cells, intensity based optoretinography (iORG), by quantifying how natural variation in the eye that
occurs throughout the day due to circadian rhythm, and how different spectral cone types contribute to variations
seen in this signal. We will accomplish this through the following two aims: Aim 1) examine how disruptions in
foveal anatomical specializations impact visual function using AOSLO-based tools. Through investigating the
relationship between the Nyquist sampling limit of the foveal photoreceptor mosaic and adaptive optics corrected
visual acuity in individuals with albinism I hope to gain important insight on if disruptions to foveal private line
circuitry could drive the variable visual acuity reported in these individuals; Aim 2) characterize factors which
cause variation in iORG measurements in individual and populations of cones. In order to improve iORG and
gain a better understanding on how experimental procedures such as the time day in which data was collected
and the distribution of different spectral cone types impact variations in iORG metrics we will investigate the
degree to which these factors contribute to variations seen in iORG signals. Completion of this research project
will provide insight on how variations in retinal structures impact visual function in living humans. In addition, this
project will improve a diagnostic tool (iORG) which can be used to probe individual photoreceptor function in
vivo. Beyond the scientific advancements this research seeks to accomplish, this also presents a unique training
opportunity which combines retinal imaging, optics, software development, engineering principles, and clinical
experience. The proposed research training plan will provide me with valuable technical, research,
communication, and professional development skills that will be of great benefit to my future career as a
biomedical engineer and vision researcher."

Several aggressive types of breast cancer (BCa) are nutritionally reliant on glutamine metabolism, and glutamine
uptake has been shown to be enhanced in BCa bone-homing clonal cell populations. This is especially significant
as bone metastasis will occur in approximately 70% of women with metastatic BCa and remain clinically
incurable. The enzyme glutaminase (GLS) catalyzes the conversion of glutamine to glutamate, and I have shown
that its loss in bone tropic BCa cell lines results in reduced osteolysis. During outgrowth of bone metastases,
bone destruction is driven by changes in bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-degrading osteoclasts, known as
the “vicious cycle.” As the metabolic conversion catalyzed by GLS is also essential to osteoblast lineage
commitment, a genetically modified mouse model was used to delete Gls in osteoblast progenitors. Surprisingly,
loss of GLS function in osteoblast progenitors led to reduced bone destruction and osteoclast numbers. This
proposal seeks to identify the mechanisms by which glutamine metabolism in the bone niche influences bone
destruction and how they could be exploited therapeutically. I hypothesize that loss of functional GLS in bone-
tropic BCa cells induces a senescence-like phenotype that reduces tumor burden and confers sensitivity to
senolytic therapy while GLS loss in osteoblast progenitors limits release of osteoclastogenic signals, reducing
bone destruction by cutting off the “vicious cycle.” In Specific Aim 1, I will follow up on data from an RNA-seq
analysis, which indicated upregulation of Ypel2 (Yippee-like protein 2) in GLS KO cells, a gene that has been
linked to cell cycle arrest and senescence in endothelial cells. I will use CRISPR/Cas9 to KO and overexpress
Ypel2 in various GLS WT and KO breast cancer cell lines and test for cell cycle activity and detect markers of
senescence. I will also test for the presence and levels of osteolytic factors such as PTHrP (in vitro) and RANKL
(in vivo). Finally, I will test the effect of genetic deletion and pharmacologic inhibition of GLS (CB-839) on
sensitivity of aggressive breast cancer cell lines E0771, 4T1-2, and MDA-MB-231-BoM to senolytic treatment in
vitro and in vivo. In Specific Aim 2, to determine the effect of osx-driven GLS KO (GLSOBKO) on osteoblast
differentiation and function, I will co-culture osteoblasts from mice with GLSOBKO with bone-tropic BCa cells ex
vivo and test for osteoblast differentiation and function, including production of osteoblast-specific proteins
(RUNX2, OPN, OCN, etc.). This will allow me to determine the effect of tumor cell signaling on the compromised
osteoblast progenitors. To determine the effect of GLS loss in osteoblast progenitors on osteoclastogenesis and
osteoclast function in tumor-bearing bones, I will perform RNA-scope analysis and Tartrate-Resistant Acid
Phosphatase (TRAP) staining on tissue sections from GLSOBKO mice and wild type controls. Findings from this
research have the potential to provide new information about a highly morbid, yet incurable manifestation of
metastatic breast cancer and could even raise the possibility of using pre-existing cancer therapies targeting
glutamine metabolism to ameliorate bone metastatic burden in breast cancer."

While some barriers and facilitators to parent presence and participation (PPP) in the neonatal intensive care
unit (NICU) have been identified, comprehensive descriptions of factors influencing PPP and changes in these
factors over time are lacking. Moreover, race- and socioeconomic-based disparities in PPP have been reported,
but the underlying causes of these disparities are unknown. To increase health equity for preterm infants and
their parents, the underlying factors influencing disparities in PPP must be identified. PPP is critical to
improving clinical outcomes and neurodevelopment for preterm infants. The purpose of the proposed study is
to comprehensively determine barriers and facilitators affecting PPP in the NICU and effects of PPP on infant
outcomes. Using a non-experimental, longitudinal design, the following specific aims and subaims will be
accomplished: (Aim 1) determine barriers and facilitators affecting PPP and changes in barriers and facilitators
over time; (Subaim 1) predict barriers and facilitators of PPP based on sociodemographic characteristics; (Aim
2) determine the effect of PPP on infant clinical outcomes and neurodevelopment; (Subaim 2) determine the
mediation effect of parent-infant responsiveness on the relationship between PPP and infant clinical outcomes
and neurodevelopment; (Aim 3) determine the moderation effect of PPP on the relationship between infant
stress exposure and infant clinical outcomes and neurodevelopment. Parents with an infant born less than 32
weeks gestational age will be enrolled. Parents will complete surveys throughout their infant’s hospitalization
to identify barriers and facilitators influencing PPP and to quantify their experiences of discrimination and
parent-staff engagement in the NICU. PPP will be quantified by parent-report, electronic health record
documentation, and NICU visitation logs. Infant clinical outcomes, including length of NICU stay and
achievement of oral feeding competence, will be measured throughout hospitalization and at discharge.
Neurodevelopment will be assessed at 3-months corrected age using the Test of Infant Motor Performance and
12-months corrected age using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 4th Edition. Parent-infant
responsiveness at discharge and 3-months corrected age will be determined as will the moderating effect of
PPP on infant stress exposure throughout hospitalization. The study focuses on modifiable factors that may
disparately affect parents from racially underrepresented groups or those lacking financial and social
resources. By also considering demographic characteristics that may contribute to disparities, the study will
provide data to support the development of NICU interventions to equitably promote PPP, thus improving
outcomes for preterm infants and their families. This proposal addresses the research priority area of the
NICHD’s Pregnancy and Perinatology Branch to advance the science of preterm birth and its cons equences
while incorporating the NICHD’s aspirational goal to enhance the healthy development of preterm infants and
cross-cutting theme of addressing health disparities."
10978628,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by dysfunction of the CF Transmembrane
Conductance Regulator (CFTR) channel. The care of patients with CF has rapidly evolved with the
development of CFTR modulators, novel pharmaceuticals that address the basic CF defect and restore CFTR
function. Most recently, a triple combination therapy, TC, has revolutionized the care of most patients (~90% of
the population in the U.S.). However, as TC has been expanded in use, about a quarter of people with CF
don’t have the robust response that were seen in the clinical trials, and others have neuropsychological side
effects that limit tolerability. The compounds of TC are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP3A enzymes).
Genetic variation in these enzymes cause altered activity, resulting in variation in efficacy in many drugs and
side effect profiles. Our preliminary data demonstrate considerable variation in TC concentrations in patients
during real-world use, which is a concern given the dose-dependence of TC effect in the lung and other
tissues. This study will provide innovative data on concentration variability among the largest observational
study of TC use in people with CF, as well as novel data on pharmacogenetic variation in this population, and
prospective data on the utility of concentration data and dose titration to optimize the clinical response of TC in
the lungs, as well as throughout the body. Our prospective study is also designed to evaluate a balance
between lung function response from TC and side effect profiles, particularly of an increasingly observed effect
causing neuropsychological deterioration (i.e., worsening anxiety, depression, and cognition). The Specific
Aims are: 1) Analyze population pharmacokinetics of the three TC compounds in plasma to determine
pharmacokinetic parameters during real-world use and correlate drug exposure with drug response; 2) to
determine novel genetic variants in relevant pharmacogenes associated with concentration or response to TC
including pulmonary measures; 3) conduct a prospective study to ascertain the TC concentration relationship
with neuropsychological side effects and assess the utility of dose titration to balance side effects with optimal
pulmonary (and other organ system) responses to TC. To accomplish the goals of this research, the principal
investigator has assembled a unique mentoring team with decades of experience in clinical trials,
pharmacology, genetics, statistics, pharmacogenetics, psychology and drug metabolism. Together, we will shift
the paradigm of care for CF by better understanding of the optimal concentration and dosing for individual’s
lung function and tolerance of therapy, and transition to a truly personalized and patient-centered approach to
modulator therapy."

Fibrinogen is a multifunctional plasma protein that, after conversion into polymeric fibrin, promotes
hemostasis and plays a pivotal role in various physiological and pathological processes, including wound
healing, thrombosis, atherogenesis, tumorigenesis, and more. Inflammation and angiogenesis are integral
parts of wound healing; however, in pathological settings, these two processes contribute to the development
of inflammation-related cardiovascular diseases and the progression of tumor growth and metastasis. Our
previous studies primarily focused on the newly discovered fibrin-VLDL receptor-dependent inflammatory
pathway, which promotes the transendothelial migration of leukocytes and, consequently, inflammation. In
these studies, we established the molecular mechanism underlying this pathway and hypothesized that the
fibrin-derived β15-42 fragment, which was shown to exhibit significant protective effects in numerous
inflammation-related animal models, inhibits this pathway by interacting with a putative receptor. Recently,
we discovered that endothelial N-cadherin is a novel receptor for fibrin. Our extensive preliminary data
suggest that N-cadherin is a putative receptor for β15-42, and the interaction of fibrin with this receptor
promotes angiogenesis. Based on these data and our previous findings, we propose to characterize the
novel fibrin-(N-cadherin) interaction and establish its role in fibrin-dependent inflammation and angiogenesis.
Specifically, we aim to establish the structural basis for the fibrin-(N-cadherin) interaction (Specific Aim 1),
test our hypothesis that N-cadherin is a putative receptor for the β15-42 fragment, whose interaction with this
receptor inhibits leukocyte transmigration (Specific Aim 2), and test our hypothesis that fibrin-(N-cadherin)
interaction triggers fibrin-dependent angiogenesis (Specific Aim 3). Additionally, we intend to design novel,
efficient inhibitors of the fibrin-(N-cadherin) interaction with potent anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic
properties. These inhibitors may be developed as potential therapeutics for treating fibrin-dependent
inflammatory disorders and angiogenesis-related tumorigenesis."

Advances in human genetics have identified 400+ genes that when amplified or mutated promote
tumorigenesis. While there has been substantial success in developing drugs for kinases and metabolic
enzymes deregulated in cancer, they represent only a tiny fraction of the cancer drivers discovered to date.
The vast majority (~80%) of these cancer drivers remain undrugged, in part, because of their druggability
remains unknown. Among these undrugged oncogenes are transcription factors which represent a large
fraction of cancer drivers but are notoriously considered undruggable. To address this challenge, our lab has
deployed state-of-the art cysteine-focused chemical proteomics to profile the ligandable cysteines in 300+
cancer models representing 23 tumor types. This pan-cancer DrugMap identifies thousands of ligandable sites
across the cancer proteome, revealing both common and uniquely ligandable sites across cancer subtypes. By
incorporating gene essentiality with cysteine ligandability, we uncovered that multiple lineage restricted
transcription factors may make promising candidates for small molecule inhibitor development. At the top of
this list, was SOX10 a transcription factor (TF) required for the proliferation of >85% of melanoma models,
which contained a highly ligandable cysteine in a conserved domain. We demonstrate that mutation of this
cysteine disrupts SOX10 transcriptional activity, forming the basis to undertake a covalent small molecule
screen, which identified a chemical probe that disrupts SOX10 activity. An exploratory medicinal chemistry
campaign yielded more potent analogs, that disrupt the SOX10 transcriptional complex, block melanoma
transcriptional networks and abrogate the proliferation of melanoma models that are addicted to SOX10. In
this grant application, we build on our core chemical proteomic platform and incorporate advances in
biochemical/biophysical methodologies, synthetic chemistry and patient derived melanoma models to: 1)
define the mechanism by which SOX10 liganding disrupts its transcriptional activity; 2) develop potent and
specific tool compounds targeting SOX10 and 3) characterize the impact of its pharmacological disruption on
transcriptional networks and proliferation of advanced melanoma models. The research proposed herein,
takes full advantage of advances in human genetics and functional genomics which nominates SOX10 as a
primary target required for melanoma growth and combines them with ultra-high throughput chemical
proteomic technologies to define the druggability of this TF cancer driver. This approach is a critical first step in
the development of targeted therapies against a class of proteins traditionally considered beyond the realm of
pharmacological intervention. If successful, the development of this chemical probe has the potential to
radically reshape the next-generation of targeted anti-cancer therapies."

This proposal seeks Dr. Serganova's salary support as a Research Specialist to support Dr. Roberta
Zappasodi's research program at Weill Cornell Medicine, Department Hematology and Oncology, to study the
role of T-cell responses during immunotherapy in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). DLBCL is the most
common lymphoid neoplasm in adults accounting for ~35% of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Despite of
relatively good responses to standard treatments, ~40% of patients develop therapy resistance. DLCBLs are
genetically heterogeneous and are divided on several subtypes. The MCD-DLBCL subtype is the most
clinically aggressive and therapy resistant DLBCL, requiring development of novel therapeutic approaches.
One such approach could involve combination with immunotherapy. However, cancer cells evade immune
destruction and Dr. Serganova is set to understand the molecular mechanisms of this evasion using her
unique experience and expertise in tumor biology, cancer models, and imaging approaches.
During previous studies, Dr. Serganova interests were centered on the development of various imaging
modalities to understand the complexity of tumor biology in cells and tumors in mice. Recently, in the frame of
R50 grant, Dr. Serganova has successfully explored how the modulation of the glycolytic pathway changes the
tumor microenvironment and controls the growth of the primary tumors, metastases development, and anti-
tumor response during the immunotherapy. Preliminary data acquired during this period show that metabolic
deficiencies in tumor cells affect many parameters of the TME, including T cells content and alterations in the
vasculature-immune TME compartment with the impact on the tumor vasculature permeability. These studies
provide the unique foundation to investigate immunotherapy failures through non-invasive monitoring T cell
trafficking, activation and persistence, and understand how interactions between tumor metabolism,
microenvironment, targeted antigen expression, and T cell function contribute to evasion of tumor cells from
immune destruction.
Dr. Serganova is exceptional scientist who has made seminal contributions to the laboratory's research

10978751,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Imaging modalities routinely used in the diagnostic workup, i.e., mammography, ultrasound, and MRI, can catch
breast cancers at an early stage based on structural abnormalities but lack in providing physiological information
relevant to the function of tissue that determines tumor malignancy. Currently, the U.S. national benchmark of
positive predictive value for malignancy at biopsy after a BI-RADS 4 or 5 diagnostic assessment (PPV3) is only
30.4%. This means about 7 out of 10 biopsies come back negative for cancer. Prior research has demonstrated
that diffusion optical tomography (DOT), as a complementary functional imaging modality to clinical breast
imaging, bears ample potential for differentiating malignant and benign breast lesions to reduce unnecessary
biopsies. However, the clinical utility of DOT for breast cancer diagnosis is limited by two factors. First, due to
limited contrast recovery, conventional DOT has been primarily validated in patients with large masses, leaving
its ability to characterize smaller lesions often seen in the diagnostic population untested. Second, DOT image
reconstruction (recon) is complex and time-consuming, incompatible with the need for timely clinical decision-
making. This project aims to address these translational barriers by developing and validating a two-pronged
DeepTOBIDx approach that leverages, on the one hand, a seamless integration between high-density DOT and
diagnostic spot compression for lesion-targeted DBT-DOT imaging, and the other, a novel multimodal DNN
model to achieve unprecedented image quality with no human-in-the-loop. From the hardware aspect (Aim 1),
we will engineer a pair of removable optical probes that house more source and detector optodes to achieve
seamless integration of high-density DOT with the DBT spot compression paddle for high-resolution imaging on
targeted lesions. From the image recon aspect (Aim 2), we will develop a novel multimodal DNN to directly map
sensor-domain DOT data to the image domain and further leverage the anatomical DBT to instantaneously
obtain optical images of unprecedented quality. The synthetic-to-real domain adaptation of the DNN model is
adequately addressed by using VICTRE and patient-derived anthropomorphic digital phantoms to represent
complex breast anatomy and lesion characteristics and by adding a realistic noise profile of the imaging system
modeled by a generative adversarial network from real measurements. Finally, in Aim 3, the clinical value of the
DeepTOBIDx approach will be assessed in a rigorously designed blinded multi-reader study on a 210-patient
prospective cohort to determine if the joint interpretation of clinical and DOT images can effectively reduce the
number of unnecessary biopsies. If validated successfully, DeepTOBIDx can facilitate the integration of DOT
with diagnostic mammography in clinical practice and result in direct benefit to breast cancer patients by avoiding
unnecessary procedures and associated burdens. The proposed deep learning-based image recon framework
could also benefit broader clinical applications using other tomographic imaging modalities."
10978564,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acute Respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening condition caused by widespread pulmonary
inflammation leading to lung injury. ARDS has a mortality that can be higher than 40% and is the main cause of
death from COVID-19. Although necessary to support life, mechanical ventilation worsens ARDS. While
computed tomography (CT) is capable of identifying characteristic abnormal airspace mechanics, the pulmonary
circulation is also altered in ARDS, with profound dysregulation of lung perfusion resulting in regional elevations
of blood flow and volume. Such misdistribution may significantly impact the trajectory of lung injury. In animal
studies, ventilated lungs suffered from stress-failure of the capillary barrier when perfused at higher blood flows
and pressures, resulting in more edema. Regions of the lung with elevated perfusion may therefore be at risk of
worse injury. The pulmonary circulation is significantly understudied in ARDS due to the paucity of accurate and
non-invasive instruments to visualize perfusion in vivo. This proposal addresses the need to elucidate the
fundamental contribution of the pulmonary circulation to ARDS trajectory. We intend to develop a comprehensive
imaging approach to characterize lung perfusion and direct treatment. We will leverage our expertise with two
imaging modalities: a) dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) and dual energy CT (DECT), which map pulmonary
blood flow and volume with high resolution; b) electrical impedance tomography (EIT), a bedside technique that
allows rapid and frequent assessments of pulmonary perfusion without moving patients to a scanner. We will
use these techniques in animal and human studies to test our hypothesis that protecting the capillary barrier and
manipulating pulmonary perfusion to decrease capillary stress failure attenuates ARDS progression. In a
ventilated swine model of ARDS, we will demonstrate that reducing the heterogeneity of pulmonary perfusion
mitigates lung injury using two treatments that redistribute pulmonary blood flow and volume: selective
vasodilation with inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) and prone ventilation. We will match regional changes in perfusion
and inflation with the subsequent progression of lung injury. We will then show that protecting the pulmonary
capillaries in vulnerable lung regions decreases injury using Imatinib, a drug that preserves endothelial integrity,
in our swine model. Finally, after refining our translational imaging pipeline, we will perform proof-of-principle
studies in human ARDS using DECT and EIT to assess individual patient responses to iNO and prone ventilation,
aiming to integrate such information into clinical decision-making. This proposal will demonstrate that it is
possible to non-invasively assess pulmonary perfusion in order to guide ARDS treatment. Shifting the focus from
airspace mechanics to a more comprehensive management of both lung perfusion and ventilation, the proposed
approach will constitute a groundbreaking advancement in the care of ARDS."

 Exocrine pancreas diseases like chronic pancreatitis (CP) and pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) can engender type 3c diabetes mellitus (T3cD: also called
pancreatogenic diabetes), a form of human diabetes that is distinct, but shares some features of
type 1 and 2 diabetes. It is increasingly recognized that T3cD likely represents a substantial
fraction of all diabetes in some populations, but the cellular, genetic and signaling basis of T3cD
are poorly understood. To address this knowledge 'gap' we created a tissue procurement
workflow focused on CP patients, and investigated primary islets from these subjects. We found
evidence for deranged gene expression in islet alpha cells and excessive glucagon secretion,
preceding overt T3cD. Other analysis suggests that a combination of increased pro-
inflammatory and reduced anti-inflammatory signaling may lead to dysregulated incretin
signaling in alpha cells.
 Thus, we postulate that CP could promote early stages of T3cD by impairing alpha cell
regulation. To test this, we propose in Aim 1 to study gene regulation and electrophysiology in
primary human islet cells procured from subjects with CP and CP with prediabetes, and to test
the hypothesis that incretin-regulated glucagon secretion is enhanced in prediabetes. In Aim 2
we will use modern multiplexed imaging methods (CODEX) and in vitro islet studies to test the
hypothesis that specific inflammatory signaling pathways in CP alter alpha cell gene regulation
and function, leading to excessive glucagon secretion. Together, our studies could identify
mechanisms of alpha cell dysfunction that occur very early in the development of T3cD.
Development of T3cD in CP is thought to presage PDAC; thus, our work could strongly
influence work on identifying biomarkers of PDAC at stages when surgery and other
therapeutics can be applied with curative intent."
10997032,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is a fundamental gap in the understanding of how biological sex impacts highly integrated innate immune
and metabolic responses to affect individual infection susceptibility. The overall goal of this proposal is to define
the role of sex-specific traits in influencing energetic trade-offs that underlie innate immune responses and dictate
infection susceptibility. Ancient stressors such as nutritional shortage and pathogenic challenges pushed
organisms to develop tightly regulated and highly integrated adaptive metabolic and innate immune responses
(referred to as immuno-metabolic responses). Recent studies have shown that the modulation of energy storage
and consumption via immuno-metabolic networks is shaped by external environmental pressures as well as
internal cues throughout an individual’s life. Specifically, events such as prior infections or developmental growth
rates often dictate the allocation of lipid energy storage, resulting in energetic trade-offs that prioritize key fitness
traits and contribute to inter-individual variation in susceptibility to infection. Additionally, there are sex-based
variations in pathogen susceptibility across taxa. While it is evident that the dysregulation of normal reciprocal
interactions between reproductive and immune systems can lead to diseases affecting one or both systems, it
is less understood how sex-specific traits involved in reproduction shape metabolic activity, energetic trade-offs,
and responses to pathogenic infection. These nebulous connections prompted interest to untangle the complex
integration of sex-specific traits, metabolism, and innate immunity through a tractable model. This proposal will
use the Drosophila melanogaster genetic model to test the hypothesis that post-mating changes specifically in
the female reproductive tissue, but not male, can influence immuno-metabolic responses and energetic trade-
offs (lipid storage and usage) that ultimately impact infection susceptibility. Aim I of this proposal will assess the
impact of male and female post-mating reproductive changes on immuno-metabolic responses and infection
susceptibility. Aim II will leverage recent advances in sequencing techniques to generate a single-nucleus
transcriptomic map to describe infection- and sex-dependent gene expression changes, highlighting the
integration of biological sex, immunity, and metabolism and the impact of continuous gene interaction on bacterial
infection outcome. To be succinct, this proposal intends to show that reproductive physiology specifically in
females determines energetic trade-offs that shape immuno-metabolic responses and lead to pathogen
susceptibility. Defining the energetic trade-offs that underlie interactions between reproductive activity and
immune responses will provide fundamental insight on not just that sexes differ, but how and why they differ
when faced by similar pathogens - which may also provide insight into sex-specific pathogen-related disease

spectrum disorder (ASD). It can cause significant quality of life deficits through maladaptive sensory seeking and
avoiding behaviors. Foxp2 is a transcription factor expressed in the developing and mature brain. Mutations in
human FOXP2 have been linked to NDDs, ASD, and most notably speech and language disorders. Foxp2 has
selective expression in the brain including several areas involved in the auditory processing pathway including
layer VI corticothalamic projection neurons (CThPNs), in the cells in auditory cortex (AC) and cells in the inferior
colliculi (IC), a midbrain region crucial in auditory processing. Preliminary studies of the loss of Foxp2 in the
mouse IC show sensory gating deficits and cell population changes. However, the role for Foxp2 in the
developing and mature auditory sensory areas of the neocortex and brainstem, remains to be fully elucidated.
This proposal will address the role of Foxp2 in the developing AC and IC at single nuclei resolution to identify
downstream targets of and chromatin accessibility changes by Foxp2. With two regions, single nuclei
transcriptomic (snRNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility data (snATAC-seq) can identify unique and overlapping
genes and regulatory pathways which will help elucidate the role of Foxp2 in each region and region-specific cell
types in sensory processing. Ex vivo recordings will also identify changes in cell and circuit function with
electrophysiological recordings of single and paired cells to find circuit and synapse dysregulation and cellular
excitability alterations caused by the loss of Foxp2. I hypothesize that Foxp2 has a critical role in sensory
processing mediated through proper cortical and IC neural development. I predict Foxp2 regulates cell
type-specific transcriptional networks with both cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous effects in gene
regulation, chromatin accessibility, and influences cell and circuit dysfunction underlying the sensory processing
deficits seen in ASD and other NDDs as a risk gene. Aim 1 will utilize paired snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq to
determine how conditional deletion of Foxp2 affects cellular expression profiles of the AC and IC across
development. I hypothesize that Foxp2-cKO will have ASD-related gene dysregulation, chromatin accessibility
patterns, and cell type imbalances in cortical and IC neurons. Aim 2 will assess the cortical and IC cell and circuit
electrophysiology regulated by Foxp2. I hypothesize that the loss of Foxp2 expression in the cortex and IC will
have circuit and cellular level changes that will result in changes in intrinsic excitability, interfering with thalamic
signaling. These data will be generated through whole cell recordings to determine the intrinsic electrophysiologic
properties of both AC Layer VI CThPNs and IC excitatory neurons as well as paired stimulation and recording of
IC and AC projections and synaptic connections to the thalamus. Together, these Aims will uncover the
developmental contribution of Foxp2 to cell type specification and circuit function in brain regions important for
auditory processing."

The burden of pediatric mental, neurological, and substance disorders in low-and middle-income countries
(LMICs) is tremendous. Although progress has been made over the past decade in applying task-shifting
approaches to scale evidence-based intervention (EBIs) in schools in LMICs, there is more to be learned about
the most effective and efficient ways to scale and sustain school-based EBIs in LMICs to support child mental
health, including both horizontal scale-up (processes for supporting and sustaining high-quality EBI
implementation in schools across regions and nationally) and vertical scale-up (processes for institutionalizing
and championing the EBI through policies and practices at all levels of the educational system). The
overarching goal of this project is to address these knowledge gaps by studying vertical and horizontal
strategies for scaling and sustaining one EBI to promote child mental health in Uganda. The EBI in this study is
ParentCorps-Professional Development (PD), a universal school-based preventive EBI that trains and supports
teachers to apply evidence-based strategies to promote children’s mental health, and to share prevention
knowledge and skills with parents. This task-shifting model of mental healthcare shifts activities from
professionals to teachers to promote children’s mental health. Effectiveness-implementation studies conducted
in Uganda and Nepal have demonstrated the effectiveness of task-shifting, with positive impacts on children,
teachers and schools. Results were similar when using a train-the-trainer model where ParentCorps-PD was
implemented by mental health professionals compared to when the PD was implemented by trained tutors
(non-mental health professionals) from Teacher-Training Colleges’ (TTCs). A combination of teacher task-
shifting and TTC train-the-trainer model offers a more scalable and sustainable approach for the educational
system in LMICs. The proposed study builds on this work and tests new horizontal and vertical scale-up
strategies to develop national and regional systems to support ParentCorps-PD implementation in Uganda.
The Specific Aims are to: 1) examine how a vertical scale-up strategy (leadership advocacy strategy) leads to
changes in policy, practice, or scale-up of EBIs; 2) support policy-research-practice partners (from Aim 1) to
make strategic choices and formalize implementation blueprints for scaling-up ParentCorps-PD; 3) examine
regional training-centers (TTC) and school PD implementation and practice outcomes when the new optimized
package of the ParentCorps-PD scale-up implementation blueprint (from Aim 2) is implemented; and 4)
explore the underlying scale-up and sustainability implementation mechanisms to inform the development of a
full high-quality scale-up implementation framework and processes relevant to low-resource and LMIC settings.

10996866,"Project Summary/Abstract
Thyroid eye disease (TED) is a debilitating orbital and ocular condition that affects up to 50% of patients with
Grave’s hyperthyroidism. Tissue fibrosis and hyaluronan overproduction in active TED leads to proptosis, eye
movement restriction, eyelid retraction, dry eye, and optic nerve compression. After 2-3 years, patients enter a
chronic phase of TED where symptoms persist but do not acutely worsen. The molecular basis of acute and
chronic TED is a mystery. Prior studies have found insulin like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) to be an
important cell surface protein in effecting the fibrosis and hyaluronan production of active TED. IGF-1R is
important in a variety of body processes from metabolism to cancer to TED and was found to be overexpressed
in TED orbital tissue. Exactly how IGF-1R effects the phenotypic changes in TED, and how the IGF-1R gene is
regulated is unknown. The utility of IGF-1R or other related targets in chronic TED is also not known. This study
examines the cell type landscape of acute and chronic TED and how IGF-1R is expressed and regulated in the
two phases of TED. Aim 1 will determine the cell type trophism of IGF-1R in acute and chronic TED compared
to un-diseased orbit tissue using single nuclei multiome sequencing of orbit tissue isolated from patients
undergoing surgery. Spatial transcriptomics will be used to distinguish microenvironments of isolated cell types
and interacting cell surface receptors. Aim 2 will investigate the regulation of IGF-1R expression by cis-regulatory
elements from single-nuclear Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC)-sequencing. Promising
targets will be tested through an in-vitro CRISPR-screen on human orbital fibroblasts from acute and chronic
TED patients to determine the effect on fibroblast proliferation of knocking down key regulatory regions. These
studies will generate a greater understanding of the cell type landscape of TED and how IGF-1R and other key
cell surface proteins are regulated in acute and chronic TED. The results could yield new therapeutic targets or
better understanding of how to use existing treatments most effectively. The proposed research training plan
features mentorship from the basic sciences and clinical sciences and access to state-of-the-art techniques and
facilities. This plan also incorporates professional development and unites collaborative resources between the
department of cellular and molecular medicine and the department of ophthalmology to maximize my training
potential."
10996942,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The ever-increasing incidence of obesity and type 2 diabetes has led to a concurrent increase in metabolic
associated liver diseases such as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and
metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). The presence of these diseases increases the risk of
progression to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, there are currently no FDA approved drugs
for the treatment of MASLD or MASH. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) has shown efficacy in reducing liver
fat and fibrosis in pre-clinical models, leading to the development of a promising class of long-lived FGF21
analogs as pharmaceutical treatments for MASH. Recently, our lab demonstrated that FGF21 reduces body
weight and increases energy expenditure via action in a genetically defined (Vglut2+) neuronal population. Our
new preliminary data suggests that FGF21’s effect on hepatic triglyceride levels and fibrosis, but not cholesterol
content, is also mediated through Vglut2+ neurons. Our central hypothesis is that FGF21 reverses MASH by
signaling to glutamatergic neurons to increase sympathetic nerve activity to the liver to lower hepatic steatosis
and fibrosis, and that FGF21 action on hepatocytes reduces hepatic cholesterol levels This proposal seeks to
determine the mechanisms by which FGF21 and its analogs reverse MASH by 1) determining the direct central
target of FGF21 that mediates the resolution of MASH, 2) determine how central versus hepatic FGF21 signaling
alone or in combination functions to reverse hepatic steatosis, and 3) determine the contribution and
mechanisms of FGF21-mediated changes in liver-innervating neurons to regulate liver function. Proposed
studies employ a suite of genetic mouse models to selective abolish or add-back β-klotho (the obligate co-
receptor for FGF21) from specific cell types with a physiologically relevant dietary MASH model to dissect the
contributions of Vglut2+ neurons and hepatocytes in the effects of FGF21. Together, these studies will determine
how FGF21 reverses MASH and may reveal novel pathways that could be selectively targeted for future
therapeutic strategies."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is projected to be the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the
US by 2030. With no cost-effective screening or prevention measures, most newly diagnosed pancreas cancer
patients present with locally advanced or metastatic disease, which carries a prognosis of less than one year.
PDA is classified into classical and basal subtypes, with basal portending a worse survival. In preliminary data,
we show that basal PDA is characterized by loss of the histone deacetylase sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) and inactivation of
the Integrated Stress Response (ISR), which renders tumor cells more sensitive to CDK7 targeted therapies.
SIRT6 has been recently shown to be a novel tumor suppressor in PDA, cooperating with oncogenic KRAS to
drive an even more aggressive PDA. However, elucidating SIRT6’s role in modulating the ISR remains to be
discovered. Here we propose three specific aims: (1) Identify how SIRT6 mechanistically affects ATF4 stability
(2) Characterize the in vivo efficacy of CDK7i in clinically relevant PDA mouse models; and (3) Determine how
DNp63 alters CDK7i sensitivity. This fellowship seeks support for the training of Dr. Adrianne Wallace-Povirk, a
postdoctoral fellow at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center (Fred Hutch), toward her goal of pursuing an academic
career in cancer research. To realize the scope of the proposed work, Dr. Wallace-Povirk will be sponsored by
Dr. Sita Kugel, whose laboratory focuses on epigenetic dysregulation in pancreas cancer, and will also
accelerate her research through collaborations with her co-mentor Dr. Andrew Hsieh (expert in translational
regulation), Dr. Eric Collisson (recognized leader in pancreas subtyping research), Dr. Sunil Hingorani (a
recognized leader in pancreas tumor biology and microenvironment), and Dr. Taran Gujral (expert in high-
throughput drug screening design). Dr. Wallace-Povirk will benefit from the breadth of expertise and highly
collaborative atmosphere at Fred Hutch, which houses leading research groups in pancreatic cancer and cancer
therapeutics."
10997671,"Project Summary/Abstract:
When an animal is hungry, it will undergo several behavioral adaptations, including increasing its
exploration of the environment. This adaptation of increased exploration is presumably critical for an
animal to increase its probability of rectifying its homeostatic imbalance and is an adaptation which is
altered in eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa. The neural process of sensing this internal state
disturbance is thought to be mediated by hypothalamic neurons while the process of changing exploratory
behavior is thought to be mediated by midbrain dopaminergic neurons that project to the striatum. These
hypothalamic neurons project disynaptically to midbrain dopaminergic neurons and are known to modulate
the response of these neurons to calorically rewarding substances, i.e., food. However, it is unknown how
the state of hunger exactly changes the exploratory behavior of an animal in response to non-calorically
rewarding substances, and whether these changes are mediated by connections between hypothalamic
neurons and midbrain dopaminergic neurons. I will examine and answer this gap in knowledge by studying
how caloric state and hypothalamic neurons modulates mouse exploratory behavior and midbrain
dopaminergic neural activity in the absence of food. I will focus on studying hypothalamic agouti-related
peptide (AgRP) neurons and midbrain dopaminergic neurons which release dopamine at the tail of the
striatum. To study this question, I will use freely-moving mouse behavioral assays with fiber photometry
and optogenetics/chemogenetics to monitor and perturb the neural activity of an animal, respectively.
First, I will study how caloric deprivation affects the exploratory behavior of hungry animals, and whether
these changes are mediated by differences in dopamine release at the tail of the striatum. Next, I will shift
my view upstream and investigate how AgRP neurons change the exploratory behavior of calorically
replete animals and whether these neurons modulate the activity of midbrain dopaminergic neurons that
project to the tail of striatum when an animal explores a non-obviously rewarding substance. If successful,
this project will elucidate the neural pathways by which hunger modulates the exploratory behavior of
animals and provide new understandings of the circuitry underlying an ethologically important behavior ."

Influenza A viruses (IAV) significantly burden society by causing millions of illnesses annually and generating
significant economic losses. Transmission of IAV between humans is thought to occur via virus-laden droplets
generated by infected individuals as they cough, sneeze, talk and breathe. IAV access the respiratory mucosa
of a new host by being delivered through direct contact, self-inoculation after touching surfaces containing viable
virus or through airborne transmission. The outcome of airborne transmission is dictated by the size of the
aerosols, which determines the duration for which they are suspended in air, how far they travel, and their site
of deposition in the respiratory tract. While direct, indirect, and airborne transmission are considered to contribute
to IAV spreading, their individual relevance is unclear. Moreover, whether the contribution of different mode(s)
of exposure changes with context, such as host immunity or environmental conditions, remains unknown. We
hypothesize that, in a recipient host, the efficiency of infection is modulated by the mode and
circumstances of exposure, which are defined by the site of viral deposition and effects of the
environment on host responses. To address this hypothesis, we will focus on the recipient host as this aspect
of transmission can be tightly manipulated experimentally. We will perform intranasal and aerosol inoculations
to model direct and airborne modes of infection in guinea pigs. To monitor the efficiency of infection, I will use
barcoded libraries of influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1pdm09) and A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2) viruses to
assess the number of unique viruses establishing infection. We predict that the viral barcodes will provide a
sensitive method for evaluating the intensity of exposure. Additionally, I will test varying ambient temperature
and relative humidity levels to assess the impact of environmental conditions on modes of exposure to IAV and
host immune responses. In Aim 1, I will examine the relationship between the intensity of exposure and
established barcode diversity given distinct modes of exposure. In Aim 2, I will assess the extent to which
environmental conditions impact host immune responses and the efficiency of IAV infection by different modes.
The impact of this research is to advance knowledge of external factors defining host susceptibility and IAV
infection and transmission potential. Our results will deepen understanding of the roles of different modes of
exposure in leading to infection and thereby enable development of effective interventions to limit IAV spread."

Treatment options for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) have been very limited. However, specific molecular
features such as high PD-L1 expression, elevated tumor mutational burden, and increased tumor infiltrating
lymphocytes in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) make TNBC an ideal candidate for immune
checkpoint blockade (ICB)-based therapy. Poor clinical response of TNBC to the ICB monotherapy necessitates
the identification of novel targets capable of enhancing the anti-tumor effects of immunotherapy. Effective
cytotoxic T cell (CTL)-mediated immune responses against cancer cells rely on adequate tumor antigen
presentation (AP). Insufficient tumor AP compromises the efficacy of ICB therapies, presenting a significant
obstacle in solid tumor immunotherapy. Enhancing surface MHC-I expression emerges as a plausible strategy
to potentiate ICB-based immunotherapy. Genetic alterations in the antigen processing and presentation (APP)
machinery or dysregulations in the intrinsic endolysosomal network are the main causes of diminished tumor
AP. While genetic alterations in the APP machinery have been extensively studied, factors regulating the
endolysosomal network in tumor AP remain underexplored. Our laboratory utilized the “Inference of Cell Types
and Deconvolution” algorithm and identified PIK3C2A as a promising druggable target in TNBC cells that
regulates phosphoinositide metabolism. Depletion of PIK3C2A in TNBC cells demonstrated significant
upregulation of tumor AP and enhanced cytotoxicity of specific CD8+ T cells. We hypothesize that inhibition of
PIK3C2A alters PI(3,4)P2 metabolism, resulting in dysfunctional endocytic vesicle formation, preventing the
internalization of the antigen:MHC-I complex, and thereby increasing the tumor AP. PIK3C2A is a dual-function
protein with both kinase and non-kinase activities. Its kinase activity regulates the endocytosis pathway through
PI(3,4)P2 generation around the neck of endocytic vesicles. Conversely, the non-kinase function of PIK3C2A
prevents chromosomal instability. Due to this dual functionality, the exact molecular mechanism contributing to
enhanced tumor AP remains unclear. The overall goal of this project is to characterize the function of PIK3C2A
in TNBC cells and its impact on the TNBC TIME. Aim 1 will elucidate the mechanism underpinning enhanced
tumor AP upon PIK3C2A depletion in TNBC cells through transcriptomic profiling, PI(3,4)P2 quantification, and
examining the Ova/MHC-I turnover rate in vitro. In Aim 2, we will use a PIK3C2A isoform-selective inhibitor
(PITCOIN1) and anti-PD-1 combination to treat orthotopic TNBC tumors in syngeneic mouse model as a proof-
of-concept study to determine whether this combination therapy inflames the TIME and promotes potent tumor
regression in vivo. This project aligns with my training as a future physician-scientist, whose research goal is to
focus on the discovery and development of solid tumor immunotherapy."

Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled RNA Mediated Regulation of Immunity:
Mechanism, Disease and Therapeutics, organized by Drs. Uttiya Basu, Sun Hur and Noam Stern-Ginossar. The
conference will be held in Keystone, Colorado from January 27–31, 2025.
Noncoding RNAs, the RNA epigenome, and RNA processing mechanisms have recently emerged as systems
at the forefront of gene expression control, particularly in the context of molecular immunology. In immune cells,
these RNA-based mechanisms influence gene expression programs, signaling pathway activation and cellular
activation states that have direct influence on immune system function and dysfunction. This Keystone Symposia
conference defines a new intersection of RNA biology with immunology by bringing together a diverse group of
immunologists, molecular biologists, RNA biochemists, and system biologists to discuss and advance research
at the intersection of RNA, epigenetics and immunity. As the first conference of its kind, the program will focus
on newly identified connections of these fields, convening scientists working on noncoding RNA, RNA sensors,
and RNA ‘epitranscriptomics’ with leading immunologists. This breadth of topics illustrates the emerging interest
and the dynamic nature of the field, which spans basic immunological questions to applied and translational
research. As the recent pandemic has highlighted, RNA is a central element of immune system development,
pathophysiology in viral disease and also in the leading edge of therapeutics. Thus, it is anticipated that the
program’s diverse representation of speakers and attendees across academic, clinical, biotech and
pharmaceutical sectors will feature leading basic research in the field but also reveal opportunities for therapeutic
applications. Finally, because this conference is being held jointly with the Keystone Symposium on Non-coding
RNA Biology: New Roles & Diversity, we expect further cross-disciplinary insights and new collaborations to
advance mechanistic discoveries and explore the potential impacts of ncRNA on immune system function."

Malignant gliomas are the most common primary adult brain cancer, affecting over 20,000 Americans each year.
While molecularly targeted therapies have demonstrated tremendous successes in other malignancies, there is
a lack of effective and personalized therapeutic approaches for these deadly brain cancers. The goal of this
study is to investigate the complex phenomena of phenotypic plasticity in glioblastoma (GBM), the most lethal of
all brain tumors in adults, in driving resistance to targeted therapies via non-genetic mechanisms facilitated by
the unique brain microenvironment. Extensive preliminary data, which incorporate a large cohort of genetically
diverse preclinical glioma models and drugs in clinical development for GBM, indicate the oncogene epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) maintains a radial glia (RG)-like cell state in GBM, which drives glioma initiation,
heterogeneity, and plasticity. Moreover, preliminary data demonstrate pharmacologic ablation of EGFR induces
lineage reprogramming from RG-like to neural/oligodendrocyte progenitor (NPC/OPC)-like programs uniquely in
the brain microenvironment, which is hypothesized to drive rapid adaptation and resistance to EGFR-targeted
therapy. Specific Aim 1 utilizes cutting-edge single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) combined with an
innovative genetic fluorescent reporter system and high-resolution barcoded lineage tracing to elucidate the
evolutionary mechanisms driving lineage transformations following targeted therapy in GBM. Through the use of
state-of-the-art preclinical models that capture the unique brain microenvironment, this approach is expected to
provide unprecedented insights into the influence of the brain environment in driving cellular dynamics and
lineage transformations during response to therapeutic interventions. Specific Aim 2 focuses on defining the
signaling pathways that facilitate brain microenvironment-dependent lineage transitions that drive resistance to
oncogene ablation in GBM. Using novel, clinical stage molecularly targeted therapeutics and innovative in vitro
models of the brain microenvironment, this aim will uncover the pivotal signaling pathways and brain-derived
factors that drive lineage transitions and contribute to resistance against EGFR-targeted therapies in malignant
gliomas. Overall, this project represents a significant step towards a deeper understanding of the molecular and
cellular mechanisms underpinning tumor heterogeneity and therapy resistance in GBM. By elucidating the
dynamics of cellular state transitions and the role of the brain microenvironment in these processes, this work
has the potential to significantly impact the development of more effective, targeted treatment strategies for
patients suffering from this devastating disease."
10998118,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The centromere is a key region of the chromosome that mediates kinetochore assembly and spindle attachment,
thus ensuring proper chromosomal segregation. Compromised centromere integrity results in increased risk of
chromosomal rearrangements and mis-segregation, which can lead to chromosomal instability (CIN) and large-
scale genetic changes, characteristics commonly observed in cancer cells. One of the major threats to DNA
integrity and genome stability is oxidative damage arising from the exposure to reactive oxygen species (ROS),
known as oxidative stress (OS). Chronic exposure to OS is associated with centromeric dysfunction and
increased centromere instability, yet the impact of OS specifically at the centromere is unclear. To investigate
the DNA damage response at the centromere, our lab is using a specialized chemoptogenetic system designed
to generate the common OS induced lesion 8-oxoguanine locally at centromeric DNA. This lesion occurs
hundreds of times per day in a cell and is repaired through the Base Excision Repair (BER) pathway. My
preliminary studies revealed immediate BER factor recruitment as well as shifts in the cell cycle and a large
decrease in active DNA synthesis following OS at the centromere. In addition, I observed formation of DNA
breaks and an increase in apoptosis 24h after treatment. Finally, RNA sequencing revealed changes in genes
mapping to replication stress signaling and DNA damage repair. Based off these preliminary findings, I
hypothesize that OS at the centromere leads to replication stress and increased CIN. In Aim 1, I will
investigate the DNA damage response at the centromere and the contribution of DNA repair factors in
maintenance of centromere integrity. In Aim 2, I will assess the impact of centromeric damage on chromosome
segregation and DNA replication dynamics. These experiments will uncover the factors involved in mitigating the
impact of OS and maintaining integrity at centromeres. The results will provide insight into how centromere
dysfunction and subsequent CIN arise, helping further our knowledge of CIN associated cancers and informing
potential therapeutic targets."

Familial dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a heritable disorder characterized by progressive enlargement of the
heart’s ventricles and impaired contraction, leading to early-onset heart failure and heart transplantation at a
young age. A significant subset of inherited DCM cases is attributed to mutations in an 18-bp segment of the
arginine-/serine-rich (RS) domain of the RNA binding motif protein 20 (RBM20) gene. These mutations lead to
aberrant splicing of cardiac genes critical to contractility and calcium signaling, causing deterioration of cardiac
function. Approved medical treatments offer symptomatic relief, but there remains an unmet need for CRISPR
gene editing therapies that correct the genetic causes of RBM20-induced DCM to halt disease progression.
This project seeks to develop a gene editing strategy that replaces the entire 18-bp RBM20 pathogenic cluster
with a synonymous DNA sequence (i.e., rewriting) to offer a universal treatment for all RBM20-DCM patients
with RS-domain mutations. This approach is conceivable with prime editing (PE) – which uses an RNA-guided
Cas9 nickase fused to reverse transcriptase (RT) to mediate base substitutions, genomic insertions, or deletions.
PE-mediated base substitution corrected an RBM20 mutation to reverse phenotypes in DCM cells, but targeted
DNA insertion by PE to rewrite the RBM20 pathogenic cluster has not been tested. The ideal PE platform for
RBM20-DCM will maximize DNA insertion efficiency in cardiomyocytes (CMs) while minimizing genotoxicity.
Aim 1 will establish the efficiency of a PE method for rewriting the RBM20 pathogenic cluster. Canonical PE
effectively inserts small sequences (<10 bp) in cells, including CMs, but efficiency of larger DNA insertion is low.
Recent work has developed a template-jumping (TJ) PE method, which mimics the genomic insertion
mechanism of retrotransposons to achieve efficient large DNA insertion in cells. This aim will measure the
efficiency of targeted DNA insertion by TJ-PE (vs. canonical PE) to rewrite the 18-bp RBM20 cluster in RBM20-
HEK293T cells and isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs) expressing nine distinct RBM20 cluster
variants. Edited and unedited iPSCs will be differentiated into CMs to characterize the molecular consequences
of each pathogenic variant and the extent to which TJ-PE-mediated rewriting reverses these defects. Aim 2 will
investigate the toxicity of genomic editing in CMs. The RT domain of PE bears inherent risks of genotoxicity and
a low affinity for dNTP substrates, a critical consideration in CMs due to their limited regenerative capacity and
low dNTP environment. Recent work has developed a template-jumping DNA polymerase prime editor (DPE)
with a higher affinity for dNTPs and may or may not be less genotoxic than RT. This aim will test the RBM20
cluster rewriting efficiency of TJ DPE (vs TJ PE) in RBM20-HEK293T reporter lines, isogenic iPSCs, and
differentiated CMs. Following delivery to CMs, genotoxicity and phenotypic changes will also be determined.
This work will inform the development of an efficient, safe PE platform to treat genetically diverse cases of
RBM20-DCM and provide the fellow with training in therapeutic gene editing and genetic cardiac disease biology."

Traditional medicines relies on plants and fungi to provide treatments for various diseases. These treatments
have withstood the test of time with active ingredients that are natural products, compounds generated by these
organisms. Natural products are a successful source of inspiration for medicines and therapeutics today.
However, due to the complex structures of many natural products, synthetic routes toward these compounds are
often long and difficult. Thus, there is a need for new approaches to enable the synthesis of these compounds
in an efficient and high throughput manner to be able to test their viability as therapeutics. One natural product
class that has promise as therapeutics, but has little research due to the difficulty of synthesis, are azaphilone
natural products. Azaphilones have been used in China for over 1000 years in a health food remedy call “red
mold rice”. These molecules have shown antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, cholesterol
synthesis inhibition, and cytotoxic activity. Azaphilones are a large, structurally diverse class of natural products.
Development of a high throughput, efficient route to a large variety of azaphilones would enable access to
potentially life-saving therapeutics. Two subclasses that are prevalent in this natural product family are dimerized
and reduced azaphilones. I aim to use biocatalysis to synthesize these two subclasses of azaphilones in a high
throughput manner using P450 enzymes and reductase enzymes. Once these natural products are synthesized,
in combination with azaphilones I have previously made, I aim to investigate the biological activity using a
fluorescence polarization assay exploring azaphilone effects on protein-protein interactions. This will impact the
development of novel medicine alternatives for treating major human health concerns such as viral infections,
bacterial infections, fungal infections, high cholesterol, and cancer."

10999991,"Occipital strokes cause permanent damage to primary visual cortex (V1), the gateway for visual information
processing in humans. Such patients lose conscious vision in the contralateral visual field, termed cortically-
induced blindness (CB), although unconscious visual processing sometimes remains in the blind field, known as
blindsight. Importantly, visual discrimination training with moving stimuli placed just inside the blind-field border
can restore some conscious vision in CB patients. However, overall visual capacities in the blind field remain
highly impaired, making daily activities like reading and driving difficult or impossible. A number of neuronal
pathways linking the visual thalamus (dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, LGN) with extrastriate cortex directly, or
indirectly through residual portions of V1, have been proposed to underlie blindsight and training-induced vision
recovery, respectively. However, no direct measures of changes in the neurons and circuits connecting LGN,
perilesional V1, and extrastriate cortex have ever been made after V1 lesions, especially simultaneously, and
such invasive measures are not possible in humans. Here, we aim to fill this substantial gap by characterizing
neuronal and circuit adaptations post-V1 lesions in a novel animal model of CB (Aim 1). We will then uncover
reconfigurations that occur in these neurons and circuits following training optimized to attain vision restoration
(Aims 2-4). Our overarching goals are to provide a mechanistic explanation for both blindsight and training-
induced vision recovery, and to provide a foundation for improving current vision restoration therapies throughout
the blind field. We will develop a CB model in ferrets, highly visual carnivores with early visual parallel processing
streams and motion-selective extrastriate cortical areas homologous to those in primates. Ferrets have a large
binocular visual field, unlike rodents, and can be trained to perform complex visual discrimination tasks, like
humans and primates. Yet larger cohorts of ferrets can be tested and trained across a battery of stimulus para-
digms than is possible in primates. Ibotenic acid lesions of V1 will be made to create vision loss in the central
~50˚. Multi-electrode arrays will be inserted simultaneously into 3 critical nodes in the residual visual system:
LGN, perilesional V1, and the motion-selective postero-medial lateral suprasylvian (PMLS) area to test how
direct LGN-PMLS and indirect LGN-perilesional V1-PMLS circuits are modified post-lesion (Aim 1). Separate
cohorts of V1-lesioned ferrets will then be trained on custom regimes (Aim 2) inspired by neuronal response
properties measured in Aim 1. This will allow assessment of neurophysiological adaptations induced by optimal
training paradigms (Aim 3). Finally, retrograde tracing and neurochemistry will be used to determine the contri-
butions of distinct cell types and neuronal circuits to passive plasticity (Aim 1) versus training-induced vision
recovery (Aim 4). Together, these results will provide the most comprehensive picture yet of the neuronal mech-
anisms engaged by V1 lesions, and how these differ between blindsight and training-induced visual recovery.
This creates a critical scientific platform for future optimization of vision restoration in human CB patients."

The nucleus acccumbens (NAC) and amygdala are key hubs in this network, and these regions play an
important role in integrating the effects of stress on motivated behavior. The neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R) is
the high affinity endogenous target of the neuropeptide substance P, and the NK1R is expressed throughout
the extended amygdala, especially in the NAC and amygdala. The SP/NK1R system has been shown to
influence neurophysiological and behavioral responses to stress and drugs of abuse. During the current
funding period, we have identified a role of the NK1R in the NAC shell in the behavioral phenotypes and
escalated alcohol consumption that are induced by the major stressor of social defeat stress (SDS). We have
found that SP expressing projections to the NAC shell from the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) are activated
during SDS exposure. Interestingly, we have also observed significant SP-expressing projections from the
PVT to the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). Much of our prior work has focused on these two regions,
the NAC shell and the CeA, in NK1R effects on escalated alcohol consumption and stress-induced alcohol
seeking. In this renewal application, we will examine the characteristics of the PVT SP+ projections to the CeA
and NAC shell, determining how these neurons are organized anatomically and the behavioral roles played by
these discrete circuits. Additionally, we will use in vivo fiber photometry to examine the patterns of activation in
these specific circuits during alcohol consumption. Finally, since chronic alcohol exposure induces
neuroadaptations in stress-sensitive neurons, we will use translating ribosome affinity purification to isolate
mRNA transcripts that are actively translating in SP cells and will assess cell type specific alterations in PVT
gene expression following chronic alcohol exposure, determining in which SP-expressing pathways the
identified genes of interest are expressed. This will also allow for a detailed assessment of transcriptional
changes in these cells following chronic alcohol exposure, and will enable the detection of potential sex
differences. Overall, these experiments will provide valuable information on the circuit and gene expression
changes that mediate the response to alcohol, and will identify targets for the development of novel treatment
strategies."

Hair-greying is an early and visible sign of aging with important psychosocial, commercial, and biologic
implications. The underlying mechanisms of hair-greying are not well-understood, but the anti-apoptotic BCL2
gene is thought to play a key role in this process.
Recent and unpublished studies from our group reveal that the “glacier” bear, a rare color variant of the
American black bear found in Southeast Alaska, is a natural model of hair greying that is likely caused by a
BCL2 mutation. Glacier bears exhibit variable degrees of hair-greying that occasionally spares the facial region
and distal limbs, and is histologically similar to human hair-greying. Genomic studies and genetic association
analysis have identified a single region on what corresponds to human chromosome 18 that contains 3 genes,
including BCL2. There are no protein-coding alterations in any of the 3 genes but there are 562 non-coding
variants within the candidate region, many of which lie in cis-regulatory elements (CREs).
In laboratory mice, loss-of-function for Bcl2 has pleiotropic consequences including small size, disruption of
kidney and lymphoid development, and postnatal lethality. These abnormalities have not been described in
glacier bears, leading us to hypothesize that the cause of hair-greying is disruption of a melanocyte-specific
regulatory element. To better understand the pathophysiology of hair-greying and regulation of BCL2, we will:
(1) Carry out additional genetic and histologic studies of glacier bear DNA and skin; and
(2) Apply a massively parallel reporter assay in three human cell lines to identify CREs for BCL2 and to identify
causative variants for the glacier bear mutation."

Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is a common rehabilitation technology that incorporates electrical
stimulation timed with a functional task to augment paretic muscle function in people with neuro-pathologies
such as stroke and spinal cord injury. The rigor of previous research has established transcutaneous and
implanted FES systems for standing, walking, reaching and grasping, with both neuro-prosthetic and
therapeutic effects. Stroke is the leading cause of disability. Footdrop is a highly prevalent post-stroke gait
deficit, leading to insufficient ankle dorsiflexion during the swing phase of gait, and contributing to reduced
mobility. FES systems that compensate for footdrop to improve gait function and reduce falls risk are gaining
increasing popularity, with commercial FES footdrop systems now available for clinical use. Despite their
promising functional value, accessibility, and positive neuroplasticity effects, current FES systems have some
fundamental limitations, which limit their clinical prescription. The overall goal of this R21 is to overcome 2
major limitations and technical gaps in FES – rapid onset of muscle fatigue and lack of closed-loop control of
FES intensity. Most existing FES systems do not automatically modulate stimulation intensity in response to
muscle fatigue, and may overstimulate the muscles. To address this limitation, this R21 facilitates a novel inter-
institutional cross-disciplinary collaboration between scientists with complimentary expertise in clinical testing
of FES for improving stroke gait (MPI Kesar) and engineering of data-driven FES control systems (MPI
Sharma). We propose the first clinical testing of a new bioinspired FES controls approach developed by MPI
Sharma that exploits fatigue predictions from a model-predictive controller (MPC) to control FES intensity,
avoid overstimulation, delay fatigue, and maximize FES-induced gait performance. For the first time, we will
systematically test FES controllers that incorporate MPI Sharma’s data-driven MPC muscle and fatigue
behavior model in people with post-stroke hemiparesis, so that FES parameters can be computed optimally
and proactively, via prediction (feedforward FES control), in addition to reacting to changes in ongoing gait
performance (feedback FES control). For this MPC-based FES controller, we propose to use ultrasound to
inform the model about fatigue onset, which is unprecedented in FES for stroke gait. Our project aims are to
(1) develop and evaluate a novel data-driven, model predictive FES controller that utilizes ultrasound-
derived feedback for footdrop correction during post-stroke gait; and 2) compare our novel FES
control system with conventional FES during treadmill and overground gait in people post-stroke. This
work will inform future clinical testing and development. Our immediate deliverable will be a leading-edge FES
neuro-prosthetic technology that uses ultrasound-sensing and MPC closed-loop optimization of FES
stimulation to improve mobility in people post-stroke. The sustained impact will be development of FES
systems that enable fatigue resistant mobility in people post-stroke and other neuro-pathologies."

T cells play a pivotal role in various neurological disorders, and their involvement is a critical aspect of the
immune response within the central nervous system. Despite the significance of T cells in neuroinflammation
and neurodegenerative processes, the identification of T cell targets in these contexts remain challenging. In
recent years, advancements in basic and clinical neuroimmunology have improved our comprehension of T
cell pathophysiology in neurological disorders. However, research efforts often exist in isolation, lacking a
unified platform for meaningful collaboration between basic immunologists, neuropathologists, T cell
engineers, computational biologists and clinicians. To address this gap, “T Cells in the Brain 2025
(TCB2025): Decoding T Cell Targets in Neurodegenerative Diseases” aims to consolidate recent
scientific progress and integrative approaches towards T cell-related therapy. This conference will bring
together experts in the field to share cutting-edge insights and foster interdisciplinary discussions that can
catalyze the development of therapeutic interventions targeting T cells in neurodegenerative diseases.
Recognizing the importance of diversity in scientific research, TCB is committed to enhancing inclusivity by
actively encouraging the participation of young investigators, women, and underrepresented minority (URM)
researchers. By providing a platform for collaborative discourse, TCB aspires to accelerate the development
of effective T cell-based therapies for neurodegenerative disorders."

This proposal requests sponsorship for the 48th U.S. Ten-Day Seminar. Given the burden of cardiovascular
diseases (CVD) and stroke, it is highly appropriate to conduct professional training on epidemiology and
prevention. The goals of this proposal align with the NHLBI’s Strategic Vision which seeks to “further develop,
diversify, and sustain a scientific workforce capable of accomplishing the NHLBI’s mission.” Training of such a
workforce is a key element of the country’s readiness to address the health challenges posed by CVD and the
readiness to advance multi-component strategies that promote cardiovascular health (CVH). A prepared
workforce will need research competencies in epidemiology and biostatistics, quality of care, and policy and
environmental approaches to health promotion and disease prevention. Further, authoritative health agencies
and prominent scientists have noted an increasing need for professionals who understand methods related to
e-cohorts, large practical clinical trials, dissemination and implementation research, and big data analytics.
Scientists will also need expertise in cost-effectiveness research, epigenetics, and biomedical informatics.
This Seminar can uniquely contribute to training scientists who can integrate evidence across these fields and
translate research findings into effective and impactful policy and practice. We seek primary sponsorship from
the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and if we receive a meritorious score we will request co-
funding from NIDDK, NINDS, the NIH Office of Disease Prevention, and the NIH Office of Behavioral and
Social Sciences Research. Other funders/partners for the Seminar are the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (grant), and the American Heart Association (council budgets and in-kind).
To assure the successful conduct of the Seminar, we will continue to:
1. Attract a faculty with both the knowledge of relevant content and the personal teaching skills required for
 the effective conduct of this program, with a continuing emphasis on the recruitment of faculty from
 underrepresented racial/ethnic groups (currently 31% of the faculty) and female faculty members
 (currently 56% of the faculty);
2. Adapt program content to maintain its relevance to the training needs of the nation for health professionals
 with appropriate career interests, while maintaining a consistent central focus on the foundational methods
 in cardiovascular disease epidemiology;
3. Disseminate information about this program to appropriate groups, using the most effective current
 strategies for reaching underrepresented racial/ethnic groups, female candidates and historically
 marginalized groups; and
4. Recruit participants from populations that have been historically marginalized by connecting with diverse
 professional societies and organizations, and sustained relationships with seminar alumni."

This award will allow Dr Clifford George Banda to characterise the pharmacokinetic and
safety profiles of two long-acting artemisinin partner drugs, lumefantrine and amodiaquine
and their active metabolites when administered as artemether-lumefantrine plus
amodiaquine (ALAQ) in African young children with uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition
as well as adults living with HIV and on dolutegravir-based antiretroviral therapy. Dr Banda,
Malawi’s first medical specialist in Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, will further his
career development by;1) gaining skills in early phase clinical trial design and conduct in
complex subpopulations; 2) consolidating skills in clinical translation of quantitative
pharmacology (population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling) to inform dose
optimisation of antimalarials in the two key target subgroups of children with severe acute
malnutrition and adults living with HIV; and 3) strengthening his clinical and research
leadership skills to allow transition into research career independence. In the proposed
project work,he hypothesises that severe acute malnutrition is associated with reduced
absorption and subsequent bioavailability of lumefantrine, amodiaquine and their active
metabolites. Consequently, the attained concentrations would be insufficient to treat and
prevent malaria recurrence. He will study the effect of uncomplicated severe acute
malnutrition on lumefantrine and amodiaquine exposure. Furthermore, there are concerns
about a potential reduction of dolutegravir exposure when amodiaquine is co-administered
with dolutegravir-based antiretroviral therapy, Dr Banda will characterise the effect of ALAQ
on dolutegravir overall exposure in adults living with HIV. This evidence is needed to inform
the optimal dosing of the promising triple antimalarial combination, ALAQ, in these two
subpopulations. It would support the World Health Organisation’s strategy for responding to
antimalarial resistance in Africa by identifying innovative ways to combine and repurpose
existing antimalarial therapies as a tool to delay antimalarial resistance while awaiting the
development and licensing of novel non-artemisinin-based combination therapies."

Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a heterogeneous group of tumors with increasing incidence, which are hard
to identify in the early stage and repeatedly misdiagnosed, yielding 20%-50% of patients with distant metastases
at initial diagnosis. Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common solid-organ malignancy in men in the United
States. Distinguishing indolent from aggressive PCa and differentiation of localized disease and metastatic
spread are essential for PCa treatment selection. For both NETs and PCa, disease-specific overexpression
exists in cancer cells. 68Ga-DOTATATE and 68Ga-PSMA-11, the two most widely used Gallium-68 PET tracers,
can target the overexpression in cancer cells of NETs and PCa, respectively. They are essential imaging
techniques for NETs and PCa management, given their high sensitivity and specificity in detecting primary tumor
and metastatic spread. Due to the shorter half-life and larger positron range of Gallium 68 and the lower injection
dose limited by generator capacity, Gallium-68 PET has a lower image quality compared with 18F-FDG PET,
which significantly compromises its lesion detectability and quantification accuracy. As Gallium-68 PET is
increasingly adopted in clinics, there are unmet needs to further optimize it for better disease management. The
goal of this project is to improve Gallium 68-based PET image quality through deep learning (DL)-based motion
correction, image reconstruction, and kinetic modeling. Aim 1 of this project is to develop a data-driven
respiratory motion-correction framework with phase-matched attenuation correction. Aim 2 of this project is to
develop a DL-based image reconstruction method to improve static Gallium 68-based PET imaging. Aim 3 of
this project is to further develop DL-based kinetic-modeling methods to improve dynamic Gallium 68-based PET
imaging. Aim 4 of this study is to perform comprehensive clinical evaluations of the developed methods. We
expect that the integrated outcome of the four aims will be novel, effective, and robust motion correction and
reconstruction methods for Gallium-68 PET that can improve its lesion detectability and quantification accuracy."

Peri-transplantation inflammation of solid organ allografts exacerbates acute cell-mediated rejection and
increases late graft loss, primarily caused by chronic rejection. The two most common causes of perioperative
inflammation are ischemia reperfusion injury and, in sensitized recipients, pre-formed donor specific
antibodies, both of which deposit antibody and complement membrane attack complexes (MACs) on graft
endothelial cells (ECs). MAC deposition leads to increased T cell-mediated rejection by inducing expression of
surface proteins on the EC surface that intensify host T cell responses. Two such proteins are ICOS-L (which
in humans engages T cell CD28) and IL-15/IL-15R (which engages T cell IL-2Rc). We hypothesize that
preventing surface expression of these molecules on graft of ECs—i.e “ treating the graft rather than the
recipient”—will reduce early T cell-mediated rejection episodes and late term graft loss and thereby allow
reductions in systemic immunosuppression. In aim 1, we will develop and optimize new antibody-targeted,
degradable solid polyamine co-ester (PACE) nanoparticles (NPs) that can be administered during ex vivo
normothermic machine perfusion and deliver therapeutic siRNAs selectively to ECs that we have shown can
prevent these molecules from being expressed. Solid NPs can slowly release the siRNAs and we will evaluate
efficacy and duration of effects in both cultured cells and perfused human vessel segments. We will then use
these model systems to evaluate changes in allogeneic T cell responses in vitro and, in the case of arteries, in
vivo transplant into human immune system mice. In Aim 2, we will develop antibody-targeted liquid PACE NPs
(polyplexes) to deliver mRNAs encoding Cas enzymes and guide strands that can produce permanent gene
disruption or epigenetic silencing and test these in the same model systems. In Aim 3, we will further develop
approaches to optimize delivery of the antibody-targeted NPs to ECs of human kidneys and hearts that have
been declined for transplantation using established methods of ex vivo normothermic machine perfusion.
These experiments will exploit advances already made by our team, such as fibrinolytic clearing of
fibrinogen/erythrocyte occlusions of graft vasculature to increase access to the whole vasculature and
improved coupling of targeting antibodies using monobody adapters that greatly enhance binding to ECs.
Additionally, we will develop a mouse model of transplant to allow testing of efficacy vs. a fully replete immune
system. The technologies developed in all three aims can be readily adapted for use against other EC targets."

The superior olivary complex (SOC) in the brainstem of mammals integrates information from the two ears
enabling sound localization. This ability underlies selective auditory attention and is disrupted by hearing loss and
in children with central auditory processing disorder (CAPD). Principal neurons of lateral superior olive (LSO
PNs) are critical for these functions. The classical view of the LSO is a homogeneous block of cells that extracts
ongoing interaural level differences (ILDs), however, it is increasingly implicated in encoding interaural time
differences (ITDs) for broadband transients and amplitude modulations. Cellular properties are fundamental to
how neurons extract and encode information. ILD/ITD processing places disparate demands on neuronal
properties and there is cellular diversity in the LSO that is not well-understood. It is also critical to understand how
different types of information may be organized in higher processing centers such as the inferior colliculus (IC).
Our overarching hypothesis is that LSO PN cellular diversity supports both ILD and ITD coding and
neurotransmitter system, intrinsic excitability, and projection pattern provide means to organize differentially
extracted information in the IC.
 We found that LSO PNs consist of inhibitory and excitatory cell types with different projection patterns,
intrinsic membrane properties, and morphology. Aim 1 will begin to address what produces these differences,
how they relate to ILD/ITD extraction, and how conductive hearing loss (CHL) affects them using the mouse
model. To do this we will compare LSO PN types at the level of gene expression using PatchSeq and
electrophysiologically using computational modelling, ex vivo patch-clamp, and in vivo intracellular technique.
Aim 2 will further probe the functional implications of our preliminary findings by examining the synaptic drive onto
these cells with the goal of finding input-output relationships that support different sound localization coding
strategies. These data and Aim 1 findings will be used to update computational models of LSO neurons used to
test ILD/ITD functions. We will also use bilateral electrical synaptic stimulation to examine how cell types
transform inputs. Signal propagation in dendrites is a critical parameter of integrative functions. Very little is
known about dendritic processing in LSO neurons. Aim 3 will begin to address this gap in our knowledge and
help us understand what dendritic properties facilitate diverse ILD/ITD coding strategies using dual somatic-
dendritic recordings and two-photon calcium imaging.
 These aims are conceptually innovative in their treatment of the LSO as a diverse group with cellular
properties tuned for multiple functional roles and methodologically innovative in our use of transcriptomics and
computational models to target ex vivo and in vivo electrophysiological studies. This project will yield foundational
insights into the cellular organization of the SOC which may be disrupted by hearing loss and contribute to poorly
understood disease states such as CAPD."

 Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is polygenic condition in which the fetal intestines and liver
herniate into the thoracic cavity, resulting in lung compression and impaired pulmonary development. Despite
being one of the most common and expensive surgical birth defects managed in neonatal intensive care units
worldwide, the underlying biomolecular mechanisms of CDH lung hypoplasia remain unknown. Advances in
state-of-the-art surgical critical care, including novel pharmacologic agents, extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation, and fetal surgery have failed to make a substantial impact in improving clinical outcomes in severely
affected children, with overall mortality remaining at 30%, largely due to the devastating degree of lung pathology.
There remains a critical need to better understand the mechanisms underlying CDH lung hypoplasia to offer
hope for affected patients and their families. YAP/TAZ is the core kinase of the Hippo signaling pathway that has
been shown to respond to mechanosensory stimuli during fetal lung patterning and differentiation. The proximal-
distal fetal lung abnormalities observed with the human CDH phenotype are consistent with those of YAP/TAZ
dysregulation in the setting of mechanical compression (reduced intrapulmonary pressures). Although
transpulmonary pressures have also been shown to regulate FGF10, an essential growth factor and major
downstream regulator of branching morphogenesis and epithelial differentiation, the interplay between the
YAP/TAZ translocation and FGF10-mediated lung growth in CDH is not well understood. The central hypothesis
of this proposal is that reduced nuclear YAP/TAZ activation during the canalicular stage of lung development
results in profound lung hypoplasia in CDH. Four research teams, led by Shaun Kunisaki (surgery), Jason
Spence (cell biology), Celeste Nelson (engineering), and Enid Neptune (pulmonary), will bring together
complementary backgrounds and technologies to address this hypothesis. Using the established nitrofen mouse
model, human lung organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, and high throughput micro-
mechanical compression devices, three distinct aims are proposed. In Specific Aim 1, they will investigate the
impact of nuclear YAP/TAZ regulation during CDH canalicular lung development. In Specific Aim 2, they will
determine whether mechanical forces modulate CDH fetal lung morphogenesis ex vivo through YAP/TAZ
signaling. In Specific Aim 3, they will evaluate how nuclear YAP/TAZ activation affects in vivo lung growth in a
large animal fetal model of CDH. Completion of these Aims will have facilitated a better understanding of the role
of an important mechanosensing pathway during CDH lung development and will have potentially uncovered
new therapeutic targets for affected children at the more severe end of the CDH disease spectrum."

In response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) NOT-ES-23-002, our research addresses the urgent
concern of escalating plastic pollution. Despite numerous reports indicating the ubiquitous presence of plastics
in the environment and growing global concern for ecosystems and human health, plastic production and use
continue to grow unabatedly. Humans are exposed to plastic particles mainly through ingestion of
contaminated food or water, through inhalation, or through skin contact. Humans consume up to 5g (weight of
a credit card) microplastics weekly, and colonic epithelial cells will face the brunt of this toxic exposure. Recent
studies provide evidence for the accumulation of microplastics in multiple human organs including the colon.
Toxic exposure to microplastics has been linked to the disruption of colonic epithelial cell structure and
function. Moreover, studies in different preclinical models including mice indicate that microplastics exposure
leads to various adverse intestinal effects including inflammation, barrier dysfunction, and microbial imbalance.
Long-standing intestinal inflammation and oxidative stress increase the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC)
development. However, to date, there have been no studies investigating the influence of microplastics on
colon tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Thus, investigation into the potential association between the
environmental microplastics exposure and the risk of CRC is merited. Our objective is to unveil the molecular
mechanisms linking microplastics exposure to CRC. We hypothesize that microplastics trigger PIEZO1-
dependent oxidative stress and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-3α signaling, promoting CRC progression. Our
hypothesis is based on our data showing that different microplastics consistently and dramatically promote
oxidative stress in a mechanosensing ion channel PIEZO1 dependent manner. Moreover, microplastics
activate HIF-3α signaling, which drives growth, migration, and metastasis of colon tumors in preclinical models.
The proposal highlights the unique PIEZO1 trigger (Aim 1) and the immediate downstream HIF-3α signaling
(Aim 2) of oxidative stress, integrating human relevance through archived colon tissues from New Mexico's
diverse and underprivileged population, as well as human colonoids (both normal and tumor, Aim 3). These
goals aim to enhance our comprehension of the fundamental mechanisms underlying microplastics' toxicity
and identify actionable elements for community-level disease prevention and treatment."

Secreted proteins coordinate organ functions during homeostasis. The secreted proteome represents a poorly-
characterized interorgan communication network, which is central in the etiology of various metabolic disor-
ders. For example, obesity affects 40% of the US population, and the metabolic complications of obesity may
result from dysfunctional interorgan communication. Despite this, the composition and activity of interorgan
communication networks and their impact on obesity remain poorly defined. White adipose tissue (WAT) plays
a central role in energy sensing and storage, and coordination of activities across organs to regulate systemic
metabolism. In turn, energy storage in WAT is affected by the intestine in response to dietary and internal met-
abolic inputs. Obesity disrupts this normal interorgan network and impacts metabolism of visceral and subcu-
taneous WAT depots. We therefore anticipate that defining proteins secreted from intestine to the WAT depots
will discover novel factors that regulate obesity. However, it has historically been difficult to identify such se-
creted proteins due to their low abundance and lack of information on their organ(s) of origin. To address this,
we established in mice a conditional BirA*G3 engineered biotin ligase system that generally labels secreted
proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum of one organ, allowing identification of proteins that traffic to distal
organs using affinity enrichment and quantitative mass spectrometry. This transgenic system can be ex-
pressed in specific organs (e.g., intestine) to identify key secreted factors that communicate to distal organs,
and provide clues to the labeled secreted factors’ underlying biology based on the organ-of-origin, the
destination, and their levels in homeostatic or disease states. Using this approach in mice, we identified hun-
dreds of proteins trafficking from intestinal epithelium to subcutaneous WAT, visceral WAT, brown adipose tis-
sue, pancreas, and skeletal muscles in response to food intake, including the known low-abundance hormones
GLP1/2, SST, FGF15, BMP8b, REG3, and CCK. We identified PLEXIN-B2 as a novel intestine-secreted pro-
tein specifically targeting subcutaneous WAT. PLEXIN-B2 is produced during fasting and in diet-induced obesi-
ty, and acts through SEMA4A receptor and SCRIB signaling to reduce adipocyte lipolysis and to promote adi-
pogenesis. Our primary goal is to define the obesity-associated imbalances in intestine-secreted proteins, such
as PLEXIN-B2, that directly impact the depot-specific differences in adipogenesis, lipolysis, lipogenesis and
mitochondrial biogenesis, and contribute to systemic glucose and lipid metabolism, fibrosis, and inflammation.
We will first use the BirA*G3 approach to establish the interorgan circuitry of intestine-to-visceral and subcuta-
neous WAT communication during the development of obesity (Aim 1). Next, we will determine the impact of
intestine-secreted proteins on WAT depots and metabolic maladaptation in obesity (Aim 2). Finally, we will de-
fine the regulation of WAT depot function, metabolic homeostasis, and development of obesity by PLEXIN-B2
(Aim 3). In sum, we will discover mechanisms by which the intestine modulates WAT depot metabolic activities"

 With advancements in operative techniques and perioperative management, there is an increasing
number of patients with Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS) that are surviving into childhood and beyond.
Due to the chronic pressure and volume load placed on the single systemic ventricle, these patients remain at
constant risk for the development and progression of cardiac failure. Unfortunately, very little is known about
how the failing HLHS heart differs from the failing adult biventricular heart, but the extrapolation of proven adult
heart failure medications to the HLHS population has been unsuccessful, suggesting focused study is necessary
to better understand the mechanisms underlying maladaptive remodeling and eventual heart failure in HLHS.
 Our preliminary data suggest glycosphingolipids (GSLs) play a role in modulating cardiomyocyte and
immune cell function in HLHS, via both autocrine and paracrine signaling. Specifically, we show accumulation of
LacCer in the myocardium of HLHS patients. To test the effect of LacCer on cardiac myocytes directly, we treated
primary cardiomyocytes with liposomes carrying LacCer and determined that LacCer is sufficient to decrease
mitochondrial OXPHOS, increase oxidative stress, and upregulate pro-inflammatory gene expression. Similarly,
in vivo administration of LacCer induced right ventricular hypertrophy and decreased cardiac mitochondrial
respiratory capacity. Further, we determined that PBMCs from HLHS patients display increased levels of LacCer,
upregulated pro-inflammatory gene expression, and decreased mitochondrial OXPHOS. Similarly, treatment of
healthy PBMCs with LacCer promotes decreased mitochondrial OXPHOS. Additionally, conditioned media from
healthy PBMCs treated with LacCer is sufficient to promote mitochondrial dysfunction in primary cardiomyocytes,
suggesting LacCer-induced crosstalk via paracrine mediated effects. Therefore, our central hypothesis is that
aberrant glycosphingolipids drive maladaptive cardiac and immune cell responses and predispose HLHS
patients to life-limiting complications including cardiac dysfunction. Aim 1 will investigate whether LacCer
accumulation elicits a proinflammatory and metabolically dysfunctional phenotype in peripheral blood immune
cells (PBMCs), and Aim 2 will elucidate the mechanisms by which GSL accumulation alters cardiac myocyte
function. Our long-term goal is to ensure that HLHS patients benefit from rigorous pre-clinical studies in order to
provide the necessary framework to identify novel therapies, influence clinical care, and improve outcomes.
Successful completion of these aims will establish key mechanisms and modulators of heart failure progression
in HLHS and will elucidate a potential therapeutic pathway to mitigate progressive cardiac dysfunction in this
vulnerable population."

Substantial investments are being made to sequence the genomes of families with autism and other
neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). However, identifying disease mutations outside the ~1% of protein
coding sequences is challenging because 1) the ‘search space’ is much larger, and thus many more mutations
occur by chance, and 2) there is no simple code to identify deleterious mutations in non-coding sequences,
and thus loss of function mutations must be defined experimentally. In addition, the consequences of mutations
in non-coding (i.e. regulatory) sequences are often highly dependent on the specific cell type. Thus, functional
assays must be conducted in vivo, in the appropriate CNS cell types.
To address the search space challenge, we have focused specifically on the untranslated regions (UTRs)
of mRNAs. UTRs are important, conserved regulatory sequences that profoundly impact protein levels by
altering translation rates or transcript stability for specific genes. To address the lack of a code for interpreting
UTR mutations, we have developed a unique combination of expertise to conduct massively parallel
functional analysis of UTR variants from NDD patients, in relevant cell types in the brain. Combining
two innovative but established components: massively parallel reporter assays, and cell type specific
translational profiling, we aim to establish a pipeline to 1) Identify UTR mutations that result in altered protein
levels, 2) conduct genetic burden and association testing on these variants, and 3) train machine learning
models that can predict the effects of future mutations in developing neurons of the brain. This project will
leverage the existing large investment in NDD genome sequencing by defining individual non-coding, disease-
causing mutations in a class of sequences that has, so far, not been the focus of disease studies."

There is a significant gap in understanding and quantifying vocal hyperfunction, a common symptom in patients
with phonotraumatic and nonphonotraumatic dysphonia. Vocal hyperfunction is characterized by excessive per-
ilaryngeal muscle activity and often leads to muscle pain, increased vocal effort and strain, and vocal fatigue.
Current diagnostic methods rely heavily on subjective patient reports and unvalidated clinical evaluations, mak-
ing it challenging for clinicians to accurately diagnose and track treatment outcomes, which ultimately impacts
the quality of care provided to these patients. The proposed research aims to address this gap by developing a
novel biomarker of vocal hyperfunction: functional synergistic perilaryngeal muscle network connectivity using
synchronized multisensor surface electromyography. This innovative approach will create a new spectrotempo-
ral synergistic scan to quantify the complex coordination (and discoordination) of perilaryngeal muscles during
typical and dysphonic voicing. This method is expected to provide a more reliable and objective measure of vo-
cal hyperfunction. The central hypothesis is that vocal hyperfunction is characterized by disturbances in mus-
cle coordination during voicing, which can be measured using the functional synergistic perilaryngeal muscle
network connectivity scans. This hypothesis will be tested in three aims. Aim 1: Distinguish patterns of peri-
laryngeal muscle discoordination across dysphonic conditions. Aim 2: Quantify the synergistic perilaryngeal
neuromuscular response to standard treatment. Aim 3: Determine the synergistic perilaryngeal neuromuscular
response to vocal demand. These specific aims will improve understanding of the variable pathophysiology of
vocal hyperfunction in different types of dysphonia. The proposed research is significant because it will shift our
understanding of voice disorders by providing an objective biomarker of vocal hyperfunction pathophysiology.
This approach, characterized by its objectivity, reliability, repeatability, and specificity, is crucial for accurate di-
agnosis. This will, in turn, enhance the delivery of effective care, promote early diagnosis, reduce instances of
misdiagnosis, and contribute to the advancement towards precision medicine. Objective measurement of vo-
cal hyperfunction can also help navigate treatment plans by tracking neurophysiological responses, enabling
informed therapy and dosing. Ultimately, the knowledge gained from this research has the potential to inform
future clinical trials assessing the predictive ability of this biomarker for treatment responses for vocal hyperfunc-
tion. This could lead to a paradigm shift in the management of vocal hyperfunction-related dysphonia, paving
the way for more targeted and effective treatments"

Accumulating evidence from individual clinical trials and conventional trial level meta-analysis suggests that
restrictive transfusion threshold of 7 to 8 g/dL is as safe and effective as the 9 to10 g/dL threshold, based
largely on an analysis of the primary outcome of mortality. However, it is much less clear whether the safety of
restrictive hemoglobin thresholds applies to all patient groups. In this revised application, we focus the aims on
patients with underlying cardiovascular disease given recent results that suggest patients with acute
myocardial infarction could be harmed by restrictive transfusion strategy and that it is especially important to
evaluate restrictive transfusion in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Individual clinical trials do
not have adequate sample size and conventional trial level meta-analysis lack the specific detail to examine
the effect of transfusion in specific subgroups. An individual patient data meta-analysis (IPDMA) will have the
power and detail to fully explore the effects of transfusion thresholds across clinically important subgroups.
For this IPDMA, randomized clinical trials that assigned patients red blood cell transfusions based on
transfusion threshold (sometimes also referred to as trigger) have been identified from systematic searches of
the literature. The search will be updated and supplemented by direct query of experts in the field prior
finalizing the studies that are included. Data use agreements and letters of support document the
commitments of investigators to provide individual patient data from 89% of the participants included in these
trials. The IPDMA will be combined into a single comprehensive analysis database. The aims of the analysis
are to 1) Primary Aim: To estimate the treatment effect of liberal versus restrictive transfusion thresholds in
patients with cardiovascular disease including those with myocardial infarction, pre-existing cardiovascular
disease and cardiac surgery. We will evaluate clinically important pre-specified risk factors including older age,
sex, heart failure, type of MI, baseline hemoglobin concentration, and others on primary and secondary
outcomes. 2) Secondary Aim: To estimate the treatment effect of liberal versus restrictive transfusion
thresholds in other clinically important pre-specified subgroups with severe chronic illnesses including cancers
and chronic renal diseases, GI bleeding and by age and sex. 3)Exploratory: Use a personalized medicine
approach to create models designed to identify risk factors and combinations of risk factors that modify the
effect of transfusion strategy on the primary and secondary outcomes.
The results will advance our knowledge about the impact of transfusion threshold in cardiovascular and other
clinically important patient groups, where there is concern about the safety of applying a universal `restrictive'
hemoglobin threshold for transfusion. If liberal transfusion is shown to be superior to restrictive transfusion in
patient groups, guidelines will be updated and clinical practice will need to change."

Glioblastomas rank among the most lethal of all human cancers. Current therapy includes maximal surgical
resection, followed by combined radiotherapy and oral chemotherapy (temozolomide), and adjuvant
temozolomide. However, current glioblastoma therapy offers only palliation. Median survival for glioblastoma
patients has been reported to be 15-21 months, but these data are derived from patients with favorable age
and performance status. Glioblastoma ranks among the human cancers most thoroughly studied, yet
precision medicine efforts have demonstrated very limited efficacy. Like many cancers, glioblastomas display
altered metabolism that promotes tumor growth, often through the generation of metabolites that promote
epigenetic reprogramming. In the current proposal, we focus on the role of specific essential amino acids that
appear to the preferentially taken up by brain tumor cells. Upon cellular entry, amino acids can undergo
catabolism to generate bioactive intermediates that can alter the chromatin landscape and modulate tumor-
immune interactions.
Based on this background, we investigated differential expression of metabolic pathways and amino acid
levels between glioblastoma cells and neural stem cells, revealing critical selective dependencies in tumor
cells due to both altered gene expression and genetic lesions. As a result, glioblastoma cells suppress the
anti-tumor immune response. In the proposed studies, we will investigate the molecular and cell biology
mechanisms through which selective amino acid metabolism regulates brain tumor growth and immune
interplay. Systems to be used include patient-derived cultures, organoids, and xenografts to determine the
molecular determinants of amino acid catabolism and epigenetic reprogramming. To translate these efforts
into novel preclinical paradigms, we propose to use dietary manipulations that have been developed for
treatment of inborn errors of metabolism, including those that affect the brain. These dietary interventions
can potentially be combined with other therapies, including targeted therapies and immune checkpoint
inhibitors, to target glioblastomas. Collectively, the proposed studies will lay the foundation for improved
understanding of tumor metabolism in brain tumor biology with possible application to oncologic care."

According to the statistics provided by the American Cancer Society, in 2023, about 1.9 million new cancer cases
will be diagnosed in the United States, and more than 609K people will die from this disease. Such data firmly
highlights the importance of continued efforts to find new and effective ways to detect and treat cancer, with the
ultimate goal of reducing the number of diagnoses and fatalities. Epitranscriptomics has lately enlarged insights
into the field of cancer biology. RNA modifications occur in coding and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including
microRNAs (miRs). miRs are small single-stranded ncRNAs, which play a crucial role as negative regulators of
gene expression, typically via partial base-pairing complementarity with their target transcripts. Post-
transcriptional modification phenomena associated with miRs, such as imprecise cleavage of the miRNA
sequence and Adenosine-to-Inosine RNA Editing events, can alter the miR canonical sequence and function.
Recently, modified miRs (miR isoforms) have been proposed as potential innovative biomarkers for cancer
diagnosis and surveillance. However, concurrent profiling of modified miRs has yet to be investigated in cancer
properly. Additionally, no online resource offers easy and comprehensive consultation to study miR isoforms in
cancer. Solutions to these gaps would positively impact discovering novel potential cancer biomarkers and
uncovering cancer-related mechanisms associated with a broader miRNAome. Recently, we concurrently
profiled canonical and modified (e.g., shifted or DNA/RNA edited) miRs in >13K adult and pediatric cancer
samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and The Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate
Effective Treatments (TARGET) repositories (38 cohorts) (Distefano et al. 2022, Cancer Research). We
accurately identified >8K expressed miR isoforms (>5-fold the canonical miRs). By merging canonical and
modified miRs, we boosted the quality of clustering results by improving the patients’ clinicopathologic
stratification. Additionally, the broader miRNAome profiling uncovered a larger number of significant prognostic
signatures. We also implemented an ad-hoc miR isoform-target prediction method and validated unique targeting
for a shifted miR isoform. Therefore, our proposal intends to outline (1) the function and (2) the post-
transcriptional regulation of the broader miRNAome in a cancer-context manner by in-silico analyses and
experimental validations. Moreover, to make the extensive amount of generated data available to the scientific
community, we propose (3) building isomiRGate, a freely accessible online gateway. isomiRGate platform will
serve as a tool to I) elucidate the role of miR isoforms as potential cancer biomarkers and II) deduce the function
and regulation of the broader miRNAome in cancer. We aim to create a platform, isomiRGate, adaptable to new
analysis methods, holding the potential to lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for treating this
deadly disease, with anticipated future clinical applications."
10991076,"Transporting cellular cargo with spatial and temporal precision is critical for many processes in all cells. Different
cell types and organisms use diverse machineries for long-distance cargo transport. For example, mammalian
cells and many filamentous fungi transport cargo using the microtubule-based motors dynein and kinesin, while
yeast use myosin motors on actin cytoskeleton tracks. Despite a general understanding of cellular transport and
the motors involved, little is known about how similar transport machineries are adapted by specific cell types or
organisms. Dr. Christensen’s current research investigates canonical (motor-driven) and non-canonical cargo
transport. In this proposal, she will investigate how both modes of transport have evolved in different organisms
using an innovative approach in which evolutionary hypotheses are directly tested using comparative cell biology
in fungal and mammalian cells. Defects in transport are particularly prevalent in neurological disorders such as
Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s and ALS. Examining how diverse cell types differently use the transport machinery is
directly applicable to understanding how transport defects lead to cell-specific diseases.
 In Aim 1, Dr. Christensen will investigate how regulators of motor-driven transport have evolved in fungi
and human cells. In her current research and the K99 phase of this award, she will investigate how the gene
expansion and functional diversification of the ‘FHF’ protein complex allows dynein to bind multiple cargos in
human cells. For the R00 phase of this award, Dr. Christensen will identify and characterize novel dynein
regulators using evolutionary analysis and comparative cell biology in A. nidulans and human cells.
 In Aim 2, Dr. Christensen will investigate a non-canonical form of transport known as ‘hitchhiking’. In
hitchhiking, a cargo attaches to and is co-transported with another cargo to achieve motility. Hitchhiking has
been demonstrated to occur in two evolutionarily divergent species of filamentous fungi, Aspergillus nidulans
and Ustilago maydis. In the K99 phase of this award, she will investigate a potential evolutionary advantage of
peroxisome hitchhiking in A. nidulans and determine if mRNA hitchhiking convergently evolved in A. nidulans
and U. maydis. In the R00 phase of this award, she will determine if hitchhiking occurs in a third filamentous
fungus, Ashbya gossypiii, a fungus lacking canonical microtubule-based transport.
 Dr. Christensen’s goal is to develop an independent research program at the interface of cell and
evolutionary biology. To accomplish this, she will attend conferences spanning fields and participate in UCSD-
sponsored and MOSAIC UE5 initiatives focused on lab management and the transition to independence. She
will receive guidance from her mentoring committee (faculty listed below) and her primary mentor, Sam Reck-
Peterson. This development plan, combined with training in evolutionary biology (with Matt Daugherty, UCSD),
mammalian cell vesicle trafficking assays (with Susan Ferro-Novick, UCSD), and A. gossypii (with Amy
Gladfelter, UNC Chapel Hill) will prepare her to excel in an independent position."
10988379,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Even though 60-85% of Plasmodium vivax (Pv) infections are caused by dormant liver stages, known as
hypnozoites (HZs), the molecular mechanisms that govern dormancy remain largely unknown. Without this
information, new interventions to eliminate HZs cannot be developed, and Pv malaria will continue to cause
substantial morbidity and socioeconomic hardships. The long-term goal of our research program is to understand
the molecular mechanisms that govern HZ dormancy so that these processes can serve as targets for new
therapeutics. The objective of this proposal is to understand how HZs are formed by addressing if Pv sporozoites
are pre-destined to develop into HZs or replicating schizonts (SZs) before or after invading a liver cell. This
information is needed because understanding how HZs are formed may lead to the identification of new
therapeutic approaches to eliminate them. Prior research has attempted to address if sporozoites are already
committed to dormancy prior to invading a liver cell, but the studies have been inconclusive because Pv
sporozoites with fixed, pre-determined fates have not been used. In preliminary studies, our team has overcome
this limitation by optimizing procedures to produce Pv North Korean, Brazil VII, and Chesson sporozoites. We
show that sporozoites from these strains develop into (1) nearly all HZs, (2) virtually no HZs, and (3) a mixture
of HZs and SZs, respectively, after invading primary human hepatocytes in vitro. The characterization of these
strains has provided the necessary technical innovation to determine if Pv sporozoites are pre-destined to
develop into dormant HZs or replicating SZs before or after invading a liver cell. Our central hypothesis is that
the fate of sporozoites is pre-programmed by distinct transcriptional programs that poise sporozoites to develop
into HZs or SZs. The rationale for this hypothesis is based on our preliminary data that these strains consistently
form the same proportions of HZs irrespective of the hepatocyte donor used or multiple passages through the
mosquito; therefore, fate must be pre-programmed in sporozoites. This proposal will test that hypothesis by
pursuing two specific aims. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that Pv sporozoites are pre-programmed to develop
into HZs prior to hepatocyte invasion while Aim 2 will test the alternative hypothesis that development into a
hypnozoite is determined after hepatocyte invasion. The expected outcomes of this work is the determination of
when a Pv sporozoite commits to becoming a HZ and the molecular programs involved in this process. The
results of these studies will have an important positive impact because they may lead to the identification of new
therapeutic strategies to treat HZs."

Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T) cell cancer therapies are thwarted by the difficulty of targeting antigens on
solid tumor cells. Archetypal CAR-binding tumor cell surface proteins are not unique to tumor cells and can also
be found on host cells. Further, solid tumor cells express these antigens at different levels, even within one
tumor. In this complex and immunosuppressive environment, the standard CAR T strategy of targeting tumor
cell surface proteins is insufficient and results in off-tumor CAR T cell binding and activation, leading ultimately
to T cell exhaustion. To solve this problem, we propose a modular, logic-gated split CAR format that can respond
to the combination of tumor cell surface proteins and metabolites enriched in the TME by clustering intracellular
domains to activate T cell signaling pathways. This format allows for CAR T cells to activate the production of
cytokines, cell adhesion proteins, and other tumor destruction modalities only after localizing to the TME.
The proposal has three Aims. In Aim 1, we will establish the split CAR format for targeting solid tumors, which
includes two synthetic receptors that are each fused to compatible intracellular co-stimulatory domains and
cytokine engagement domains. One receptor, engineered from the blueprint of the human GABAB G-protein
coupled receptor (GPCR), will function as a small molecule “sensor receptor”; its “partner receptor” will bind to a
tumor cell surface protein as well as the agonist-bound form of the first receptor. When the paired receptors are
bound to the extracellular agonist and the tumor cell surface protein, their co-stimulatory domains will localize
together inside the cell to activate NFAT signaling in Jurkat reporter cells. In Aim 2, simultaneously with Aim 1,
we will adapt the sensor receptors to bind and respond to TME metabolites by developing a computational
protein design protocol to reengineer their binding sites. We will screen the designed protein library to isolate
TME metabolite-responsive CARs and tune their binding for physiologically relevant metabolite concentrations
using established experimental protein engineering methods. In preliminary data, we have prototyped a
computational design strategy and TME sensor receptor format using homologous model receptors. In the final
Aim, we will combine the redesigned TME metabolite receptors with a HER2+ breast cancer-specific partner
receptor to deploy the split CARs in primary human T cells co-cultured with HER2+ breast tumor cells and monitor
T cell activation and tumor cell lysis as a proxy for CAR T efficacy. Following the successful application of our
CAR T strategy in cell culture as described in this proposal, we will next collaborate with leading T cell biologists
at our university to deploy the receptors in a preclinical humanized mouse model to evaluate CAR T efficacy in
vivo. Our proposed CAR T cell therapy platform is unique in its capacity to bind to a both an endogenous TME
metabolite and a tumor cell surface marker to elicit a programmable intracellular T cell activation response."

Hematologic malignancies are often treated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
However, HSCT is complicated by graft-vs-host disease (GvHD), a severe, potentially lethal complication
initiated when donor alloreactive T cells attack host cells and organs. Despite the administration of prophylactic
regimens for aGVHD as standard pre-transplantation therapy, up to 60% of these patients develop aGVHD of
grade II or higher, and require additional immunosuppressive intervention. Thus, there is an urgent need to
improve pre-transplantation therapies to prevent aGVHD. We identified a probiotic exopolysaccharide (EPS)
that induces tolerogenic dendritic cells (DCs) that inhibit T cell proliferation, and we found that EPS-treated
human DCs (EPS-DCs) both inhibited T cell proliferation in mixed lymphocyte reactions, and significantly
increased survival of humanized NSG-HLA-A2 mice after transplantation with human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (hPBMC). The data indicate that a cell-based therapy using EPS-DCs can mitigate aGvHD,
and the goal of this grant is to optimize the EPS-DC dosage for maximum protection from GvHD, and to
determine the molecular mechanism by which these EPS-DCs inhibit proliferation of alloreactive T cells both in
vitro and in vivo. These studies will provide a novel cell-based therapy for preventing GvHD in patients
receiving HSCT. This cell therapy will be translatable to humans because large numbers of EPS-DCs can be
generated and frozen in bulk and used as “off the shelf” treatment, for all patients, independent of MHC types."
10995509,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Healthcare and research organizations, including the American Society for Clinical Oncology, acknowledge the
common use of stigmatizing language in cancer care. However, stigmatizing language has not been
comprehensively defined, and drivers and outcomes of this language use have not been investigated in cancer
care. One way that discrimination and stigma manifest in the healthcare system is through the electronic health
record (EHR), which can reflect the author’s implicit and explicit bias. Reading stigmatizing language alters
readers’ clinical decisions in vignette studies. Thus, there is an opportunity to evaluate EHR stigmatizing
language as a modifiable mechanism of decreasing discrimination and improving outcomes in cancer care.
The long-term goal is to evaluate sociocultural and healthcare system influences of EHR stigmatizing language
and resulting changes in clinical decision-making in cancer care. The central hypothesis is that stigmatizing
language is present in the cancer care EHR, inequitably experienced, and associated with altered clinical
decision-making. The hypothesis will be tested via the following specific aims: (1) Determine the categories of
stigmatizing language used by oncology clinicians when documenting patient encounters in the EHR; (2)
Compare stigmatizing language in the cancer care EHR by patient and clinician characteristics; (3) Determine
if stigmatizing language use is associated with disparities in medication prescription for cancer-related pain.
This study will leverage EHR data from a large academic and community healthcare system in Minnesota. Aim
1 utilizes a qualitative study design to perform a directed content analysis of the unstructured, free text section
of outpatient oncology EHR notes. Aims 2 & 3 use natural language processing to abstract stigmatizing terms
and phrases for each individual with outpatient cancer visits in 2022. Multilevel models will be utilized to
account for nested visit-level data within patient-level data within clinician-level data. This project is innovative
in its characterization and modeling of stigmatizing language in cancer care and will have significant impact by
informing interventions to reduce stigma, health disparities, and resulting negative health outcomes. By
focusing on EHR stigmatizing language, this project addresses emerging opportunities and challenges as
medical records become accessible to patients and persist throughout their lives. The applicant is an MD/PhD
and Epidemiology PhD student at the University of Minnesota Schools of Medicine and Public Health. By
expanding content knowledge in cancer survivorship and disparities, rigorous qualitative and quantitative
analysis skills, tailored clinical training, and focused professional development opportunities, this fellowship will
enhance her ability to excel in the MD/PhD program and become an independent academic physician-
epidemiologist."
10995512,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The global burden of sexually transmitted infections has increased over the last several decades. In 2020
alone, the World Health Organization estimated that 128.5 million incident cases of Chlamydia trachomatis
(CT) occurred among individuals of reproductive age. Although risk of infection persists across the general
population, young women aged 15–24 years, as well as gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men
(MSM), have a significantly greater risk for acquiring CT. Successful interruption of CT infections and
subsequent sequalae requires the implementation of wide-scale public health prevention measures. However,
effective primary- and secondary-level prevention strategies, including prophylactic antibiotic use and vaccines,
are underutilized or unavailable. Interest in the use of doxycycline prophylaxis has grown in recent years but
concerns of antibiotic resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoea and future resistance in CT limit its feasibility and
warrant additional research on considerations for successful implementation. Given these concerns, an
effective vaccine is likely required for enduring population-level declines in CT infections. Testing of vaccines to
protect against CT infections has thus far been limited to Phase I trials and further testing is needed to
understand the efficacy and safety among broader populations. The vaccine development process could be
strengthened by parallel investigations using mathematical models and health economic evaluations to assess
the impact of a CT vaccine. This proposal addresses the following questions: Among individuals potentially
eligible for antibiotic prophylaxis, what is the frequency of, and characteristics associated with, antibiotic use
that can inform the utility of doxycycline as a preventative measure? What are the potential impacts of a
proposed CT vaccine on disease burden? Is CT vaccination a cost-effective prevention strategy compared to
current screen-and-treat practices in the United States? To answer these questions, the project will
characterize the frequency and factors associated with antibiotic use among MSM in Seattle, WA (Aim
1) using longitudinal data from the ExGen Study, a prospective cohort study of MSM. Second, a mathematical
model will be developed to predict the 50-year impact of national rollout of a theoretical vaccine on the
burden of urogenital and rectal CT infections in the United States (Aim 2). Model structure and
parameters will be sourced from peer-reviewed published literature, publicly available surveillance systems,
and vaccine target product profiles. Finally, the cost-effectiveness of CT vaccination strategies, in
combination with screen-and-treat interventions, will be compared to screen-and-treat alone in the
United States (Aim 3) using the mathematical model developed in Aim 2, alongside cost data from peer-
reviewed and public sources. This research addresses critical knowledge gaps about CT prevention strategies
and serves as a training opportunity for the applicant to develop into an independent, academic researcher."
10995385,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over 60% of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALLs) harbor mutations in the NOTCH1 signaling pathway,
making Notch activation the most common oncogenic pathway in T-ALL. However, pan-Notch inhibitors are
associated with dose-limiting toxicities, primarily gastrointestinal. We previously showed that the transcription
factor ETS1 is essential for Notch-activated T-ALL survival. ETS1 inhibition impairs T-ALL survival and
downregulates major oncogenic Notch target genes. Further, ETS1 deletion has limited toxicities in murine
models. These findings suggest targeting ETS1 might have strong anti-leukemic effects with more favorable
toxicity profile than Notch inhibitors. While ETS1 and NOTCH1 activate many overlapping pathways, the cis-
regulatory elements downstream of ETS1 are less well defined and may play a more essential role than NOTCH1
for activation of some T-ALL enhancers. I identified one such enhancer in which ETS1 may play a more essential
role than NOTCH1. Here, ETS1 is required to activate expression of MYB, a critical T-ALL oncogene (tentatively
named “E-Me” for ETS1-dependent MYB Enhancer). My preliminary data shows that ETS1 is required for E-Me
activation and MYB expression, and E-Me repression in human T-ALL cell lines inhibits MYB expression and
cell survival. Based on these preliminary studies, I hypothesize that ETS1 drives T-ALL survival by activating
the E-Me and other essential regulatory elements for T-ALL oncogenes. I will investigate this hypothesis through
two aims. In my first aim, I will determine the consequences of E-Me blockade in Notch-activated T-ALL survival
in vivo using two murine models. In my second aim, I will further define the cis-regulatory elements and
oncogenes downstream of ETS1 in T-ALL. The enhancers and transcription factor dependencies that regulate
oncogene expression in T-ALL arecurrently poorly understood, raising barriers to targeted therapeutic
strategies. My proposal will help close this gap in knowledge. Finally, the overall impact of this project will be to
define the role of ETS1 as a driver of essential T-ALL oncogenic pathways and enable the discovery of other
essential transcription factors in T-ALL."

Glioblastoma (GBM) is a CNS tumor derived from glial cells. It is the most common and fatal primary malignant
brain tumor in adults with a median survival of 15 months. Current treatment strategies involve surgical resection
followed by radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy. Unfortunately, GBM is highly resistant to therapy and
will inevitably recur, resulting in poor patient outcomes. GBM has been described as having an oxygen-deprived
niche and a perivascular, oxygen-rich, niche. Deeper characterization of these tumor environments has revealed
the presence of cellular heterogeneity, angiogenesis, and invasion in both niches. The critical cellular player
involved with these tumor behaviors is the glioblastoma stem-like cell (GSC). GSCs seem to reside in both
hypoxic (low oxygen level) and normoxic (normal oxygen level) niches yet maintain their stemness and self-
renewal capacities across both conditions. Strategies to target these GSCs have proven to be unsuccessful so
far but remain a promising avenue for research. There is a need to develop a greater understanding of GSC
biology, starting with the regulatory mechanisms with which they adapt to the hypoxic environment of GBM and
promote tumor growth. However, most studies exploring GSCs are performed in normoxic conditions. Further,
the central aspect of post-transcriptional gene regulation, translation, where genetic information is converted to
functional proteins, remains relatively unexplored. The objective of the proposed research is to study the
translation (mRNA-to-protein) regulatory step of protein synthesis in GSCs, as opposed to the more commonly
explore transcription (DNA-to-mRNA) regulatory step, with the desired outcome of illuminating systemic
programs for hypoxic adaptation. To accomplish this objective, our approach in Aim 1 will use ribosome
profiling (RIBO-seq) in conjunction with RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to offer a quantitative understanding
of transcriptional and translational regulatory pressures on mRNA transcripts. I will utilize both techniques to
clarify the influence on hypoxia on translational gene regulation in GSCs. I expect to find genes and gene-sets,
representing biological pathways, that are modulated by hypoxia predominantly through translational regulation,
revealing a novel list of candidates for future therapy. To validate this discovery framework, I will perform an array
of functional studies on selected genes. In parallel, Aim 2 will focus on a particular set of translational
machinery known as the Integrated Stress Response (ISR), whose members sense cellular stress and
modulate translation of survival-associated transcripts. With burgeoning evidence of aberrant ISR behavior in
malignant cells, interrogating the mechanism through which the ISR may mediate translational changes in
hypoxic GSCs will present another avenue through which to halt such adaptive behaviors. Altogether, this
proposal will promote further understanding of GSC biology, with respect to translation regulation, thereby
unveiling novel targets for future GBM therapy and ultimately contribute to brain tumor patient care."

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends two key interventions to protect young children in
sub-Saharan Africa from Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) malaria morbidity and mortality. Seasonal
malaria chemoprevention (SMC) provides a full course of antimalarial drugs every month of the high
transmission period in seasonal transmission areas. More recently, RTS,S vaccination to prevent malaria in
young children in areas of moderate to high transmission has also been recommended following the promising
results of large-scale pilot study. Ghana is one of three countries in this pilot study and is the only country in
the world where both SMC and RTS,S have been implemented in a broad population. SMC has been
implemented at the regional level and RTS,S vaccine administration has been randomized by district through
the implementation pilot program. This means that in a small geographic area, we can evaluate children
who have received SMC and/or RTS,S or neither of these interventions.
In our on-going surveillance of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, we identified school-age children (ages five
to fifteen years) as the population with the highest prevalence of malaria infection. These infections typically do
not cause severe disease. However, because immunity to malaria is acquired through repeated exposures,
children who receive SMC and/or RTS,S vaccine may have delayed immune development and experience
increased malaria disease burden and more frequent severe disease after the interventions end at five
years of age. Alternatively, decreasing exposure to malaria in early life may allow children to develop a more
robust immune response to Pf and thus lead to a reduced risk of infection and disease as they reach school-
age. Finally, vaccine antibodies, especially in children who completed the primary series plus the
recommended booster, may continue to protect children beyond five years of age.
Thus, the opportunity to study children who received various combinations of RTS,S and/or SMC is unique
in Ghana and timely for all high malaria burden countries. We propose a longitudinal cohort study of four
groups of children ages five to seven years with a history of different combinations of exposures to early
childhood interventions: SMC alone, RTS,S alone, SMC plus RTS,S, or none of these interventions. We
designed the study to understand the epidemiological impact of vaccination and SMC on the burden of malaria
infection and disease at five to seven years of age through a longitudinal study assessing Pf prevalence and
the incidence of clinical disease. We have also proposed innovative serological profiling, fine epitope mapping,
and genomic approaches to understanding the immunological and parasitological basis of our observations to
inform the next generation of interventions."

This proposal aims to investigate dysregulation of alternative polyadenylation (APA) in acute myeloid leukemia
(AML). Dysregulation of APA has been identified in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in AML, but
previous studies have compared bulk populations of HSPCs from AML patients to healthy donors. Therefore,
the extent of dysregulation in malignant hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and the molecular regulators driving
this phenomenon remain poorly understood. To address these questions, this proposal outlines two specific
aims that leverage a previously developed computational platform for identifying shifts in polyA site usage at
single-cell resolution. The first aim will use single-cell RNA sequencing data from AML patients to characterize
changes in polyA site usage between malignant and healthy HSPCs at matched differentiation stages within
the same donor. This will identify if changes in APA originate in leukemic stem cells or are restricted to more
committed progenitors. PolyA site usage is heterogenous between patients and even healthy donors, so
comparisons within the same donor will improve accuracy on identifying true changes in polyA site usage. The
second aim extends a sequence-based deep learning framework to model polyA site usage in human HSPCs
with over/under expression of different CPA regulators. This model will elucidate the extent to which CPSF6, a
subunit of cleavage-factor I complex that is downregulated at the transcriptional level in AML patients, drives
aberrant polyA site usage in AML. If CPSF6 downregulation is not sufficient to explain dysregulated polyA site
usage, additional factors that contribute will be identified. Finally, CRISPR perturbation studies will be used to
assess if modulating the expression of CPSF6 expression (and other implicated regulators) affects
differentiation state in AML cell lines, providing functional evidence that APA is involved in maintaining a
leukemic state. The completion of these aims will provide a new understanding of APA in myeloid
malignancies and may lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets."

The goals of the proposed K99 career training plan include: 1) gaining expertise and research experience in
substance use disorders (SUD), addictive processes, and opioid pharmacology; 2) mastering stereotaxic sur-
geries, adeno-associated virus gene delivery, and in vivo fiber photometry; and 3) mastering and applying ana-
lytical skills for the evaluation of third variable effects. The proposed research affords a venue to achieve the
goals of the training plan and address key challenges in the prescription opioid epidemic. Adolescence and
young adulthood (i.e., 12-25 years of age) are critical developmental periods associated with substance use
initiation and brain circuit maturation, with the former having key potential impacts on the latter. To date, however,
the critical role of adolescent prescription opioid use disorder (APOUD) on neurocognitive development, and
associated neural mechanisms, has yet to be fully elucidated. The role of biological sex and comorbidities (i.e.,
HIV-1) will be integral to the experimental design. We will causally test the guiding hypothesis that alterations
in the mesocortical dopamine (DA) system mechanistically underlie the differential progression of neurocognitive
development in experimental (oxycodone (OXY) dependent) vs. control animals; and that unique neural mech-
anisms will be engaged by comorbid APOUD and HIV-1. The hypothesis will be addressed via two building block
aims (K99 phase) and formally tested in my independent laboratory (R00 phase). Key aspects of human APOUD
will be modeled using a preclinical voluntary oral OXY self-administration experimental paradigm. In Specific
Aim #1 (K99 phase), the dose-dependency of OXY self-administration for neurocognitive development (e.g.,
preattentive processes, long-term episodic memory, sustained attention) will be established using a longitudinal
experimental design. In Specific Aim #2 (K99 phase), dopaminergic alterations in the mesocortical DA system
following OXY self-administration during assessments of higher-order cognitive processes will be determined
using novel G protein-coupled receptor based biosensors and in vivo fiber photometry. Specific Aim #3 (R00
phase) affords a causal test of the neural mechanism underlying neurocognitive impairments resulting from
APOUD and/or comorbid HIV-1; the fundamental goal of my independent laboratory. Specifically, the mesocor-
tical DA system will be stimulated using designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs during
assessments of higher-order cognitive processes (e.g., sustained attention). Training (K99 phase) will be con-
ducted at the University of South Carolina, an outstanding environment, under the tutelage of an internationally
recognized mentoring team, including Dr. R.M. Booze (mentor), Dr. E.M. Unterwald (co-mentor) and Dr. A.J.
Fairchild (co-mentor). Additionally, a Professional Development Advisory Committee, including highly-regarded
faculty from multiple institutions (Dr. S. Letendre, Dr. T.D. Langford, and Dr. S. Fitting), is integral to the career
training plan. Successful completion of the proposed training, career development activities, and research will
provide a strong foundation for the candidate’s transition to an independent scientist."

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) accounts for $42 billion in annual Medicare spending, and >50% of end-stage
kidney disease (ESKD) cases. The Renal Pathology Society endorses the use of tissue morphometric features
of DKD with discrete classification based on the peak visual semi-quantitative measure of renal tissue
morphometry. These features may lack sensitivity to correlate with clinical biometrics (e.g., eGFR) measured at
the time of biopsy or during follow-up. A multimodal evidence-based quantitative method is required to deliver
continuous scoring by engaging molecular information along with digital histopathology, and summarizing the
contributions of each pixel of a renal tissue histopathology image using quantitative morphometry and omics.
The investigator team has pioneered the unbiased quantitative morphometry of DKD over the last five years in
their existing R01, conducting extensive quantification of novel image pixel features with clinical significance,
and focusing on how computational artificial intelligence (AI) improves precision and accuracy, outperforming
existing diagnostic standards. An opportunity exists to translate their developed tools in a clinically meaningful
form that aids a pathologist in biopsy assessment or a nephrologist in therapy selection. Capitalizing on their
extensive work in the field of DKD digital pathology, the investigator team will: 1) translate their developed digital
pathology tools to clinicians’ desks in the next five years, 2) extend digital pathology by integrating spatial
molecular features to reveal hidden digital image biomarkers, and 3) provide clinicians with additional useful
metrics for biopsy assessment to augment the current treatment strategy of DKD. Recently, this team has
significantly advanced spatial anchoring of cell types and cell states (e.g., injury, recovery, adaptation) in
brightfield histology using paired data from spatial transcriptomics. This effort will be extended to the single-cell
level in this application. The team has also delivered to the community the first cloud application of quantitative
digital pathology tissue assessment via a single-click, promoting FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable,
reusable) data principles. Based on these preliminary efforts, this renewal application will implement a pipeline
for the clinical use of computational pathology in DKD. The central hypothesis is that computational pathology of
DKD, integrated with spatial omics, offers transformative tools for DKD diagnostic classification, prognosis, and
therapy selection. In particular, the team will: 1) Develop an end-user cloud software for clinical DKD biopsy
assessment using continuous risk scoring; 2) Determine the digital histopathology image pixel features
corresponding to molecular cell processes with clinical significance; 3) Test whether image pixel and spatial
transcriptomics quantitative vectors of glomerular hypertension predict progression and optimal DKD therapy.
With these deliverables, this renewal R01 application will shift the paradigm, transforming digital and
computational DKD pathology to improve prognosis, diagnosis, interpretation of molecular processes, and
therapy selection in DKD, and thus lead the way to translating the developed tools into the clinic."

PROJECT SUMMARY
Three-year overall survival for patients with recurrent osteosarcoma (OS) is 20%. Current therapy for metastatic
osteosarcoma (OS) is largely ineffective. Over the past four decades no new therapies have been identified for
OS. Our overall objective is to evaluate the potential efficacy and toxicity of targeted alpha-particle
radiopharmaceutical therapy (αRPT) against OS. Targeted alpha-emitter therapy is a promising treatment
modality that is not susceptible to the resistance mechanism observed for chemotherapy, traditional
radiotherapy, targeted (i.e., pathway inhibition) therapy and immunotherapy. This is because alpha-particles
cause massive and irreparable DNA double-strand break damage, irrespective of oxygenation, dose-rate, cell
signaling or mutational burden. Osteosarcoma expresses the ganglioside GD2 receptor that can be targeted by
the anti-GD2 antibody (Ab), Hu3F8. We propose to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 225Ac-Hu3F8 (A3F8) in a
naturally occurring, large animal model of osteosarcoma. Actinium-225 emits 4 alpha-particles per decay and
has a 10-day half-life. These experiments in client-owned dogs, which develop metastatic OS disease at a higher
rate than people, would be the first evaluation of radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) with an alpha-emitter-
conjugated Ab that targets both soft-tissue and calcified disseminated OS — a highly radioresistant disease.
A two-cycle treatment scheme will be used wherein a fixed administered activity (AA) of A3F8, will be directly
imaged by SPECT using a novel proprietary technique developed by Rapid, LLC (a Hopkins startup that has
licensed α-particle emitter dosimetry and imaging technology) to obtain pharmacokinetics (PK) for dosimetry and
treatment planning to identify the AA that balances potential toxicity with maximum anti-tumor efficacy. The
specific aims are: 1. Identify the maximum tolerated absorbed dose (MTAD) to the red marrow in client-owned
dogs with OS; utilizing SPECT imaging, collect PK to relate dose-limiting organ (DLO) absorbed dose (AD) to
measured toxicity. 2. Determine treatment efficacy at the MTAD. 3. Evaluate how different measured or
calculated quantities (e.g., tumor burden, tumor AD and DLO AD) are related to toxicity and efficacy. 4. Using
data collected in Aims 1-3, develop a pharmacokinetic/dosimetry model that will help guide optimization of αRPT
treatment in human OS patients. New treatments that are fundamentally different from those currently available
are urgently needed for osteosarcoma. Radiopharmaceutical therapy with the highly potent alpha-emitter, 225Ac,
is such a therapy. The proposed studies would yield required data to launch a clinical αRPT trial against OS in
humans."

Metalloproteins carry out many cellular functions that are central to biology and human health, While our
knowledge of how metalloproteins function has grown immensely thanks to technological advances, we still
possess only a superficial understanding of the interplay between protein structure/dynamics and metal
coordination/reactivity, As a result, it has been challenging or even impossible (a) to predict the functional
mechanism of metalloproteins simply by looking at their structures, (b) to emulate or improve upon the structures
and functions of metalloproteins by de nova design, and (c) to understand how complex bioinorganic functions
may have emerged on simple peptide/protein scaffolds during natural evolution, The overarching goal of the
proposed research program is to address these three challenges by designing and constructing protein scaffolds
with complex metal-based functions from scratch, Toward this end, we have recently developed/adapted two
powerful approaches to metalloprotein design, Metal-Centered Protein Assembly (MCPA) and MachineLearning-
guided Design of Metalloproteins (MLDM), which allow novel protein structures to be built around metal
active sites rapidly and with atomic accuracy, In the proposed research, we will further develop these ""metalcentered""
protein design strategies (and establish their generalizability) by constructing de nova protein scaffolds
that will provide access to diverse metal active sites with tunable primary coordination spheres, secondarysphere
environments and global structures/properties that are difficult to attain with other protein design
strategies, We will use these protein scaffolds to build new metalloenzymes for challenging ester, amide and
phospho-ester bond hydrolysis reactions (Specific Aim 1 ), for redox reactions involving dioxygen binding and
activation (Specific Aim 2), and for abiological catalytic transformations (e,g,, hydride and carbene transfer)
(Specific Aim 3), These efforts will uncover fundamental structure-function relationships that govern diverse
metalloprotein activities, lead to better understanding of how bioinorganic complexity arises in simple protein
scaffolds, and furnish new-to-nature reactivities."

Aged individuals, who are often at higher risk of fatality in life-threatening infectious diseases, do not form high-
quality antibodies against new infections. Humoral immunity against infections depends on the germinal center
(GC) differentiation process in the B cell follicles of lymph nodes. In GCs, naïve B cells rapidly proliferate in
response to T cell-dependent antigens and somatically mutate into high-affinity antibody-secreting cells, i.e.,
plasma cells. A significant concern is that with aging, B cells exhibit a decreased expansion of B cells and GC
reaction in response to antigen. However, it is unclear whether this is solely due to immune senescence and a
defect in B cells or the follicular T helper cell (TFH), and whether the lymphoid microenvironment of B cell follicles
plays a role. B cells in young mice assume heterogeneous cell fates upon stimulation, with only a fraction
differentiating into antibody-secreting cells (ASC), however, this phenomenon remains unknown in B cells from
old mice. Notably, plasma cell differentiation in young B cells is controlled by multiple cell division-coupled
epigenetic programs, which also remains understudied in old B cells. Because aged mice cannot generate
sufficient GCs to provide insight into ASC fate and epigenomic remodeling of GC B cells, necessitating the
development of a tissue-engineered model of aged lymphoid tissues. The long-term goals of this R01 are 1) to
develop an ex vivo “aged B cell follicle” organoid technology capable of providing lymphoid microenvironment
signals in a plug-and-play manner to induce early GC programming of aged B cells from mice and human B
cells, therefore enabling the study of plasma cell fate and regulation of the epigenome of B cells; and 2) to
identify checkpoint targets that can be suppressed to boost GC response in aged B cells. PI has
demonstrated that GCs phenotype could be generated in organoids using B cells from >2-yr old mice
when differentiated under young lymphoid microenvironment conditions, however to a lesser extent than
young B cells. However, true differentiation fate of aged B cells ex vivo can only be realized in a
microenvironment representative of old lymph nodes.The R01 is highly significant and innovative because it
will 1) establish lymphoid microenvironment of aged lymph nodes and engineer a hydrogel-based “aged”
immune organoid to study vaccine and infection responses, 2) enable control over the ex vivo B cell
differentiation of aged B cells in ex vivo cultures and generate antigen-specific antibodies against infections,
3) define the cell division kinetics of B cell differentiation and identify the molecular and epigenetic trajectories of
aged B cell fate and ASC formation, and 4) identify checkpoint targets to accelerate GCs in aging."

Chronic alcohol abuse underlies the pathogenesis of alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), encompassed by
a spectrum of pathologies, ranging from steatosis, to more severe forms of liver injury, including alcohol-
associated hepatitis (AH), fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Acute AH has a very high mortality rate, with no effective
therapeutic Patients with AH who exhibit stage 3-4 fibrosis have worse prognosis; however, treatment strategies do
not include therapy for the resolution of fibrosis, representing an important unmet clinical need. Recruitment of innate
immune cells to the liver and the regulation of their phenotype between pro-inflammatory/fibrogenic vs pro-resolution
activity, impacts both disease progression and resolution. Hepatic stellate cells (HSC), the primary producer of
extracellular matrix in the liver, are also regulated by innate immune pathways. During the previous granting cycle,
we discovered that IRF3-dependent pathways, a component of host anti-viral responses, contribute to injury in
murine models of ALD, NAFL/NASH and fibrosis. These data led us to ask the fundamental question: what is the
mechanism by which metabolic/sterile liver diseases activate anti-viral signaling and can this be leveraged to
develop novel therapeutics? We identified perturbations in homeostatic regulation of endogenous dsRNA in both
immune cells and HSCs suggesting that endogenous dsRNAs are novel host-derived DAMPs that activate IRF3
signaling and contribute to the pathogenesis of ALD. IRF3 is classically recognized as a transcription factor
essential for host anti-viral responses, but also has non-transcriptional activities. Using a novel knock-in mouse
expressing an IRF3 protein that only exhibits non-transcriptional functions of IRF3 (Irf3S1/S1), we discovered that
1) IRF3-mediated apoptosis of innate immune cells recruited to the liver in response to Gao-binge ethanol increases
inflammation and liver injury and 2) non-transcriptional functions of IRF3 restricted NFκB activity in a murine model
of NAFL/NASH. Here we propose to extend our studies into IRF3 functions in pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis in
two specific aims: 1) Determine the contribution of the transcriptional and non-transcriptional IRF3 to murine
models of hepatic fibrosis: Using Irf3-/-, Irf3S1/S1 and cell-specific deletions of Irf3, we will test the hypothesis that
non-transcriptional activity of IRF3 contributes to recruitment of neutrophils to liver and enhances activation of
HSCs in mice exposed to CCl4+ethanol or CDAA models of fibrosis. 2) Discover the cell intrinsic functions of
IRF3 in the pathogenesis of fibrosis: Mechanistically, we will identify specific dsRNAs accumulating in cultured
HSCs and neutrophils, interrogate perturbations in expression of RNA chaperones and dsRNA recognition
molecules critical to IRF3 activation in fibrosis. Further, we will interrogate mechanisms for Irf3-dependent cell-
cell interactions in fibrosis using human-iPSC 3-dimensional liver cultures. In summary, our studies will reveal
novel cell-specific roles for non-transcriptional activity of IRF3 in hepatic fibrosis, as well as identify potential
therapeutic targets that would prevent fibrosis and/or improve the resolution of fibrosis in patients with ALD."

The disease malaria is caused by vector-borne parasites of the genus Plasmodium. With hundreds of millions of
infections and over half a million deaths annually, malaria remains one of the foremost global health challenges.
The two WHO-recommended malaria vaccines have only moderate efficacy against severe disease and do not
provide sterilizing protection, neither do they prevent transmission of the parasite to the mosquito vector that
carries it between human hosts. The majority of vaccine development efforts to date have focused on means to
prevent infection of humans. However, a comprehensive malaria eradication effort also requires blocking
transmission with vector-targeted interventions. Compared with vaccines that prevent infection by targeting pre-
erythrocytic and asexual blood stages of the parasite, very few candidate antigens have been identified for
transmission-blocking vaccines (TBVs) that target the transmitted forms of the parasite present in the mosquito
vector stages. This disparity arises in part because the comprehensive characterization of protein expression
that informs vaccines against pre-erythrocytic and asexual blood stages has not been performed for the stages
that develop in the mosquito midgut, i.e., gametes, zygotes, and ookinetes. The few TBV candidates that have
entered clinical trials, including Pfs25, Pfs48/45, and Pfs230, are surface-exposed on these early mosquito-stage
parasites. Importantly, it has been demonstrated that antibodies against these proteins can be generated in the
vertebrate host, carried to the mosquito vector in the blood meal, and subsequently interfere with fertilization
and/or successful infection of the mosquito.
We hypothesize that early mosquito-stage parasites exhibit many more undiscovered surface-exposed proteins,
and that these proteins can be targeted by antibodies to prevent transmission of the malaria parasite to the
mosquito vector. We will use mass spectrometry-based proteomics to provide the first comprehensive catalog
of surface-exposed proteins in P. falciparum gametes, zygotes, and ookinetes. In parallel, we will immunize
animals with early mosquito-stage parasites and identify parasite proteins that elicit an immune response. From
the subset of immunogenic surface-exposed parasite proteins, we will identify the most promising TBV
candidates and evaluate them as antigens for transmission-blocking vaccines by quantifying the ability of
antibodies against these antigens to prevent P. falciparum from infecting mosquitoes."

Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is an autoimmune disease that can present with fever and ataxia
as well as loss of consciousness and coma. ADEM largely affects children and is strongly associated with a prior
infection or immunization. ADEM is driven by T and B lymphocytes aberrantly activated against myelin antigens.
There is no FDA-approved therapy for the treatment of ADEM, and most cases of ADEM are treated with
corticosteroids. Corticosteroids have significant side effects including behavioral changes, hypotension, and
tachycardia and are incompletely effective at treating the disease. ADEM is a rare disease but is associated with
significant morbidity and mortality. Up to 50% of treated ADEM patients fail to fully recover from the disease, and
ADEM has a 5 – 12% mortality rate. Our company, Trethera, is developing a small molecule drug, TRE-515, that
has the potential to selectively block lymphocyte proliferation in ADEM by inhibiting deoxycytidine kinase (dCK),
a key enzyme in the deoxyribonucleoside salvage pathway. Our preliminary studies show in the MOG35-55
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of ADEM that (i) immune cells activate dCK
during disease, (ii) TRE-515 blocks dCK activity in immune cells, (iii) prophylactic or therapeutic TRE-515
treatments block clinical symptoms, (iv) TRE-515 treatments lead to fewer immune cell infiltrates in the central
nervous system, (v) TRE-515 blocks B and T cell proliferation without affecting other immune cell types including
innate immune cells or regulatory T and B cells, (vi) TRE-515 increases plasma deoxycytidine levels suggesting
a potential biomarker for the early evaluation of drug-target engagement, (vii) TRE-515 blocks T cell proliferation
in culture, and (viii) TRE-515 treatments and dCK knockout are not associated with significant toxicities. In
support of and validating these studies, the FDA recently awarded TRE-515 Orphan Drug Designation (ODD)
for the treatment of ADEM. This is the first and only time the FDA has awarded an ODD for the treatment of
ADEM. Additionally, in Phase I clinical trials for solid tumors, TRE-515 treatments are associated with mild side
effects and show evidence of efficacy. Collectively, these data strongly suggest that TRE-515 could be an
important new therapy for ADEM. However, the MOG35-55 EAE model in which we have so far evaluated TRE-
515 is not driven by B cells despite the role of B cells in driving ADEM. In the proposed project, we will conduct
critical preclinical studies to evaluate the effect of TRE-515 in an advanced PLP139-151 EAE model driven by both
B and CD4 T cells. Additionally, to-date all our toxicology studies have been in adult animals but juvenile toxicity
studies are required before we can treat children with ADEM. We will conduct juvenile toxicology studies in mice
to enable us to test TRE-515 in the childhood population in which ADEM predominates. This work will be critical
for moving TRE-515 into the clinical for ADEM patients."
10998038,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Bacteria-host interactions are emerging as critically important mechanisms for cancer progression but are poorly
defined in precancerous colonic dysplasia. Host proteins responsible for maintaining the bacteria-resistant
barrier in the colon can also function as regulators of epithelial cell differentiation and growth, such as Deleted
in Malignant Brain Tumors 1 (DMBT1). DMBT1 is a secreted glycoprotein highly expressed at epithelial barrier
sites in the human gastrointestinal tract. Published data show DMBT1 is upregulated in gastric metaplasia and
gastric adenocarcinoma, but the expression and mechanistic role of DMBT1 in colonic precancerous lesions
is unknown. Recent research suggests DMBT1 slows epithelial proliferation and may inhibit the development of
colorectal cancer (CRC). My preliminary data show the DMBT1 gene is downregulated in distal colonic dysplasia.
Our spatial transcriptomics data reveals downregulated DMBT1 expression in dysplastic foci compared with
normal colonocytes. In mouse colon tissue, I use immunofluorescence to characterize DMBT1 protein
expression. The DMBT1 staining is predominantly in mid-crypt colonocytes with cytoplasmic localization and
enhanced staining near the apical border. I further show DMBT1 expression in 3 different mouse models of CRC:
azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate, C. difficile-associated tumorigenesis in Apcmin, and Lrig1CreER/+;Apcfl/+
mice. In 100% of the dysplastic foci (n = 57 foci from 11 mice), the immunofluorescent staining of DMBT1 protein
is reduced in precise correlation with upregulated β-catenin. Analysis of DMBT1 expression in human CRC
samples, including tissue microarrays containing early dysplasia, shows DMBT1 protein localization and
abundance correlates with disease progression. Specifically, more advanced pathologies correlate with DMBT1
loss or secretion. Based on my preliminary data and published literature, it appears DMBT1 may function as a
tumor suppressor specifically acting in early CRC dysplasia. Previous studies show DMBT1 is transcriptionally
regulated via canonical innate immune signaling pathways (e.g. NF-κB, STAT3) in infection and inflammatory
bowel disease. However, the critical pathways mediating DMBT1 downregulation in colonic dysplasia are
unknown. My hypothesis is that reduced DMBT1 expression in colonic dysplasia is transcriptionally
regulated and provides a selective advantage for tumorigenesis through hyperproliferation and altered
cell polarity. To test this, I will determine the timeline and mechanism of DMBT1 loss using CRC mouse models
and biochemical and genetic manipulations of cellular pathways commonly dysregulated in CRC (Aim 1), and I
will determine how loss of DMBT1 might be advantageous for tumor development in CRC by establishing DMBT1
knockout (DMBT1 -/- ) cells, human organoids, and a DMBT1 -/- CRC mouse model. Potentially, the loss of DMBT1
staining may aid with clinically distinguishing dysplasia from reactive changes in inflammatory bowel disease
and provide a biomarker for early dysplastic transformation in human CRC."

There is a critical need to develop therapies targeting Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn): a major human
pathogen contributing to global morbidity and mortality. We propose to use Specifically Targeted Anti-Microbial
Peptides (STAMPs), where a broad spectrum anti-microbial peptide (AMP) is fused to a Spn secreted peptide.
The former will provide anti-microbial activity, while the latter will impart selectivity of this activity at the taxonomic
level or increase efficacy of the AMP. This project builds on preliminary data where we show that human beta-
defensin 3 is ineffective in killing Spn. In contrast, a fusion of this AMP to a Spn cell-cell communication peptide
resulted in a peptide that eliminated >95% of Spn in culture. Further, we propose an innovative way to produce
STAMP peptides, where we will deploy a “molecular velcro” technology based on complementary peptide nucleic
acid (PNA) adapters. These PNA adapters are connected to the ends of independent targeting and AMP domains,
allowing facile assembly and screening of PNA-STAMP libraries. Conclusion of the proposed work will introduce
species-specific antimicrobials for Spn targeting and develop a conceptual and technical platform for the
development of Gram-positive antimicrobials."

Insulin-binding B lymphocytes contribute to type 1 diabetes (T1D) through B cell receptor (BCR) recognition of
insulin and autoantigen presentation to T lymphocytes in the mouse model of T1D. Insulin is a key autoantigen
targeted by B and T lymphocytes in human and murine T1D. Heterogeneity in diabetes onset and response to
immunotherapy in humans has significantly hindered development of successful T1D immunotherapies. The
first immunotherapy for T1D was recently approved, yet responses were incomplete and non-durable.
Therefore, a better understanding of how immune cells implicated in pathology arise and evolve with T1D
progression is critical to improve immunotherapy development in the future. A major knowledge gap exists
regarding how insulin-binding B lymphocytes acquire insulin reactivity and persist in the repertoire to support
T1D pathology. Autoreactive BCRs are often polyreactive against other antigens, but the functional
consequence of this polyreactivity, and how it changes with autoimmune disease progression, is not clear. My
preliminary data show 67% of stage 1 at-risk T1D B cell receptors (BCRs) were polyreactive, which dropped to
29% in stage 2 at-risk T1D BCRs measured by Hep-2 reactivity. When the only amino acid mutation in one
anti-insulin BCR was reverted back to germline, the insulin-binding area under the curve (AUC) was reduced
by ~84%. In contrast, germline reversion of 22 amino acid mutations in another anti-insulin BCR resulted in
only an ~11% reduction in AUC. Therefore, I hypothesize that insulin-binding B lymphocytes in at-risk T1D
individuals will lose polyreactivity with disease progression and increased BCR somatic hypermutation, but the
number of BCR mutations will not correlate with increased affinity for insulin. To test this hypothesis, I will take
advantage of our unique Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet cohort, which consists of 2+ islet autoantibody-positive
participants across three stages of T1D: Stage 1 (normal oral glucose tolerance), Stage 2 (impaired glucose
tolerance), and new-onset Stage 3 (clinical diabetes), all of whom are insulin therapy-naive. I will use advanced
human hybridoma technology that can capture rare antigen-specific B lymphocytes in peripheral blood, in
combination with single cell technology, to identify insulin-binding B lymphocytes from at-risk individuals. I will
investigate how affinity and polyreactivity shift across disease stages and with increased BCR somatic
hypermutation. These studies will build a foundational understanding of B lymphocyte recognition of insulin, a
major T1D autoantigen, and will clarify the impact of affinity maturation on this recognition. These findings will
identify insulin-binding B lymphocyte changes that can be monitored as early indicators of immunotherapy
response in the future to improve clinical trial evaluation and inform clinical management. The technical skills
and professional development proposed in this training plan, paired with strong, multidisciplinary mentorship,
will support my future career goal to be an independent scientist and leader in immunotherapy design."

Utilizing effective evidence- and asset-based approaches in mentorship are essential to improving the
success of trainees from diverse backgrounds in STEMM and biomedical/behavioral research. While the
scholarship has noted the benefits of asset-based and culturally responsive mentoring approaches, few
opportunities exist to gather like-minded individuals to learn and discuss practical ways of moving the
research to practice. Moreover, limited resources and opportunities exist on how institutions and organ-
izations can institutionalize culturally responsive mentoring approaches using asset-based practices. As
such, we proposed a conference with the theme “Broadening Biomedical Research Workforce Partici-
pation through Culturally Responsive Mentoring” to be held on January 23-24, 2025 (intentionally
selected to align with January mentoring month) in Fort Worth, TX. The overarching goal of this proposed
conference is to impart to attendees an integrated understanding of asset-based culturally responsive
mentoring approaches that can be used in STEMM and biomedical/behavioral research paces to enhance
participation in the biomedical workforce and train the next generation of scientists. The conference will
feature educational and interactive presentations, panel and round table discussions, breakout sessions,
and networking facilitated by nationwide experts in asset-based and culturally responsive mentoring
approaches, DEIA, and organizational culture and change. Further, the conference will provide
opportunities for networking beyond the conference through a virtual Community of Practice, as well as
access to a national Resource. The audience will consist of nationwide individuals (approximately 500
participants) from multi-tier levels including an audience of leadership, policymakers, NIH-funded Program
Directors, mentors, administrators, and mentees within the STEMM and biomedical/ behavioral research
space. The Specific Aims of the conference are these: 1) Enhance the understanding of asset-based
culturally responsive mentoring approaches across career stages to enhance participation in the
biomedical workforce and train the next generation of scientists; 2) Create a Community of Practice to
engage in collaboration and networking surrounding culturally responsive mentoring practices to enhance
participation in the biomedical workforce. 3) Develop and disseminate nationwide an Enhancing Biomedical
Research Workforce Participation through Culturally Responsive Mentoring Resource. The expected
outcome is to increase understanding of practical approaches for conducting mentoring in an intentional
and structural way, using asset-based and culturally responsive approaches, as a means to enhance
participation in the biomedical workforce and train the next generation of scientists."

 The heart requires a constant supply of ATP to meet its high energy demands and maintain its contractile
function. The relationship between cardiac energy deficiency and heart failure has been extensively studied,
leading to various strategies to improve energy deficiency in heart failure. However, despite these efforts,
limitations persist, and the energy deficit in failing hearts remains. A more comprehensive understanding that
moves beyond our current linear model of energy production and consumption is needed to address this
challenge. In this project, the investigators proposed exploring the metabolic resuscitation system, a revival
mechanism profoundly downregulated in heart failure patients. The overarching objective of this program is to
determine the connection between a compromised metabolic resuscitation system and the pathogenesis of
heart failure and revival. Comprehensive experimental approaches and patient-related genetic animal models
are applied to investigate this new system. The eventual results will allow a look from a different angle to
understand the progression of HF. Manipulating the novel factors in this system could be a novel therapeutic
strategy and potential new biomarkers for heart failure treatment and prevention, eventually improving heart
failure patient outcomes. The project expects to achieve three main objectives: defining the functional and
pathological significance of this system in the heart, uncovering the regulation of this resuscitative mechanism,
and exploring its translational potential for preventing and treating heart failure patients."

Emotional arousal is a key bio-behavioral target for investigations of transdiagnostic mechanisms underlying the
development of pathological emotional states (e.g., anxiety, depression, irritability). While arousal is different
from valence (positive or negative affect), arousal creates a readiness for valenced states, and its temporal and
magnitude properties dictate the nature of experienced emotions. Arousal is one of the first affective states to
emerge developmentally, and it is highly susceptible to stress exposures; therefore, delineating trajectories of
psychopathology associated with arousal requires a developmental approach. As central as phasic changes in
arousal are to healthy emotional functioning, reliably and objectively studying emotional arousal across the first
two decades of life is challenging because existing probes may not be appropriate for use across a wide range
of ages. The current proposal develops a straight-forward, controlled, and standardized tool – a looming auditory
stimulus – to measure phasic changes in arousal to provide a common metric that can be used across
development and diverse designs and settings. The work in the proposal will measure the looming task’s
psychometric properties during pupillometry, autonomic responses (HR, SCR), and behavioral ratings. Then we
will assess how these measures track affect-related psychopathology (anxiety, depression, irritability) during
development. Finally, we will identify associations between arousal-induced brain function and affect-related
psychopathological symptoms during development. Aim I establishes validity and reliability of a simple arousal
task from the preschool period through young adulthood (2-25 years). Aim II assesses how arousal tracks
individual differences in psychopathology symptoms (anxiety, depression, irritability) in a high-risk developmental
sample. Aim III identifies the associations between arousal-related brain function and psychopathological
symptoms (anxiety, depression, irritability) during development."

With the increasing awareness of distinct disease outcomes during polymicrobial infections, there is an urgent
need for mechanistic studies to better define microbial interactions. This application seeks to understand
community interactions between Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, which are model
organisms to study polymicrobial interactions. They are two of the most common pathogens causing chronic
infections in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis (CF), medical devices, and wounds, suggesting co-
existence in vivo. Indeed, chronic co-infections caused by these organisms are more problematic than mono-
species infections. However, the relationship between P. aeruginosa and S. aureus is intriguingly complicated.
These organisms often compete in vitro but are frequently co-isolated from the same clinical samples. We
contribute to the studies of anti-S. aureus mechanisms by proposing a novel role for the P. aeruginosa
exopolysaccharide Psl in antagonizing S. aureus growth and interactions with S. aureus protein A (SpA).
Studies proposed in aim 1 will utilize several complementary strategies to define mechanisms underlying P.
aeruginosa Psl-mediated interactions with S. aureus. In aim 2, we will investigate a unique cooperative
behavior associated with P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. This involves production of 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline
N-oxide (HQNO) by P. aeruginosa, and staphyloxanthin (STX), a yellow pigment synthesized by the S. aureus
crt operon. STX can promote S. aureus resistance to oxidative stress and neutrophil-mediated killing. We
found that STX production in S. aureus, either as surface-grown macrocolonies or planktonic cultures, was
elevated when exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of HQNO. When subjected to hydrogen peroxide, human
neutrophils, or during in vivo infections, P. aeruginosa survival was significantly higher when mixed with wild-
type S. aureus, in comparison to P. aeruginosa cultured alone or with an S. aureus crt mutant deficient in STX
production. Therefore, the focus of aim 2 will be to define the pathways and biological relevance of HQNO-
mediated induction of STX, resulting in resistance to host ROS during infection. Finally, we discovered that a
prior infection of both human- and murine-derived macrophages with S. aureus induces tolerance and prevents
responsiveness to subsequent infection. This is due to significant metabolic rewiring of the macrophage innate
immune response during primary infection. Thus, aim 3 will use primary macrophages and in vivo animal
models to investigate how a S. aureus infection leads to metabolic reprogramming and define how this leads to
epigenetic changes and subsequent innate immune gene silencing. P. aeruginosa and S. aureus interactions
are clearly multifaceted and likely mediated by bacterial factors, spatial distribution during infection, nutrient
availability, and the host microenvironment. These proposed studies will contribute to the understanding of
complex polymicrobial interactions and lay the foundation for strategies to modulate these pathways for better
control of mixed-species infections."

muscle, 2) maximizing spread of editing enzymes across nuclei of the myofiber syncytium, 3) avoiding sustained
expression of editing enzymes, and 4) integrating solutions to each of these problems in a single AAV so as to
minimize total viral dose required. Given that exciting new myotropic capsids that have emerged in the literature,
this proposal is primarily focused on addressing the latter 3 issues. We have previously developed ways to
shuttle Cas enzymes throughout myofibers and now propose to use creative new approaches that rely on tried-
and-true mechanisms to access and edit even more myonuclei in skeletal muscle. We have also developed ways
to use small molecules to control AAV-delivered gene expression and propose to further develop this technology
to achieve fully “off” transgene states with maximally “on” states when desired, so that Cas enzyme expression
can be turned off when no longer needed. Finally, we will integrate these technologies with the latest miniaturized
Cas enzymes and package all components, including guide RNAs, into a single AAV vector. We will test
approaches in mouse models of myotonic dystrophy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Ultimately, the insights
we make here will be apply to gene editing for any skeletal muscle disease and enable the next generation of
therapies for muscular dystrophies."

 Vertebrate eggs lie dormant until fertilized, when a process called egg activation ensues that triggers the
completion of meiosis and other processes that initiate embryonic development. These processes occur within
the first several minutes after fertilization and depend on maternal factors supplied by the mother to the egg
during oogenesis. Maternal factors exclusively drive early embryonic development in all animals, since the
zygotic genome is not activated until at least one and typically several cell division cycles after fertilization. The
large maternal contribution to vertebrate embryonic development is evident by the large size of eggs and early
embryos compared to somatic cells (~10 to 1000 times greater, depending on the species). Moreover, unique
features of this stage of development, such as acentrosomal meiotic divisions and mitotic spindles that cannot
scale to the large cell sizes, necessitate unique maternal functions, not found in somatic cells. However, the
roles that maternal factors play and how their vast supply is regulated spatiotemporally in the large egg and early
embryo is little studied, despite its importance in reproductive success and fertility. The zebrafish provides an
excellent model for studying the maternal regulation of development in vertebrates. Many maternally-regulated
gene functions are conserved between zebrafish and mammals. Zebrafish eggs are externally fertilized, so are
easily accessible, and their large size and translucency is advantageous for live imaging with fluorescent
markers, which will be profited from here. A key event in egg activation is the completion of meiosis. At the end
of oogenesis in vertebrates, the mature oocyte and egg are arrested in metaphase of meiosis II. The second
meiotic division ensues when the egg is activated, thus generating the second polar body and a haploid
complement of chromosomes to contribute to the zygote. Meiotic divisions are unique in oocytes and eggs as
they lack the centrosome, the primary microtubule organizing center (MTOC) of a cell. While the meiotic
acentrosomal MTOC (aMTOC) proteome has recently been described, little is known about how acentrosomal
spindles are regulated and what normally restricts their nucleation in time and space. Here a zebrafish maternal-
effect mutant named volcán will be studied, which displays multiple ectopic spindle-like MTs in the single cell
blastodisc that cause a novel defect, the generation of numerous vesicle-like structures at the animal pole
potentially polar body-like structures, but devoid of DNA. The dynamics, etiology in development, and nature of
the spindle-like MT and vesicle-like structures abrogated by Volcan will be investigated, as well as the molecular
nature of the volcan gene. The results of these Aims are expected to reveal the molecular identity of a key protein
acting to restrict formation or organization of aMTOC spindle MTs in the egg to ensure a single polar body-like
structure is extruded and that the egg is competent for embryonic development. These studies have direct
relevance to reproductive success and women's fertility, including potential targets for infertility treatments."

The long-term objective of this project is to engineer a new generation of safer and more effective breast 
cancer nanomedicines that improve drug delivery to tumors by efficiently overcoming the blood-tumor barrier via 
transcytosis. As a first step, we propose to establish a new ultrastructural 3D super-resolution optical imaging 
platform to track and quantify in a label-free manner the intracellular nanoparticle transport and transcytosis. 
Nanoparticle transcytosis is a novel delivery pathway in cancer nanomedicine and may occur through two major 
intracellular routes: (1) vesicle mediated intracellular transport, and (2) shuttling of nanoparticles via intracellular 
tubules. However, it is unknown which pathway results in more efficient nanoparticle transcytosis and whether 
these routes favor specific nanoparticle sizes to date. To differentiate between the vesicle and tubule-mediated 
nanoparticle transport routes, ultrastructural 3D imaging of whole endothelial cells is needed. Our objective is to 
establish a 3D super-resolution optical microscopy as a novel and unique method to understand the intracellular 
pathways that nanoparticles take during transcytosis. Using our unique label-fee 3D super-resolution imaging 
approach, we will test the hypothesis that nanoparticle size will determine the nanoparticle transcytosis pathway 
and transcytosis efficiency in breast-cancer associated endothelial cells. For this purpose, we propose the 
following two Specific Aims. Aim 1 is to establish 3D super-resolution optical microscopy of breast-cancer 
associated endothelial cells in combination with label-free nanoparticle imaging. Aim 2 is to quantify nanoparticle 
transcytosis in human breast cancer associated endothelial cells. In order to optimally conduct the proposed 
research tasks and pursue the success of this project, the research project leader (RPL) has two experienced 
mentors and also assembled a multidisciplinary research team with unique and synergistic expertise in the 
nanomedicine, tumor vascular biology, super-resolution microscopy, and breast oncology. This project will 
comprehensively investigate a unique imaging approach as a platform technology that can be applied to visualize 
and study the nanoparticle transport in different tissues and cells in 3D at ultrastructural resolution using 
conventional optical microscopes. As a result, using this novel imaging method can help design and implement 
the optimal nanoparticle properties for intracellular nanoparticle transport and transcytosis to significantly 
improve efficacy of the drug delivery to tumor tissues in cancer treatment. Success of this project will provide the 
essential preliminary study data and scientific evidence to support the RPL to apply for the NIH R01 project (i.e.,
PAR-20-284 – Innovative Research in Cancer Nanomedicine) in the future."
11000545,"The American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) is the largest professional, scientific and medical
society established to bring together clinical and laboratory-based investigators who are involved in the study of
bone, mineral and musculoskeletal disorders. Since 2002, the ASBMR has held one-day symposia preceding
the society Annual Meeting that were funded by an R13 grant, tackled a specific topic and were very successful.
Based on that strength, the ASBMR subsequently received 3-year R13 grants to systematically organize topical
symposia for 2016-2018, 2019-2021 and 2022-2024. In that vein, the present application seeks a 3-year R13
grant to organize annual one-day symposia on Rare Bone Diseases, in partnership with the Rare Bone Disease
Alliance. This is a critical and compelling field of research in urgent need of basic, transitional and clinical
advances. The 2024, 2025 and 2026 symposia will respectively focus on: 1) “Exploring and Expanding
Treatments and Analytical Tools in Rare Bone Diseases”; 2) “From the Genome to the Lived Experience”; 3) “A
Review of the Rapidly Changing Landscape in Rare Disease Therapeutics”. The three symposia cover most
pressing and timely areas of musculoskeletal research that are undergoing rapid advances in scientific
knowledge and address disorders with major clinical morbidity, disability and mortality. The overall objective of
this R13 is to share and discuss most recent findings and envision paths to translation and clinical testing of new
therapies, with the goal of improving care of patients with rare bone diseases. The symposia will gather the best
researchers, present state-of-the-art findings in each topic area, foster interactions and collaborations between
young and established investigators, and chart future goals and directions. The symposia will also provide a
forum to learn of novel strategies pursued in other research fields and their potential to expand rare bone disease
research and therapeutic horizons. Symposia attendees will be encouraged to stay and take part in the Annual
Meeting to further interact with musculoskeletal researchers, establish additional connections and learn from
common bone diseases. Programs for all three symposia were developed by an organizing committee, and
speakers for the first two symposia have confirmed their participation. Presenters will include established and
young investigators, women and men, and national and international participants. There will be poster sessions
and preference will be given to young investigators to present their abstract orally to further facilitate and
encourage direct interactions between young and senior investigators. The 2024 symposium will discuss latest
advances on the pathogenesis and potential treatments of rare bone diseases and will explore novel therapeutic
strategies and future analytical tools by including experts from academia, industry and government entities. In
2025, the symposium will go from bench to bedside and feature an array of speakers who will be covering topics
that span the genome to the patient voice through their lived experiences. The 2026 symposium will review the
rapidly changing landscape of rare bone disease therapeutics and feature a diverse group of speakers including
patients, researchers from academia and industry, and government officials."

Genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections
worldwide. The infection is lifelong: there currently is no cure and no vaccine. In addition, HSV-1 and -2,
human papillomavirus (HPV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are responsible for intersecting
epidemics, where the disease caused by one virus facilitates the transmission and/or pathogenesis of the
other. Numerous studies suggest that user-controlled multipurpose products providing HSV prevention –ideally
along with HPV and HIV– in combination with contraception would strongly motivate higher uptake relative to
single-purpose products: women not self-identifying as at risk of HSV infection would use a multipurpose
product to avoid pregnancy, resulting in significantly improved user compliance, and hence effectiveness,
relative to single-purpose antiviral products. Many women would prefer a topical (vaginal) nonhormonal
contraception method that, unlike vaginal gels, does not require use immediately before or after sex. Our
application integrates key innovations in developing a next generation multipurpose technology (MPT)
intravaginal ring (IVR) comprised of: (1) antiviral peptide lead candidate with activity against HSV, HPV, and
HIV; (2) small-molecule inhibitors of sperm functions required to reach and fertilize the oocyte; and (3) a novel
IVR platform for long-acting, controlled delivery of the two-drug combination. We have designed and
synthesized a library of small antiviral peptides that disrupt a range of viruses, including HSV, HPV, and HIV, at
low µM concentrations. An existing lead candidate, optimized for vaginal delivery, has been selected for IVR
formulation under the current application. In parallel, we have designed and synthesized a library of highly
potent, small-molecule inhibitors of soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) that effectively block sperm motility and
prevent in vitro fertilization at sub nM concentrations. Finally, our team developed an innovative IVR platform
for the delivery of drug combinations, including small molecules and biomolecules, at independently controlled
rates. In Aim 1, we will evaluate our panel of sAC inhibitor late-lead candidates using biochemical, functional,
and pharmacological assays to select a lead candidate designed specifically for vaginal dosing. In Aim 2, we
will formulate and evaluate in vitro human-sized MPT IVRs to deliver our lead antiviral peptide and lead
contraceptive combinations at target in vitro rates. In Aim 3, we will assess the pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics (safety and anti-HSV efficacy) of MPT IVR candidates in mice (efficacy and preliminary
safety) and sheep (pharmacokinetics and safety). This project builds on an established collaboration of
investigators and will advance our scientific knowledge on vaginal delivery of novel agents in the context of
HSV prevention and nonhormonal contraception."

 Lupus nephritis (LN) is a highly debilitating disease associated with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
(SLE, lupus). >40% of lupus patients develop LN and many progress to end stage kidney disease (ESKD).
Thus, LN remains the strongest predictor of morbidity and mortality in lupus patients. LN is currently
managed with aggressive immunosuppressive and cytotoxic agents that have considerable side effects
and long-term toxicity. Therefore improved, targeted new treatments are urgently needed. Uncontrolled
toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling in myeloid cells results in their overactivity and produces a feed-forward
cycle of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as type I interferon (IFN I), IL-6, IL-1b and soluble uPAR
(suPAR). IFN I is increased in sera of LN patients, and suPAR is a circulating risk factor for glomerular
diseases, including LN. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ITGAM gene (coding for integrin
CD11b) are found in ~20% of LN patients and produce dysfunctional CD11b. We found that 1) these SNPs
not only show strong correlation with the incidence of LN (and SLE), but are also associated with
significantly higher levels of IFN I and suPAR in LN patient sera; and that 2) CD11b is a natural regulator
of uncontrolled TLR signaling, and the variant CD11b is especially ineffective in controlling the TLR
pathways in myeloid cells. To address this deficiency, we developed a novel, highly selective CD11b
agonist small molecule, termed ONTEGIMOD, that activates both wildtype and mutant CD11b and
reduces uncontrolled TLR-signaling in vitro and in vivo. It also reduces myeloid infiltration in inflamed
kidneys. New data in multiple LN murine models also shows that oral ONTEGIMOD therapeutically
reduces serum IFN I, anti-dsDNA antibody and suPAR levels, reduces myeloid influx in kidneys,
decreases albuminuria and protects against kidney injury in LN. Therefore, we propose that CD11b
activation, by rescuing the functional deficit in CD11b and thereby suppressing TLR-dependent
inflammatory signaling, will provide us with a new therapeutic for LN. Direct proof of ONTEGIMOD’s
potential as a LN therapeutic requires a new clinical trial in LN patients. Here, we propose such a pilot,
mechanistic clinical trial and propose three aims. First, we plan to use ex vivo assays to identify LN
patients most likely to respond to CD11b activator ONTEGIMOD, especially patients homozygous for
ITGAM SNPs, thereby developing a personalized therapeutic approach. We also plan to perform a Phase
I/II clinical trial to generate preliminary evidence of safety, tolerability and efficacy of ONTEGIMOD in LN
patients. Finally, we plan to define molecular changes in sera and in circulating immune cells from
ONTEGIMOD treated LN patients. Successful completion of our pilot trial will generate crucial preliminary
evidence for a larger, placebo-controlled efficacy trial in the future to help develop it as a novel, first-in-
class, oral LN therapeutic."
10980237,"Pulmonary hypertension (PH) represents a grave and relentless medical condition, characterized
clinically by elevated pulmonary arterial pressure and augmented pulmonary vascular resistance
(PVR). This pathophysiological state inevitably progresses to the development of right ventricular
(RV) hypertrophy (RVH), culminating in RV failure, and ultimately, mortality. Moreover, PH could
be a confounding complication of chronic lung pathology particularly secondary to interstitial lung
disease (ILD), including its severe type- Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The primary driver of
increased PVR in ILD-PH, similarly as in other PH subtypes, is pulmonary vascular remodeling,
a complex process involving various cells in pulmonary arterial wall. However, the progression of
PH from ILD remains largely unknown. Recently, the first inhaled vasoactive drug-treprostinil was
approved for treating ILD-PH. However, concerns about its potential side effects and high costs
highlight the urgent need for innovative strategies to manage ILD-PH. Unfortunately, there is
currently no treatment specifically designed to target vascular remodeling in ILD-PH.
Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-binding endothelial regulator (BMPER) is highly expressed in
the lung; however, our understanding about its role in lung diseases is very limited. BMPER is a
secreted regulator that regulates vascular development via fine-tuning the BMP pathway. BMP
plays a pivotal role in the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Animal models
targeting BMP pathway components (i.e. BMPR2, Gremlin1) also illuminate their regulatory
functions in other forms of PH, including that associated with ILD. However, the role of BMPER
has not been studied in any forms of PH. In this study, we will define a new and lung-specific
paracrine regulatory mechanism mediated via BMPER for vascular remodeling during the
progression of ILD-PH. First, we will define the transcriptional regulation of BMPER during the
progression of ILD-PH. Next, we will establish mechanisms governing BMPER regulation of
pulmonary vascular remodeling. Last, we will assess the tissue-specific BMPER expression in the
development of vasculopathy in patients with ILD-PH."

Humans with normal hearing excel at deriving information about the world from sound. Our auditory abilities
represent stunning computational feats that only recently have been replicated to any extent in machine systems.
And yet our auditory abilities are highly vulnerable, being greatly compromised in listeners with hearing
impairment, cochlear implants, and auditory neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly in the presence of noise.
Difficulties in recognition often lead to frustration and social isolation, and are not adequately addressed by
current hearing aids, implants, and remediation strategies. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to
build models that replicate our abilities to recognize and localize sounds, and to use these models to facilitate
improved prosthetic devices and therapeutic interventions. The development of more effective devices and
therapies is currently limited by an incomplete understanding of the link between peripheral auditory processing
and auditory behavior. We propose to leverage machine learning to build models that instantiate this link by
performing realistic tasks given simulated peripheral auditory input, and to evaluate the models with large-scale
behavioral assays. Aim 1 will build models of recognition and localization of real-world sounds, and compare
them to human recognition and localization judgments. Aim 2 will augment these models with selective attention,
and compare them to human performance on recognition and localization tasks that require selective attention.
Aim 3 will introduce different types of simulated hearing loss to these models and attempt to isolate distinct
behavioral signatures of different types of hearing loss. The research will generate models that can predict
human auditory behavior along with new behavioral benchmarks with which to evaluate these and future models.
The results will clarify the role of peripheral auditory processing in real-world auditory abilities, setting the stage
for new strategies for remediation."

Emotions play a critical role in organizing human experience and behavior, and emotion dysregulation lies
at the heart of psychopathology and functional impairment across disorders. To measure and understand
emotion dysregulation, advances in understanding the fundamentals of how the brain generates and
represents emotional states are vitally needed. This proposal develops and validates brain models underlying
emotional states in naturalistic, narrative contexts. We combine Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(fMRI), multimodal latent factor models, natural language processing, and pattern recognition techniques
to develop models of brain activity that characterize how individuals generate emotional experiences. Over
the previous project period, we have developed several technical innovations to identify dynamic
emotional states from multimodal data and how they vary moment-by-moment during fMRI scanning.
These models allow different individuals to experience and express latent emotional states at different
times, accounting for the idiosyncratic interpretations of events that are a hallmark of human emotional
responses. We elicit emotional experiences using dynamic, naturalistic movies and autobiographical
stories. In Experiment 1, we infer latent emotional states using a novel application of the Shared Response
Model (SRM), a latent factor model that integrates multiple simultaneously acquired measurement
modalities including: moment-by-moment subjective ratings inferred using an innovative collaborative
filtering approach, automatically decoded facial expressions using computer vision techniques, and
psychophysiological signals. We then use these emotion signals to identify distributed patterns of brain
activity that track distinct emotional states. In Experiment 2, we characterize how cortical-subcortical
circuits involved in appraisal–and particularly the ventromedial prefrontal cortex–generate
interpretations of unfolding events that give rise to emotional experiences. We leverage high-dimensional
semantic embeddings of participants’ appraisals as revealed by a think-aloud protocol. The resulting brain
models of specific emotion categories afford several potentially transformative advantages. Such models
can (a) provide insight into which systems are necessary and sufficient for emotion generation; (b) be
shared and tested across studies, allowing us to evaluate their generalizability across contexts; and (c)
provide targets for psychological and neurological interventions.
Together, these studies will yield generalizable models of the dynamic brain patterns underlying specific
emotional experiences. Such models could transform the study of emotion by providing ways of
capturing the moment-by-moment dynamics of emotional states, and clinical research by allowing
investigators to test effects of psychological interventions on brain targets related to specific emotions."

We have identified a highly tumor specific cell surface antigen, ALPPL2 or ALPG, that is not expressed in any
normal tissue except for the placenta. ALPPL2 is expressed in a number of cancers including mesothelioma,
ovarian, lung, gastric, pancreatic, endometrioma, and testicular cancer. ALPPL2 is one of those rare cell
surface antigens that are genuinely tumor specific as opposed to tumor associated. The exquisite tissue
specificity makes ALPPL2 an attractive target for developing cancer therapies that require a high degree of
specificity. We propose to develop an ALPPL2-targeted bispecific T cell engager for treatment of ALPPL2
positive cancers. Target specificity is the hallmark of our new therapy development effort. In addition, we will
engineer the CD3 arm: (1) a low affinity CD3 arm has the potential of reducing target independent cytokine
release and thus gaining a wider therapeutic window; (2) tumor killing and cytokine release are mediated by
two thresholds that can be differentially impacted by CD3 arm engineering. A mild or minimal on-target
cytokine release is desired. Another important variable that affects developability and therapeutic window is the
molecular architecture on which the bispecific is constructed. In this proposal, we will address the three critical
issues, i.e., target specificity, CD3 arm optimization, and molecular architecture, and use a system engineering
approach to identify an optimized T cell engager with matching components and forms that impart it with an
excellent developability and a wide therapeutic window, enabling translation to clinical testing. In Aim 1, we will
generate ALPPL2 BiTEs with engineered CD3 arm variants in forms compatible with clinical translation. In Aim
2, we will study tumor-specific cytotoxicity and cytokine release of system-engineered BiTEs targeting the true
tumor specific antigen ALPPL2. In Aim 3, we will determine efficacy in vivo and identify a lead ALPPL2 BiTE
for clinical translation. Impact: Successful completion of the proposed study will lead directly to clinical
translation of a novel bispecific T cell engager with unprecedented tumor targeting specificity in multiple
incurable cancer types with dire clinical needs."
10982270,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of genetic loci linked to complex
traits, but determining the causal variants, target genes, and biological mechanisms responsible for each signal
remains challenging. While traditionally GWAS has focused on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the
advent of biobank-scale next-generation sequencing datasets as well as advanced functional genomics
techniques now enable systematic interrogation of the role of more complex variants in polygenic traits.
 We focus on the role of genetic variation at repetitive regions of the genome. Specifically, we consider
two repeat types: short tandem repeats (STRs), consisting of repeated motifs of 1-6bp, and variable number
tandem repeats (VNTRs), with motifs of 7+bp, which we collectively refer to as tandem repeats (TRs). TRs exhibit
rapid mutation rates that render them one of the largest sources of genetic variation in humans. Increasing
evidence suggests that TRs act as an important source of causal variants for complex traits and may drive some
of the strongest GWAS signals identified to date. Yet, due to bioinformatic and experimental challenges in
studying repeats, the genome-wide role of TRs on complex human traits is only beginning to be uncovered.
 We hypothesize that TR variants are key drivers of complex traits. We recently published the first
genome-wide integration of TRs into the GWAS framework. This identified 93 STRs predicted to causally impact
blood and serum biomarker traits and estimated STRs explain 5-10% of GWAS signals for these traits. We have
experimentally interrogated the effects of thousands of promoter TRs by optimizing a massively parallel reporter
assays (MPRA) to enable studying low-complexity sequences. Using our MPRA we were able to show
widespread and cell-type specific TR effects on expression.
 While these findings offer intriguing evidence that thousands of TRs contribute to human phenotypes,
they have been limited by the range of TRs that could be accurately imputed into available GWAS datasets and
the biological mechanisms by which TRs affect complex traits remains unknown in most cases. Here, we
leverage (i) newly available whole genome sequencing (WGS) for hundreds of thousands of individuals from UK
Biobank (UKB) and All of Us (AoU) which will enable direct TR genotyping rather than imputation, (ii) a suite of
computational tools we have developed for population-scale TR analysis and association testing, and (iii) our
recently developed MPRA and genome editing frameworks for experimental interrogation of TR effects to
systematically evaluate the contribution of TRs to complex traits in humans. Using these, we will develop scalable
methods to perform TR-based GWAS in large biobanks to generate a comprehensive catalog of TRs associated
with complex traits (Aim 1), use MPRA to investigate the effects of tens of thousands of TRs on gene regulation
(Aim 2) and perform deep characterization of candidate medically relevant TRs in induced pluripotent stem cells
and their differentiated derivatives in cell lines originating from ancestrally diverse donors (Aim 3)."

The primary focus of this research proposal is the refinement and advanced optimization of the
Non-Invasive Venous waveform Analysis for Heart Failure (NIVAHF) device, building upon the
foundational achievements made under R01HL148244. This device represents a pioneering
stride in the field of cardiology, offering the potential for accurate, non-invasive monitoring of
volume status, which is paramount for heart failure patients. The advancements made in recent
years have rendered a significant shift in our understanding of venous waveforms, leading to the
development of this revolutionary monitoring tool--NIVAHF. This tool, at its core, employs an AI
neural network algorithm to generate a NIVA Score, a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure
(PCWP) equivalent value. This renewal looks to investigate and confront three major limitations
found with venous waveform analysis in heart failure patients: tricuspid regurgitation (TR), those
having undergone orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT), and those supported by a left
ventricular assist device (LVAD). The prevalence of TR in heart failure patients, due to
hemodynamic changes, makes it an essential marker of disease severity. Heart transplant
recipients are particularly vulnerable, requiring continuous monitoring to detect early signs of
graft dysfunction or rejection. Similarly, for LVAD-supported patients, consistent PCWP
monitoring becomes a cornerstone for optimal care, as it helps in reducing complications and
enhancing overall health outcomes. To address the complex challenges associated with venous
waveform analysis, our research advances a multifaceted approach. Initially, we will delve into
characterizing the intricate relationship between TR severity and the NIVA Score by harnessing
an expansive database and analysis plan. This endeavor aims to recalibrate the device's
precision for patients exhibiting different stages of TR. Concurrently, understanding the criticality
of post-transplant surveillance, we will lay the groundwork for an OHT specific NIVAHF algorithm.
This innovation will be pivotal in the early detection of graft anomalies, potentially amplifying
survival rates and uplifting health trajectories for OHT beneficiaries. Lastly, as LVADs,
especially the HeartMate 3, become indispensable in heart failure management, our focus
sharpens on crafting an AI-driven neural network algorithm tailored for HM3 LVAD patients. The
culmination of these targeted efforts will be to furnish a dependable, non-invasive PCWP
monitoring device with NIVAHF to these vulnerable heart failure patients."

BACE1 is an enzyme required for Aβ generation, and chemical inhibition of BACE1 has been
explored for reducing Aβ generation. Five brain-penetrable BACE1 inhibitory dugs were recently
tested in human trials. Unfortunately, despite a noted reduction in Aβ plaque loads, these clinical
trials were terminated, largely due to neuronal and synaptic toxicity. This setback indicates the
importance to known more BACE1 biology and to develop safer BACE1 inhibitors for AD
treatment, especially considering the growing evidence from anti- Aβ trials that reducing Aβ
plaques early can lead to reduction of other AD pathologies. In this proposal, we aim to test a
novel hypothesis that increasing inhibition of BACE1 in glial cells, along with boosting microglial
phagocytic functions, will reduce AD pathologies while minimizing synaptic side effects. This
hypothesis is supported by our recent observations that Bace1 deletion in microglia facilitates the
transition of homeostatic microglia to more phagocytic stage-1 disease-associated microglia
(DAM-1). Consistently, deletion of microglial Bace1 in 5xFAD mice reduces amyloid deposition.
If Bace1 in astrocytes is deleted, the expression of genes, such as clusterin (Clu), CXCL14 and
ApoE, important for removal of amyloid plaques by astrocytes, is increased. These results
suggest that BACE1 inhibition in glial cells has a beneficial effect on the clearance of amyloid
plaques. However, many questions remain to be answered. For example, it is not clear whether
Bace1 deletion will affect tau pathology. We do not yet know how BACE1 inhibition will enhance
microglia to remove tau pathology. Considering the known role of chemoattractant molecule
CXCL14 in mediating migration of immune cells and reduced levels of CXCL14 in AD brains, we
will ask whether the expected elevated levels of CXCL14, in response to the inhibition by BACE1,
will promote phagocytic function of microglia. This question will be address by utilizing an
inducible transgenic mouse model that has already been generated. In this proposal, we will
explore whether deletion of BACE1 in PS19 mouse microglia will reduce tau pathology in Aim 1.
In Aim 2, we will ask whether a low dose inhibition of BACE1 in AD triple-transgenic model
coupled with deletion of Bace1 in microglia will reduce both amyloid and tau pathologies
effectively. In Aim 3, we will investigate whether enhancing expression of CXCL14 will promote
microglia migration and phagocytosis. These studies are centered on improving microglia function
and the knowledge gained from this study will help to develop a therapeutic approach that will
favor BACE1 inhibition in glial cells coupled with molecular boosters of microglia phagocytic
function for AD treatment."

 In the United States, Ixodes scapularis ticks harbor and transmit several pathogens including
human anaplasmosis bacterial agent Anaplasma phagocytophilum. This bacterium is transmitted to the
vertebrate host by an infected tick bite. Several studies have addressed molecular mechanisms that A.
phagocytophilum uses to survive in the mammalian host. Relatively, few studies have clearly defined the
molecular strategies that this bacterium uses to survive in ticks. In the previous funding period, we
performed a comprehensive molecular analysis on I. scapularis organic anion transporting polypeptides
4056 (IsOATP4056) and genes involved in the tryptophan metabolism pathway in A. phagocytophilum-tick
interactions. We made substantial progress and have published several research articles showing
importance of IsOATP4056 and the tryptophan pathway in the survival and transmission of A.
phagocytophilum from ticks to the naïve vertebrate host. Passive Immunization with IsOATP4056
antibodies impaired A. phagocytophilum transmission from ticks to the vertebrate host. Anaplasma
phagocytophilum upregulates IsOATP4056 and activates the tryptophan pathway leading to the
increased synthesis of endogenous levels of tryptophan metabolite, Xanthurenic acid (XA). The
increased XA prevents the build-up of reactive oxygen species facilitating bacterial survival in tick cells. In
addition, A. phagocytophilum activates the XA-mediated p38-MAPK pathway to inhibit tick cell death
thereby facilitating the survival of both the bacterial agent and its vector host. We also reported a novel
role for XA in the transcriptional activation of isoatp4056 gene expression. Furthermore, A.
phagocytophilum downregulates microRNA (miR133) that targets isoatp4056 for its survival and
transmission from vector to the vertebrate host. These findings from our previous funding period
provide a strong rationale for the proposed aims for this R01 (competing renewal) application. In
Aim 1, we propose to understand the mechanism of how passive immunization affects the transmission of
A. phagocytophilum from ticks to the vertebrate host. In Aim 2, we will analyze whether targeting
IsOATP4056 via active immunization or OATP inhibitor treatment affects the transmission of A.
phagocytophilum from ticks to the vertebrate host. In Aim 3, we will characterize XA-mediated regulation
of miRNAs that are important in regulating gene expression during A. phagocytophilum survival and
transmission from infected ticks to the naïve host. Based on the success in the previous funding period
and the aims proposed in this renewal application, we believe that this could be a transformative study that
not only serves as a model to study intimate relationships established by pathogens with their arthropod
vectors but may also lead in the development of new strategies to interrupt the transmission of this and
perhaps other rickettsial bacteria of medical importance."

18% caused by excess body weight, physical inactivity, excess alcohol consumption, and poor nutrition.
Intensive Longitudinal Data (ILD) methods, which collect many assessments captured at high density on a micro-
timescale (e.g., seconds, minutes, hours) using real-time data capture methodologies (e.g., Ecological
Momentary Assessment [EMA] and accelerometry), offer enormous opportunities for insight into the dynamic
nature of cancer control behaviors and outcomes. In ILD studies, it is common to have hundreds to thousands
of observations per subject, and this allows us to model intraindividual parameters comprised of time-varying
variables such as means (e.g., how unhappy is a subject, on average, across occasions?), variances (e.g., how
erratic is a subject’s mood across occasions?), and slopes (e.g., is a subject’s mood related to feelings of energy
across occasions?). In our prior work, we developed a software, called MixWILD, consisting of a series of two-
stage multilevel statistical models testing the effects of intraindividual means, variances, and slopes on time-
varying and subject-level outcomes. The next generation of ILD studies has begun to use multi-burst (e.g.,
multiple day EMA periods interspersed with days with no assessment) and continuous (e.g., 24-hour/days per
week smartwatch accelerometry) measurement designs, allowing the entire study to extend across months or
years. However, available data analysis techniques cannot address common substantive questions that arise
with multi-burst and continuous ILD designs such as does momentary mood variability increase across a year?
Also, do month-to-month increases in momentary mood variability predict declines in sleep duration over a year?
To address these gaps, we will develop multilevel models capable of (Aim 1) jointly estimating how within-burst
means, variability, and slopes differ between bursts and/or subjects, (Aim 2) testing predictors (either occasion,
burst-, person-level) of how within-burst means, variability, and slopes differ between bursts and/or subjects, and
(Aim 3) testing whether random effects from Aim 1 predict subject- and burst-level cancer control outcomes. We
will test and apply these statistical features by conducting secondary analyses of data from a multi-burst ILD
study of cancer control behaviors and outcome, which conducted mobile sensing, EMA, and accelerometry from
246 emerging adults (ages 18-29) across 12 months. We will also develop, test, and disseminate a stand-alone
software with GUI capable of running these statistical models to be used by applied behavioral and social science
researchers. The methods to be developed can easily generalize to a variety of other disease areas such asthma,
disordered eating, suicide prevention, HIV risk, medication adherence, and environmental exposures."

Mitochondrial Lon is an ATP-powered protease that plays a pivotal role in regulating mitochondrial proteostasis,
metabolism and cell stress responses. Biallelic mutations in the LONP1 gene cause a broad spectrum of rare
developmental diseases presenting during early development, which include CODAS syndrome- characterized
by cerebral, ocular, dental, auricular and skeletal anomalies, profound neurological dysfunction and depletion of
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). This project aims at filling a fundamental knowledge gap pertaining to the
mechanistic impact of Lon binding to mtDNA and its role in regulating mtDNA integrity and expression. We will
employ isogenic patient-derived induced pluripotent cell (iPSCs) with homozygous mutations in the LONP1 gene
causing CODAS syndrome c.2161C>G, (p.Arg721Gly), or severe neurologic dysfunction c.2282 C>T,
(p.Pro761Leu). Using iPSC-derived cell types expressing Lon-WT, Lon-R721G and Lon-P761L we will: (1)
characterize differences in mitochondrial protein turnover, energetics and cell stress responses; (2) determine
mtDNA-binding by wild-type and mutant Lon proteins using chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing
(ChIP-seq); and (3) analyze the biogenesis of mtRNA transcripts using single-molecule fluorescence in situ
hybridization (smFISH). The innovative approach of smFISH will allow us to determine differences in mtRNA
synthesis, half-lives (i.e., degradation rates) and spatial localization within mitochondria. This project will provide
new mechanistic insights into the importance of Lon in regulating mtDNA maintenance, transcription and
translation, which has broader implications for its critical roles during normal physiology and common diseases
such as cancer, neurodegeneration and cardiac dysfunction."

Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death and disease in the United States. The majority of
smokers report the desire to quit smoking; however only 3-5% of unaided quit attempts are successful;
highlighting the need for TUD treatments. Currently, there are only three classes of FDA-approved
pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation. While these medications have shown effectiveness in increasing
abstinence during randomized clinical trials, the benefit of using such treatments decreases over the course of
a year, and long-term quit rates rarely exceed 30%. Thus, innovations in treatment approaches are needed to
reach further reductions in tobacco use. Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabivarin (Δ9-THCV) is a phytocannabinoid, which is
thought to be a CB1 receptor antagonist and partial CB2 receptor agonist. Δ9-THCV has shown initial promise
as a novel therapeutic for nicotine dependence and addictive disorders. Evidence from several animal models
indicates that THCV reduces nicotine self-administration, reduces cue- and nicotine-induced relapse-like
behavior, and improves nicotine withdrawal symptoms. The proposed study consists of a randomized, double-
blind, counter-balanced, crossover human laboratory study of Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabivarin (Δ9-THCV) for daily
smokers. A total of 32 daily smokers will complete two outpatient study visits after 5 days underΔ9-THCV and
matched placebo, during which they will undergo a Smoking Lapse task to assess: (a) the ability to resist
smoking, (b) cigarette smoking self-administration, (c) subjective craving, (d) withdrawal, and (e) subjective
effects of nicotine. This study will test the initial efficacy of Δ9-THCV, which is essential for understanding the
clinical potential of this naturally occurring cannabinoid as a treatment for smoking cessation. Given the wide
prevalence cigarette use and the high acceptability of naturally-occurring products, such as cannabinoids, as
therapeutic agents, the proposed study has the potential to be transformative in uncovering the therapeutic
benefits of Δ9-THCV."

 We will establish a satellite service center within a larger network according to RFAs RM-19-009 and -010,
named the CU-Boulder Center for Cryo-Electron Tomography (CCET). Our satellite will focus on cryo-
specimen preparation and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) applied to cells, organelles and large
supramolecular assemblies. The applicants combine the expertise of three P.I.s, Michael Stowell (high-
resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM)), Karolin Luger (biochemistry of large complex assemblies,
especially protein-nucleic acid interactions), and Andreas Hoenger (former P41 director, cryo-EM and cryo-ET
from macromolecules to cells and tissues). With our current staff, we combine extensive expertise with cryo-ET
and relevant software. We will offer a broad range of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-ET
preparation procedures for cellular structures and intracellular macromolecular assemblies, as well as training
opportunities for scientists who would like to establish these technologies, or at least part of them, for their home
labs. Here in Boulder, we have several high-end microscopes available, including a newly installed Titan-Krios.
Three of our microscopes are equipped with direct electron detectors. In addition, we have a comprehensive
periphery for cryo-specimen preparation, storage, and handling resources, including computational tools. We
will add cryo-Focused Ion Beam (cryo-FIB) milling to produce vitrified lamellae of cells and tissues. We propose
the following organization of the facility: Specific Aim 1: Cryo-ET specimen preparation methods offered
for service: Our technology and expertise will be made accessible for our users and for further collaborations
with the data collection hub proposed in a parallel RFA (RM-19-010). Specific Aim 2: Cross-training
opportunities for service users: We will offer comprehensive training for users, including one-on-one
instruction on microscopes and related equipment. As appropriate, we will pool users into small groups and run
a training week as a hands-on workshop on equipment as well as related software developed by our facility such
as Serial-EM, IMOD and PEET. While the emphasis with training will be on practical aspects of specimen
preparation and data collection, we often encounter novice users in strong need for a thorough introduction into
image analysis software as well. Specific Aim 3: Administration and organization of the facility: Users,
assigned to us via the network-wide application process will have the opportunity to participate in the specimen
refinement process, and receive training on the cryo-ET processes involved. Projects with high potential will be
referred for high-throughput data collection to the central hub facility of the network. Boulder, Colorado is centrally
located and well-connected nationwide through Denver International Airport."

RAS GTPase operates as a molecular switch toggling between GDP-bound (inactive) and GTP-bound forms
(active), and orchestrates dynamic cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, survival, and T-cell
development.1,2 Despite its binary nature, RAS exhibits sophisticated and dynamic signaling behavior influenced
by cellular context and subcellular localization. The lack of a precise understanding of the roles of spatiotemporal
compartmentalization in RAS hinders our understanding of fundamental signaling mechanisms and limits our
ability to develop targeted therapies for RAS-driven cancers. To address this, we will leverage a chemical genetic
tool called Chemically-Inducible Activator of RAS (CIAR) that allows the rapid and dose-dependent activation of
wild-type RAS with bio-orthogonal small molecules.8-10 Aim 1 describes efforts to use transmembrane-tethered
versions of NS3a-CIAR to dissect the impact of differential membrane localization on wild-type RAS activation
and downstream signaling. This Aim also describes the development of chemical tools for quantitatively
measuring the transmembrane localization of proteins and using a novel tool for probing RAS-GTP in its native
cellular context. Aim 2 aims to investigate the role of oligomerization of signaling proteins at membranes. An
engineered protein toolkit will be used to control the oligomeric state and study its impact on Ras-mediated
signaling. Finally, Aim 3 explores efforts to dissect how the intracellular signaling environment affects the kinetics
of magnitude of RAS activation and downstream signaling. This Aim also explores the development of a number
of chemical genetic tools for enabling intracellular protein display at membranes. Overall, the studies described
herein will offer new and important mechanistic insight into RAS signaling."

Multiple Myeloma (MM) is almost always preceded by monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance
(MGUS) and smoldering myeloma (SMM), with a transformation rate of ~1% and ~10% per year, respectively.
Large racial disparities exist in MM and its premalignant conditions; compared to Whites, African-Americans
have a two-fold increased prevalence of MGUS/MM and are diagnosed with MM at younger ages. What is
lacking is the identification of the true transition steps that occur from early precancerous stages to overt MM
and identifying the biological precancer stages of the disease. Here, we propose to construct the Myeloma
Multidimensional Pre-Cancer Atlas (MMPCA). We believe that the identification of the transition stages
along the spectrum of healthy, precursor MM to overt MM in a racially diverse population represents a missed
opportunity to fully inform disease characterization, monitoring, and potential needs for patients to receive
early intervention therapies. We will leverage our large collection of samples from two cohort studies that are
racially diverse with over 30% African or African Americans and with over 10,000 samples collected serially
over the last 10 years; and with well-annotated data of disease progression. Our overarching hypothesis is
that malignant transformation occurs through the cooperative acquisition of genomic and microenvironment
alterations that occur in a susceptible host environment. The MMPCA will create a comprehensive spatial
and temporal atlas of precursor MM to understand genomic and microenvironmental alterations across the
spectrum of disease evolution from healthy to MM. In specific Aim 1, we will map the spatial interactions
among early B cell clonal expansions with the microenvironment using Xenium spatial transcriptomic and
imaging mass cytometry (IMC). In specific Aim 2, we will chart the subclonal genomic structure at the single
cell level across the spectrum of disease from healthy to MM, and in specific Aim 3, we will characterize at
the single cell level the microenvironment (immune and non-immune stromal cells) and its association with
progression across the spectrum of disease from healthy to MM. This provides a unique opportunity to study
events in a clinically well-defined precancer hematological condition that can be a great model of disease
progression and inform other precancer cell atlases. We also have access to serial blood and marrow
samples along the spectrum of the disease with long-term follow up of clinical progression for over 10 years.
Unlike in solid cancers, we can obtain biopsies from the tissue of origin without altering the natural course of
the precancerous lesions (no need for surgical resection) and therefore, we have a unique resource that can
be made available for other precancer atlases."
10982443,"Background: Our recent research demonstrated racial disparities in cesarean section delivery rates
among Veterans of color utilizing VA maternity care coordination (MCC) and delivering at community-
based hospitals. Disparate birth outcomes likely result from various factors that impact the Veteran at
multiple timepoints during the perinatal period; however, an in-depth examination of the social
determinants of health that may contribute to these disparities has yet to be conducted among
Veterans. This study will conduct an in-depth examination of the social and clinical factors leading to
cesarean deliveries among Veterans of color and test the feasibility of doula services to enhance VA
MCC in an effort to mitigate disparities in childbirth delivery outcomes among Veterans of color.
Significance: This novel study intensely examines the impact of the social determinants of health on
prenatal, labor & delivery, and postpartum care among Veterans of color in effort to mitigate
disparities in childbirth outcomes. This is the first study to test the feasibility of an enhanced MCC
model that incorporates doula services to improve pregnancy outcomes. The proposed study is
directly responsive to several HSR&D priorities including health equity, women Veterans’ health,
access to care, and care coordination.
Innovation and Impact: This is the first VA study to examine social determinants of health among
Veterans of color who have delivered babies using the VA Maternity Care benefit. It is also the first
study to examine the feasibility of a doula program that complements VA MCC support for Veterans of
color, who are at an increased risk for cesarean delivery.
Specific Aim 1: Conduct an in-depth investigation with Veterans of color to better understand their
recent cesarean deliveries, using semi-structured interviews and systematic obstetrical chart reviews.
Specific Aim 2: Test the feasibility of an enhanced VA Maternity Care Coordination program which
incorporates doula care to ensure Veterans of color are receiving continuous support throughout
pregnancy, labor and delivery, and the postpartum period.
Specific Aim 3: Share our study findings (Aims 1 & 2) with VA stakeholders, including Women’s
Health Services leadership, through expert roundtable sessions. Utilize the qualitative data from these
proceedings to further inform a larger intervention that will seek to reduce childbirth delivery disparities
among Veterans of color.
Methodology: This is a mixed methods study that will utilize existing survey data and obstetrical chart
audits to augment qualitative interviews in an effort to better understand the impact of social
determinants of health and the role continuous perinatal support has on Veterans.
Next Steps/Implementation: We plan to disseminate findings among our key stakeholders through
expert roundtable discussions. The findings from these sessions will promote and inform a larger VA
intervention that will seek to further mitigate childbirth delivery disparities among Veterans. Our
findings may result in (1) an improved understanding of the impact of the social determinants on the
prenatal and childbirth labor and delivery outcomes among Veterans of color; (2) an understanding of
the feasibility of collaborative teams comprised of VA Maternity Care Coordinators and doulas in
providing continuous prenatal, labor and delivery, and postpartum support to Veterans; (3) a
stakeholder informed intervention developed to address the social determinants of health in effort to
improve the quality of care for racial and ethnic minority pregnant Veterans."
10996769,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The precise pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains unknown, but the development of amyloid-
beta (Aβ) plaques is thought to be a key initiating event preceding the formation of neurofibrillary tangles and
clinical disease. Anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies (mAb) are the first disease modifying therapies approved for AD,
but clinical trials showed significant and potentially fatal dose-limiting side effects, including amyloid-related
imaging abnormalities (ARIA) that can manifest as edema and microhemorrhage. Peripheral
monocytes/macrophages enter the brain and associate with Aβ plaques in the APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model
of AD. These cells can reduce plaque load in vivo despite making up a small percentage of plaque-associated
macrophages, suggesting that a better mechanistic understanding of the recruitment and function of these cells
in the AD brain may improve anti-Aβ therapies. In preliminary work, a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) was
expressed in macrophages (CAR-Ms) containing an extracellular Aβ binding domain and an intracellular Fc
receptor signaling domain to enhance the ability of these cells to phagocytose Aβ. Aβ CAR-Ms reduced plaque
load ex vivo on amyloid-laden APP/PS1 brain slices, and in vivo when injected into the hippocampus of APP/PS1
mice; however, plaque reduction was confined to the region immediately surrounding the cell injection site and
CAR-M migration was minimal, limiting its efficacy. The objective of this proposal is to enhance the efficacy of
Aβ CAR-Ms by identifying factors that promote the infiltration of peripheral monocytes into the brain and their
migration within the brain parenchyma. This proposal will test the hypothesis that improving brain infiltration and
migration of Aβ CAR-Ms will improve Aβ clearance in aged APP/PS1 mice without increasing ARIA. An important
theoretical advantage of CAR-M therapy compared to mAb therapy is the active degradation of plaque material,
potentially mitigating concerns for ARIA. Aim 1 will determine whether CX3CR1 overexpression allows CAR-Ms
to better infiltrate the brain from the periphery and characterize brain-penetrating CAR-Ms. This aim will further
investigate the effect of Aβ CAR-Ms on the composition and phenotype of the brain cellular microenvironment.
Aim 2 will compare the safety and efficacy of CAR-M therapy to mAb therapy in APP/PS1 mice. While mouse
models do not replicate the entire spectrum of human ARIA, the frequency of microhemorrhages after CAR-M
or mAb treatment will be quantified as a measure of ARIA-like phenomena. These studies will further develop
and characterize a novel form of AD therapy and provide insights in basic macrophage biology. I will pursue
these studies under the guidance of a team of physician-scientists, including a sponsor with expertise in CAR
and macrophage biology, and a co-sponsor with over two decades of experience in AD mouse modeling. My
training plan incorporates inter-departmental expertise and core facilities in the setting of Washington University’s
prestigious MD and Immunology PhD programs, and I am confident that completion of this fellowship will provide
me with the skills and career competencies necessary to develop into an independent physician-scientist."

Understanding heterogeneity in vaccine-induced immune responses and its impact on efficacy outcomes is
important for developing effective vaccines. Diverse host and environmental factors, such as the gut
microbiome, can impact vaccine responses. Important roles of gut microbiota in the development and function
of the local gut and gut-distal immune system are only beginning to be appreciated. Importantly, how gut
microbiota composition may shape vaccine-induced immune responses is not fully understood. Interestingly,
malaria vaccines are initially tested in US or European individuals, who have distinctly different gut microbiota
communities than individuals living throughout Africa. The effect of differential gut microbiota between US and
African individuals on immune responses to malaria vaccines may greatly impact vaccine efficacy in the target
population. The objective of this proposal is to evaluate how differential gut microbiota populations may
influence malaria vaccine-induced immune responses using a controlled, genetically tractable microbiome-
repopulated mouse model. Observations in animal models demonstrate that gut microbiota can function as
adjuvants via activation of pattern recognition receptor signaling pathways for non-adjuvanted vaccines.
Limited human observation and intervention studies (i.e., antibiotic treatment) also support the idea that gut
microbiota affect vaccine-induced immune responses. These studies highlight an urgent need to understand
better the effect of differential gut microbiota on vaccine-induced immunity. Many malaria vaccines rely on the
induction of antibody responses via germinal center (GC) reactions, including the two recently approved by
WHO (RTS,S and R21) and pre-clinical malaria vaccine candidates under investigation in the laboratory of Dr.
Srinivasan. These studies underscore the importance of robust antibody titer in mediating parasite
neutralization of sporozoites (infecting hepatocytes) and merozoites (infecting erythrocytes). Dr. Schmidt's
laboratory has shown in mice that differences in gut microbiota determine the magnitude and quality of GC
reactions and efficient control of parasites following Plasmodium yoelii (Py) infection. These observations
support the central hypothesis that gut microbiota composition, through its effects on GC reaction, will impact
the quantity and quality of malaria vaccine-induced immune responses, thereby influencing vaccine efficacy.
We will test this hypothesis through the following aims: Specific Aim 1. How do differential murine gut
microbiota populations impact malaria vaccine-induced antibody responses? Specific Aim 2. How do African
and US human gut microbiota communities shape malaria vaccine-induced antibody responses?"

The purpose of this Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award is to provide support for Ms.
Sanna Darvish, a PhD student in Dr. Douglas Seals’ laboratory at the University of Colorado Boulder, to
conduct research that will prepare her to become an independent investigator in the field of cerebrovascular
aging. As part of her proposed training plan, she will learn a variety of new technical, conceptual, intellectual,
and professional skills and refine research skills currently under development. To do so, she will add
outcomes to an ongoing NIH R01-funded clinical trial led by her Sponsor to investigate the efficacy of the
mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant, MitoQ, for improving cerebrovascular function in older adults and the
mechanism(s) of action. She will also assess the effects of MitoQ on fluid cognitive function. Cardiovascular
diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of mortality in the U.S. Cerebrovascular diseases represent 37% of all
CVD and, when considered alone, are the 5th most common cause of death. Aging is the primary risk factor for
CVD, cerebrovascular diseases, Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. Decreased cerebrovascular
function (i.e., reduced cerebrovascular reactivity [CVR] and cerebral blood flow) is a key mechanism
contributing to the age-related increase in risk for these diseases and is mediated in part by decreases in the
vasodilatory molecule nitric oxide (NO), leading to cerebral endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction. Excessive
reactive oxygen species production by mitochondria (mtROS) is an important contributor to
cerebrovascular dysfunction as mtROS can scavenge NO and impair EC function. As such, establishing novel
strategies to decrease mtROS to improve cerebrovascular function in older adults is an important biomedical
research priority. Supported by a strong scientific premise and compelling preliminary results, Ms. Darvish
will use innovative translational approaches to determine if three months of MitoQ treatment (versus placebo;
n=30/group) in older adults (60 years of age) Aim 1) improves cerebrovascular function; Aim 2) if the
improvements are mediated by a) reductions in tonic suppression of cerebrovascular function by mtROS, and
b) beneficial changes in the circulating milieu that improve cerebral EC function; and Aim 3) if MitoQ improves
fluid cognition and if improvements are associated with enhanced cerebrovascular function. The proposed
research will be the first to assess the efficacy of MitoQ treatment for improving cerebrovascular function in
older adults, a group at elevated risk for cerebrovascular diseases, Alzheimer’s disease and related
dementias. This F31 fellowship project addresses important NIA research priorities to: 1) identify effective
interventions aimed at preventing age-related diseases, and 2) investigate biological mechanism(s)
involved in aging using translational, systems-based approaches. Under the supervision of her mentors, Ms.
Darvish will complete the proposed research and training plan to advance an independent line of
investigation and facilitate development towards becoming a successful independent scientific investigator."

Mitochondria, essential cellular organelles, are increasingly recognized for their central role in human health.
Beyond their canonical function in energy production, mitochondria are implicated in diverse cellular processes,
influencing metabolism, apoptosis, and signaling pathways. Dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics has been
implicated in a spectrum ranging from neurodegenerative disorders and metabolic syndromes to muscle-related
disorders and aging, highlighting the multifaceted impact of mitochondria on human health. Recent studies have
established the crucial roles of the evolutionarily conserved aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme ALH-6/ALDH4A1
and the cytoprotective transcription factor SKN-1/NRF2 in mediating responses to mitochondrial stress.
Significantly, C. elegans mutants encoding single amino acid mutations in the alh-6 gene developed
mitochondria- and muscle-related dysfunction earlier than the normal counterparts, and the SKN-1/NRF2 stress
response is activated to curtail cellular dysfunction. Our investigation builds upon established knowledge of alh-
6 mutations in Caenorhabditis elegans, which induce premature aging, impaired muscle function, and
mitochondrial abnormalities. The project's intellectual significance lies in unraveling the cell autonomous
and non-autonomous functions of mitochondrial health, specifically mitochondrial amino acid
metabolism, and deciphering its impact on muscle-mitochondrial dynamics. My preliminary findings
suggest the potential to decouple lifespan effects from other healthspan metrics in single tissues, offering a
unique view of the impact of tissue-specific alh-6 rescues and its implications for overall organismal well-being.
The proposed research investigates the role of mitochondrial proline catabolism, specifically the aldehyde
dehydrogenase gene alh-6, in the context of muscle-mitochondrial health and its implications for overall
organismal longevity. Thus, through meticulously designed aims, my first aim will employ innovative techniques,
including CRISPR/Cas9-genetically edited tissue-specific rescues, single-cell RNA sequencing with 10x
Genomics, and mitochondrial assessments, to comprehensively characterize alh-6 activity. This investigation
delves into the molecular landscape of tissue-specific alh-6 rescues, offering insights into cellular heterogeneity
and contributing to our understanding of how aberrations in mitochondrial proline catabolism impact muscle cells.
My second aim will unravel the intricate inter-tissue coordination vital for maintaining mitochondrial health via
mutagenesis screens, genetic mapping, and physiological analyses, seeking to identify and understand the
specific molecular pathways transmitting signals to the body wall muscle. Together, my research aligns with
human health relevance, as mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of muscle-related diseases, including
Sarcopenia and muscular dystrophy. By linking mitochondrial structure and function, the study holds promise for
deciphering the intricate dynamics between muscle and mitochondria, with implications for human health and
the development of targeted interventions for diseases characterized by mitochondrial impairment."
10998236,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pulmonary endothelial cells (ECs) are in direct contact with laminar blood flow, resulting in exposure to shear
stress. Normal blood flow provides a physiologic degree of shear stress at which ECs achieve quiescence.
Pathologic changes in shear stress can occur in several conditions ranging from pulmonary embolism, where
shear stress acutely decreases due to vessel occlusion, to pulmonary hypertension (PH), where shear stress in
the distal arteries increases due to luminal narrowing. These disease entities carry considerable morbidity and
mortality despite available therapeutics. The biochemical derangements that occur when shear stress is altered
are not well-characterized, and elucidating these pathways may provide novel insight into potential therapeutic
targets to prevent long-term dysfunction of ECs. In vitro culture of ECs is often performed under static conditions,
leading to underappreciation of the effects of physiologic shear stress on normal cellular function as well as the
biochemical and functional impact of shear perturbations. Aquaporin 1 (AQP1), a ubiquitous protein that forms
water channels, is known to be expressed in vivo in the pulmonary endothelium, but we noted that AQP1
expression is not observed in human lung microvascular endothelial cells (hLMVECs) grown in static cell culture.
My preliminary data show restored AQP1 expression in cultured hLMVECs with exposure to physiologic shear
stress, suggesting a critical role of shear stress in dynamically regulating AQP1 expression. Increased AQP1 has
recently been linked to important cellular functions, including angiogenesis and proliferation in certain
malignancies, as well as contributing to vascular remodeling through apoptosis resistance and hyperproliferation
in the ECs from rat models of PH. Regulation of AQP1 is not well-described in hLMVECs but is calcium-
dependent in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells. Aim 1 of this proposal is designed to elucidate the
biochemical signaling that occurs in response to changes in shear stress. In preliminary data, I show intracellular
calcium levels increase in response to increased shear stress. I seek to define this signaling pathway focusing
on the role of activation of the membrane ion channel, TRPV4, which can increase calcium influx in ECs in
response to mechanical stimuli, in regulating AQP1 levels. Aim 2 will explore the functional outcome of changes
in AQP1 expression in response to varying degrees of shear stress, focusing on apoptosis and proliferation.
Techniques utilized will include but are not limited to cell culture under shear stress, ratiometric calcium
measurement, protein and mRNA measurement, immunofluorescence microscopy, and measures of apoptosis
and proliferation. Completion of this project will provide novel insight into the impact of shear stress on EC
function, and how derangements in shear stress may alter cell signaling and cell growth and survival. The skills
acquired in the design and execution of this study and the experimental results obtained will provide the
necessary foundation for a K award and an excellent platform on which to start a career as an independently
funded clinician-scientist focused on diseases of endothelial dysfunction."

Glioblastoma (GBM) is an incurable primary malignant brain cancer characterized by a high degree of
interpatient and intratumoral genomic and cellular heterogeneity, a brief median survival (14 months), and
absence of an effective treatment. One of the key aspects of GBM rapid growth and underlying resistance to
therapeutic interventions is its highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Recent studies have
also demonstrated an underappreciated effect of GBM on the immune system as a whole, in particular on the
immune cells of the bone marrow. Here, we propose to perform exploratory studies on the role of two major
myeloid receptors, Trem1 and Trem2, in fine tuning the hematological responses of the bone marrow to the
presence of GBM using a novel mouse model of GBM. We created a novel C57Bl6/J syngeneic model of
EGFR-driven GBM that allows orthotopic allogenic engraftment in the CNS. We will use this model to study the
function of Trem1 and Trem2 in the emergency myelopoiesis response to GBM. Using conditional Cre/Lox
alleles of Trem1 and Trem2 C57Bl6/J strains and cell specific Cre transgenic mice, we will selectively
eliminate Trem1 and Trem2 in various myeloid compartments in the presence of GBM, and determine their
functions by analyzing the resulting GBM immune microenvironment composition and function by flow
cytometry. We, and others have demonstrated that Trem1 is mostly expressed on granulocytes whereas
Trem2 is mainly expressed on monocytes, macrophages and microglia. By eliminating the expression of
Trem1 and Trem2 in their respective cell types, we will directly determine their potential as future targets for
pharmacological intervention in the treatment of GBM. This research will not only advance our knowledge of
immune-based intervention for GBM clinical management but also will establish and solidify a new, genetically
accurate and relevant mouse model of GBM."

Early life adversity (ELA), such as neglect or maltreatment in childhood, is a major risk factor for the development
of psychiatric disorders later in life. ELA heightens responses to threats, usually at the expense of rewarding
behaviors. Excessive threat avoidance is a hallmark of anxiety, phobias, and depression. Circuits that process
both rewards and threats, including the basolateral amygdala (BLA), are known to be dysregulated by ELA and
have been implicated in the pathophysiology of these conditions. These circuits mature throughout early life and
into early adulthood. This extended window of development, when paired with enhanced exploration in
adolescence, facilitates refinement of neural circuits underlying nuanced behavioral strategies needed
throughout life. Salient experiences, such as ELA, are encoded in groups of coactive neuronal ensembles
throughout the brain and have the capability to impact circuit organization. Although symptoms of psychiatric
disorders often manifest in adolescence, most studies focus on adult outcomes of ELA. As a result, the biological
mechanisms connecting ELA to enhanced threat avoidance later in life remain largely unknown. This proposal
aims to bridge this gap by determining how ELA-sensitive cells within the BLA drive brain-wide circuit
reorganization underlying enhanced avoidance behavior in adolescent mice. My central hypothesis will be tested
in two aims. Experiments in Aim 1 will reveal the endogenous activity of ELA-sensitive ensembles in the BLA
during threat avoidance behavior and map their brain-wide connectivity. Experiments in Aim 2 will identify
sensitive windows during development when ELA-sensitive neurons alter developmental circuit trajectories,
leading to increased avoidance. I will gain extensive training in the neurobiology of ELA and application of
systems neuroscience approaches including activity-dependent genetic labeling, chemogenetics and whole
brain circuit mapping to the developing brain. This research will illuminate how early experiences can alter the
trajectory of postnatal brain development and identify sensitive windows and targets for circuit-level therapeutics
that can be used to prevent or treat mental health disorders in at-risk populations."
10997616,"There is increasing recognition that the most common “chronic condition” in older adults is multiple chronic conditions (MCCs). Yet, due to the dominance of a disease-specific approach to clinical care and research, there is a lack of evidence and an urgent need for more research to guide clinical practice and inform shared clinical decision-making in older adults with MCCs. We propose a new American Geriatrics Society (AGS) “Advancing the Science of Multiple Chronic Conditions (MCCs) in Older Adults” R13 conference series that leverages the NIA-funded Health Care Systems Research Network (HCSRN)-Older Americans Independence Centers (OAICs) AGING (Advancing Geriatrics Infrastructure and Network Growth) Initiative (R33AG057806-06A1) expertise, and furthers the long-running and successful AGS NIA U13/R13 “Bench-to-Bedside” (B2B) conference series (offered since 2004 with themes including frailty, inflammation/nutrition, geriatric syndromes, common co-morbid pairings, and resilience). The proposed R13 is a logical extension of the ongoing AGS/AGING LEARNING Collaborative, through which we have developed an innovative curriculum to educate the next generation of MCCs researchers (R25AG071488). The mission of this conference grant is to deepen research efforts relating to the science of MCCs in older adults, with the potential to greatly improve the health and healthcare of the growing population of older people living with MCCs, including those with AD/ADRD. As the pool of researchers focused on MCCs in older adults has increased, a conference series focused on cutting-edge research directly relevant to MCCs in older adults, that will facilitate and enhance collaborative, interdisciplinary research endeavors is critical. The proposed conference series will focus on areas such as explanatory and pragmatic clinical trials related to MCCs prevention and management, mechanistic research, and clinical practice improvement across clinical settings. The first conference in the series will focus specifically on the intersection of MCCs and AD/ADRD. Under this R13, we will especially seek to promote health equity, integrating the voices of patients and care partners into our scientific conference planning activities, and special efforts will be made to make participation available to underrepresented minoritized (URM) scientists. We propose three scientific conferences over the course of the R13. The theme of each conference will vary. The theme of our first conference will be “The Intersection of MCCs and AD/ADRD.” The theme of our second conference will be “Sex/Gender and MCCs Research.” The theme of our third conference will be “Preventing MCCs Along the Life Course.” The educational goals of each conference will focus around: (1) content knowledge; (2) addressing methodologic research challenges; (3) career development (e.g., manuscript development and publication; funding strategies and grantsmanship); and (4) networking. Each conference will provide a unique and unparalleled opportunity to advance cutting-edge research relating to MCCs in older adults, including those with AD/ADRD, and to advance the careers of junior investigators."
11000020,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Generation of high affinity antibodies in germinal centers (GCs) is a fundamental immunological process that
provides protection against infection. Antibody affinity maturation follows a prototypical Darwinian evolutionary
framework, in which rare GC B cells that acquire affinity-increasing mutations in the antigen-binding portions of
their immunoglobulin genes selectively undergo massive proliferation, leading to their expansion within the GC
population at the expense of lower-affinity clones. Through iterative rounds of selection and expansion, GC B
cells increase their affinity toward a particular pathogen or antigen, while being exported as memory or plasma
cells and contributing to the affinity of serum antibody over time.
GC B cells are among the fastest dividing mammalian cells and are uniquely equipped with a distinct cell cycle
program that allows them to divide every 4-6 hours. At its extreme, this robust expansion program can lead to
clonal bursts, in which a single B cell can take over a 2,000-cell GC in just a few days. Interestingly, GC B cells
can enter S phase in the apparent absence of mitogen, as if by “inertia,” hence their rapid mode of cell division
is termed “inertial cycling”. Notably, many of the key drivers of GC-derived B cell lymphoma, such as cyclin D3,
are critical for triggering and sustaining strong cell cycles in GC B cells. Despite its importance in the expansion
of high-affinity B cell clones and development of GC-derived lymphomas, the precise cellular dynamics and
molecular pathways that underlie inertial cycling of GC B cells remain poorly understood. This gap in our
understanding is primarily due to a lack of tools with the necessary spatial and temporal sensitivity to resolve GC
B cell cycles in vivo. The main goal of this research proposal is to define the cellular and molecular processes
that underly the unique cell cycle programs of GC B cells. To achieve this, we will characterize the spatiotemporal
dynamics of inertial cycling at a single cell level with intravital two-photon microscopy and fluorescent activity
sensors (Aim 1); and we will determine the principles that coordinate inertial cell cycling and mutability of B cell
receptors (Aim 2).
Completion of the proposed Aims will provide a comprehensive understanding of the specialized inertial mode
of GC B cell cycling and will contribute new insights into the fundamental mechanistic basis of how GCs select
for high affinity B cells. In addition, the findings from this proposed Aims will better our understanding of GC-
derived lymphomas, where inertial cycling becomes coopted for malignant transformation."

Malfunction of the brain’s waste clearing glymphatic system has been shown to play a key role in cerebral small
vessel disease the most common cause of vascular cognitive impairment prevalent with chronic hypertension in
the aging population. Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) affects 750 million people worldwide, causes up to
45% of all dementias, and accounts for ~20% of all stroke cases, yet the underlying pathophysiology - even in
the setting of hypertension - remains incompletely understood. Remarkably, the status of the lymphatic system
(LS) has not been investigated in cSVD. We have novel data showing functional impairment of the LS a cSVD
rat model with chronic hypertension (spontaneously hypertensive stroke prone (SHRSP) rat strain). Here we
posit the entirely novel idea that alterations of the lymphatic system including meningeal lymphatics and lymph
nodes draining brain waste in the setting of chronic hypertension contribute to cSVD. Specifically, we will test
the main hypotheses that, cSVD with chronic hypertension is associated with uncoupling of the glymphatic and
lymphatic systems and that systemic impairment of lymphatic drainage contributes to the pathogenesis of cSVD.
We will apply our novel imaging approaches and computational analysis tools to characterize lymphatic drainage
concurrently with glymphatic transport in a comprehensive series of experiments involving SHRSP rats with
normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats serving as controls. In Aim 1, we will determine the role of hypertension
on glymphatic-lymphatic coupling. Lymphatic system function will be measured concurrently with glymphatic
transport in untreated SHRSP rats and in SHRSP rats treated with antihypertensive medication (amlodipine) to
reduce small vessel pathology at the whole-body level. We hypothesize that decreased glymphatic transport in
SHRSP rats with chronic hypertension will be associated with glymphatic-lymphatic uncoupling. Furthermore,
we expect amlodipine treatment will restore LS function in SHRSP rats. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that the
pathogenesis of cSVD with chronic hypertension may be caused by a defect in lymphatic drainage that impairs
glymphatic waste clearance over time. This assumption will be tested by gain-of-function (increasing the
lymphatic vasculature with Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C (VEGF-C)) and loss-of-lymphatic drainage
(blocking drainage to the dcLN) experiments. In Aim 3 the goal is to generate a molecular and biochemical
platform which will drive the understanding of which changes in the lymphatic system are associated with chronic
hypertension. We will first conduct a comprehensive “omic” analysis of the CSF collected from WKY and SHRSP
rats in Aims 1 & 2, since our scientific premises indicate that CSF is a reliable mirror of the ongoing brain
activities. Next, we will move towards the anatomical, cellular and biochemical characterization of the lymphatics
draining to the deep cervical node, since preliminary studies indicate that collagen deposits are associated with
increased blood pressure. Molecular pathways that we identify can later be probed for therapeutic benefit."

 Limited data are available on the effects of prenatal opioid exposure on the brain and
neurodevelopment. The Outcomes of Babies with Opioid Exposure (OBOE) study, an ongoing NICHD-funded
longitudinal study enrolling infants with and without prenatal opioid exposure at birth and following them to 2
years of age, is collecting comprehensive exposure data including infant umbilical cords, advanced
neuroimaging data to evaluate brain development, and standardized and thorough information on the home
environment, maternal mental health, and parenting. The OBOE consortium has completed our goal enrollment
of 200 opioid-exposed infants and 100 unexposed infants with complete data at 0-1 months of age. In response
to RFA-HD-24-014, we now propose to complete follow-up to age 2, to fulfill our main study objectives. The
UAB site has contributed to the OBOE study by enrolling 52 opioid-exposed and 26 control infants, completing
92 MRIs so far, and contributing to the publication of multiple abstracts and three manuscripts using OBOE
data. The Specific Aims for this renewal grant are to:
Specific Aim 1: To determine the impact of prenatal opioid exposure on brain structure and
connectivity over the first two years of life. We have made progress toward this aim and have submitted
2 abstracts showing that prenatal opioid exposure is associated with increased white matter injury,
reductions in global, regional, and tissue-specific brain volumes, and altered functional connectivity.
Specific Aim 2: To define medical, developmental, and behavioral trajectories over the first 2 years
of life in infants exposed to opioids. As we recently completed enrollment, this aim is ongoing. We have
analyzed umbilical cord data showing that infants with prenatal opioid exposure are often exposed to other
psychotropic drugs, and are analyzing the effects of polysubstance exposure on newborn behavior.
Specific Aim 3: To determine how the home environment, maternal mental health, and parenting
modify trajectories of brain connectivity and neurodevelopment over the first two years of life. This
aim is also ongoing. We have published our data from maternal questionnaires showing that mothers with
opioid use during pregnancy experience more stigma in the healthcare environment, and that mothers in
our cohort with more depression and anxiety symptoms have poor quality attachment with their infants.
 Our progress so far in OBOE, with completion of enrollment and success at following this difficult
population, demonstrates ability to complete this study. Our centers have an excellent track record of enrollment
of high-risk infants in clinical studies with successful participant retention and follow-up to 2 years of age, with
trained certified examiners for neurodevelopment and established infrastructure for unsedated neonatal and
infant cranial MRI. We therefore anticipate successful completion of follow-up of the enrolled infants."

 The objective of this study is to determine if the polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) along with other melanoma driver
pathways, is a therapeutically actionable druggable target for melanoma management, and what are the
mechanisms and interacting partners of PLK4, during melanocytic transformation and neoplastic progression.
 Melanoma is a clinically challenging skin cancer, if not diagnosed early. Epidemiological and genomic data
suggest that BRAFV600E mutations may be the initiating lesion in melanocytic nevi; however, these mutations
alone are not sufficient for malignant transformation. Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and activation of other
oncogenic pathways are known to contribute to the neoplastic progression of melanocytes. In the recent past,
the treatment landscape for advanced melanoma management has seen dramatic changes with the approval
of new drugs such as BRAF inhibitors as well as immune-checkpoint inhibitors. However, these treatments are
linked with acquired resistance occurring in nearly 50% of patients. Therefore, novel mechanism-based
therapeutic approaches are needed for effective management of this dreaded neoplasm. Based on limited
number of recent studies, PLK4 is being considered as a potential druggable target for certain cancers. PLK4
inhibition has been shown to cause a failure of centriole and centrosome duplication, whereas its
overexpression results in excess centriole formation, which are sufficient to drive centrosome amplification
(CA) and genome instability that is linked to carcinogenesis. A recent study has suggested a role of PLK4 in
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via modulating PI3K/AKT pathway. We recently demonstrated that
PLK4 is significantly overexpressed in melanoma, and small molecule PLK4 inhibition resulted in a significant
anti-proliferative response in multiple melanoma cell lines [Mol Cancer Res, 2018]. Our preliminary data has
shown that PLK4 CRISPR K/O A375 melanoma cells show significantly decreased tumor growth in melanoma
xenografts suggesting an important role of PLK4 in melanoma. We also found that combined inhibition of PLK4
with BRAF and MEK inhibition exerted synergistic antiproliferative effect in melanoma cells. In this study, we
propose to challenge a hypothesis that PLK4 signaling, together with other driver pathways of melanocytic
transformation and neoplastic progression, will provide therapeutically-actionable novel co-targeting
approaches, for melanoma management. Three aims are proposed to; 1) determine the association between
PLK4 and other driver pathways of melanocytic transformation and neoplastic progression ex vivo; 2)
determine the functional and mechanistic significance of PLK4 in melanoma progression and metastasis in
vivo in a variety of human-relevant genetically engineered mouse models; 3) determine the therapeutic
significance of PLK4 inhibition, alone and in combination with other promising target-based anti-melanoma
modalities in vivo. We expect that our study will establish the exact role of PLK4 in melanoma, and its
diagnostic/prognostic as well as therapeutic significance in this neoplasm."

The proposal requests support for early-career investigators to attend the 2024 Gordon Research Conference
on Image Science (in its fifth offering). The unique feature of this conference compared with more conventional
medical imaging venues is the bringing together of renowned speakers from disparate application areas,
including biology, medicine, astronomy, remote sensing, and security and defense industries, in a forum that
encourages each to describe their most significant challenges and most promising solutions, to foster cross-
fertilization between these fields. All speakers are invited based on their field leadership and willingness to
debate fundamental issues shared by everyone developing, evaluating, and applying imaging in medicine and
biology. The GRC format in a small remote venue promotes innovative interdisciplinary thinking that leads to
breakthroughs. An environment where leading senior scientists debate core issues is valuable to young
investigators trying to build prosperous independent careers in medical imaging in industry and academia. All
attendees are invited to present a poster describing their research in poster sessions, a key element of the
Gordon Conference format.
The June 9-14, 2024, GRC conference theme is “Advances in Imaging and Visualization at the Junction of
Physics, Engineering, and Data Science.” which is focused on the appropriate acquisition and efficient uses of
the massive volume of imaging information now collected in many fields, in particular biomedical optical
imaging. Speakers give ~40-minute presentations in a single-track format with ~20 minutes of discussions
following each presentation that experts lead in the field. Biomedical-relevant topics range from “Live High-
speed Biomedical and Medical Imaging” to “Elastography in Biomedical and Medical Imaging” and “Eyes and
Vision.” Still, we also bring insight from sessions on Astronomy, Quantum Imaging, and Consumer Displays.”
At the center of each presentation is a discussion of the core challenges shared by image scientists and novel
techniques for acquiring and displaying information to maximize decision performance. We aim to build Image
Science as an independent field of study through detailed interdisciplinary discussions and by fostering the
success of a new generation of image scientists. The Image Science GRC will be complemented by the
student-run Image Science Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on June 7-8, 2024."
11000533,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The search for effective strategies to prevent or treat Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related
Dementias (AD/ADRD) is a global public health priority. This search has been exceptionally difficult, reflecting
the complex, multi-factorial processes culminating in AD/ADRD, diagnostic ambiguity, and the intrinsic
challenges of research on diseases of the brain. Methods in Longitudinal Research on Dementia (MELODEM)
is an international initiative to strengthen, harmonize, and promulgate analytic and design approaches for
AD/ADRD research. Launched in 2012, MELODEM convenes an international interdisciplinary group of
researchers (e.g., epidemiologists, neuropsychologists, neurologists, biostatisticians), across career stages, to
identify and address common methodologic challenges in quantitative research on AD/ADRD. These
methodologic challenges—such as selection/attrition, reverse causation, and measurement of cognition and
dementia—have the potential to bias estimates of the extent to which risk factors protect against AD/ADRD or
slow the progression of AD/ADRD. Some biases can be so extreme as to reverse the direction of estimated
effects (e.g., protective instead of harmful). For the past decade—the past 4 with support from an R13 award
from NIA—MELODEM has convened an annual in-person meeting of 30-40 researchers and twice-monthly
web-based meetings on methodologically themed topics. The proposed continuation of our R13 grant will
support annual in-person MELODEM meetings to foster development and dissemination of valid and rigorous
analytical approaches for quantitative research on the prevention and treatment of ADRD, with the goals of (a)
developing new methods when needed, (b) reaching consensus on “best practices” for analytic methods, and
(c) providing a platform to share and teach methods to early-career and established researchers. To continue
working towards rigorous analytical approaches and “best practices,” the MELODEM annual progress meeting
will include both “Data Workshops” and “Discussion Sessions” on topics relevant to current methodological
challenges in AD/ADRD research. The grant will also provide travel support for US researchers to participate in
the annual meeting and ancillary activities. Finally, to sustain the collaborations and ideas discussed during the
meeting, the grant will support post-meeting activities culminating in published reports from the collaborative
research stemming from the conference and connections with a broader group of researchers not able to
attend the meetings in person. These activities include web-based conference calls and small working group
meetings. Support for the proposed MELODEM meetings will strengthen quantitative research methods related
to AD/ADRD, foster a collaborative, interdisciplinary community addressing the most important technical
challenges, and promote rapid adoption of best practices for solving shared technical challenges in research
on prevention and treatment of AD/ADRD."
11000631,"PROJECT SUMMARY
West African countries suffer enormous impacts due to infectious diseases such as HIV, malaria, tuberculosis,
Lassa, Ebola and Dengue. Despite the high relevance of basic and clinical research studies and the abundant
availability of patient-derived samples and data, most of the sixteen West African nations lag behind developed
nations and many other African nations in combating these epidemics. As a result, it is increasingly recognized
that there is great value in increasing opportunities for West African scientists, particularly from countries such
as Sierra Leone, which have been slower to progress as compared to others like Ghana and Nigeria. One goal
is to have them participate more in basic and clinical research, both as independent researchers and as part of
international consortia and collaborations. Until now, however, there has been little opportunity to bring the entire
West African infectious disease research community together with leading researchers from other African nations
and beyond. For this reason, we propose to hold the first International West Africa Symposium and Workshop
on Infectious Diseases in Freetown, Sierra Leone. There are four specific objectives of this meeting. First, we
aim to bring together the international infectious disease community in Sierra Leone to facilitate infectious
disease research on numerous key pathogens highly relevant to the region. To accomplish this goal, we are
planning a series of keynote and plenary speakers from many leading experts in the field from within Africa and
around the world, along with a poster session, talks selected from poster abstracts and other activities including
a site visit. Since the challenges in this field are daunting and will require collaborative efforts to solve, a second
goal is to enhance interactions between diverse groups, such as academic basic science, epidemiological,
clinical and translational science, as well as non-governmental and governmental institutions. To this end, we
are specifically inviting participants representing these groups, with sessions to facilitate knowledge exchange
and collaborations. A third objective is to bring hands-on training and workshops that our team is uniquely
positioned to provide. To this end, there will be several days of workshops taught by experts and developed in
close collaboration with team members on the ground in Sierra Leone, who understand the local needs. A fourth
objective is to invest intellectually and financially in the future by supporting promising young trainees. The goal
is to encourage trainees to be successful and stay in the field by providing intellectual support through
discussions and mentorship with senior scientists, poster sessions, opportunities to speak, awards that recognize
their achievements, and by providing financial support with competitive travel awards. The expected outcomes
are increased collaborations between scientists working in different disciplines, retention of young scientists in
the field, identification of new opportunities to mesh basic and clinical research, and exploration of new
approaches for the study of infectious diseases and strategies to combat them."

 The proposed renewal application seeks a second five years of funding to support the Advancing
Diversity in Aging Research (ADAR) Summit (5R13AG066389), which brings together students and principal
investigators from the successful NIA-funded MSTEM: Advancing Diversity in Aging Research (ADAR) through
Undergraduate Education (R25) programs (PAR-12-016, PAR-17-290, and PAR-20-317). ADAR programs in
MSTEM and aging were launched in 2012 with the overarching goal “to support educational activities that
encourage individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those from groups underrepresented in the
biomedical and behavioral sciences, to pursue further studies or careers in research.” This program is part of
NIA’s coordinated effort to a) fill a gap in the pipeline transitioning from undergraduate to graduate education in
aging as it relates to medicine and STEM and b) fulfill the objectives of the NIA Health Disparities Strategic Plan.
The motivation to hold annual meetings for students participating in the ADAR program is based on extensive
research demonstrating the importance of the following in retaining historically underrepresented students in
science: a) taking ownership of their research by presenting findings in a safe, non-threatening, and supportive
environment; b) creating a supportive community where students have a sense of belonging and are supported
in their identify as scientists, c) networking where students are empowered to view themselves as capable
learners through the interpersonal validation they receive from URM senior faculty and peers; d) seeing role
models of established and peer adjacent URM scholars sharing their path to becoming research scientists; and
e) participating in professional development activities. The annual ADAR Summit meets each of these criteria.
 The ADAR Summit also enables students to engage in the broader scientific community, as the Summit is
held immediately before the annual meeting of the Gerontology Society of America (GSA). Partial support from
the GSA has enabled ADAR students to participate in the Presidential Symposium Poster Sessions, attend
presentations relevant to their field, and visit the Exhibition Hall, where many graduate/professional schools have
booths where students can engage with program representatives. The Summit also supports PIs to meet
annually.
 The ultimate goal of the ADAR Summit conference series is to help solidify the identity of ADAR
undergraduate students as scientists in MSTEM and aging. The ADAR Summit is an important strategy for the
retention of diverse scholars in budding research careers. Ultimately, the goal is to have a research community of
scientists that is representative of the overall United States population to more accurately address health issues
of the 21st century and beyond."

Central to the mission of the Fertility and Infertility Branch of NICHD is advancing women's reproductive health
through support for basic and translational research. The XXIII Ovarian Workshop serves as a dynamic platform
for fostering collaboration and sharing research progress among basic science researchers, clinicians, and
trainees in the field of ovarian biology and pathobiology. This R13 sponsors an international symposium as a
preconference workshop to the Society for the Study of Reproduction's (SSR) Annual Meeting, and features
eleven distinguished speakers from five countries. The workshop focuses on cutting-edge ovarian biology
research, emphasizing emerging technologies to explore communication between key ovary cell types
necessary for female fertility. The program topics include updates on the NICHD-funded Human BioMolecular
Atlas Program (HuBMAP), bioengineering for ovarian follicle signaling, novel methods for species conservation,
improvements in imaging technologies, and new facets to ovarian aging. The Ovarian Workshop promotes
diversity and inclusion by inviting active participation from diverse individuals. Previous Ovarian Workshops have
hosted speakers and attendees with diverse perspectives across geography, gender, race, ethnicity and career
stages. Our slate of confirmed speakers continues with this legacy and encourages interdisciplinary
collaboration. The Ovarian Workshop aims to (1) provide a forum for sharing recent breakthroughs in ovarian
biology focusing on advancements in cell-cell communication and innovative technologies, (2) facilitate scientific
interaction and collaboration among colleagues and trainees, promoting professional development at all levels,
to meet the increasing need for research in ovarian biology and health for individuals with ovaries, and (3) offer
a forum for trainee and junior investigator engagement and promote inclusivity in ovarian research by
encouraging participation by individuals typically underrepresented in science as a mechanism to further their
professional development. These goals will be met through interactive sessions, panel discussions, and
networking opportunities. Trainees will showcase their research in a dedicated Rising Star session, fostering
valuable networking and mentoring. Highlights from this Ovarian Workshop will be published in the SSR journal,
Biology of Reproduction, co-authored by the organizers. By uniting experts and prioritizing trainee involvement,
the Ovarian Workshop will cultivate a vibrant, inclusive community dedicated to advancing ovarian research as
a foundation to female reproduction and overall health. The conference is anticipated to influence research
directions, foster new and strengthen prior collaborations, and contribute to mentorship for the next generation
of ovarian biology researchers and thought leaders."

Because influenza pandemics occur with little warning, vaccine development and distribution take place at a
slower timescale than transmission of the emergent strain. Similarly, although seasonal influenza epidemics
occur annually, they are also notoriously difficult to predict, and necessitate rapid response to changing
circumstances. While vaccination, antivirals and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are available to
mitigate these challenges, imperfect protection and coverage mean that their direct and indirect protective
benefits are conditional on the state of immunity in the population. Therefore, the overall objective of this
application is to develop a sustainable, scalable pipeline of analytic, predictive, and visualization tools to
translate detailed clinical and cohort data to into timely population-level guidance on vaccination, antiviral use,
and NPIs. We will accomplish these goals through the following specific aims: Aim 1) We will use the extensive
clinical and cohort data resources generated by the Michigan Influenza Center to identify and address key
questions in influenza prevention and control; Aim 2) We will integrate these multiple sources of data using
statistical and simulation based models of infectious disease transmission. Specifically, we will Aim 2A) use
robust models of longitudinal serologic data to characterize response to natural infection and vaccination, and
then in Aim 2B) integrate this information into household-based transmission models to understand the impact
of these immune responses on susceptibility to influenza infection. Using the predictions of these individual-
level models parameterized using longitudinal cohort data, in Aim 2C) we will construct synthetic cohorts
representative of the age-specific distribution of immunity in different populations, e.g. the State of Michigan,
and use these data to develop targeted population-level strategies for influenza vaccination. In Aim 2D) we will
then apply the insights of these models to the layered application of antivirals and NPIs in an influenza
pandemic using a network-based simulation platform we have developed. All of these models will be designed,
implemented and analyzed in collaboration with CDC and other partners to ensure clearly-articulated
guidelines for modeling assumptions and inputs (Aim 3). This will be augmented by tools for automated model
verification, validation and synthesis which will ensure adherence to these standards and integrate the findings
of multiple modeling groups (Aims 4 & 5). All of these tools will be released publicly as open-source software
and interactive tools. All of these products will be implemented with the goal of communicating key findings as
well as uncertainty in model inputs, structure, and outcomes as clearly as possible to a wide array of scientific
and policy-focused stakeholders using state-of-the-art tools for data visualization (Aims 6,7 & 8). The outcome
of this project will be the development of a validated, systematic and collaborative modeling approach tailored
for rapid evaluation of both pandemic and seasonal influenza mitigation strategies."

The increasing rates of suicide among adolescents is an urgent public health concern. In parallel, acute
services due to suicide risk, including psychiatric hospitalizations, have been on the rise, with discharged
adolescents remaining at elevated risk for recurrent suicidal crises. New approaches are urgently needed to
alter risk trajectories and prevent suicidal behavior among adolescents transitioning from inpatient care.
Bridging an adaptive intervention (AI) approach—wherein type, intensity, and timing of treatment can be
individualized to address suicidal adolescents’ heterogenous treatment needs—together with technology-
augmented follow-up support provided during the high-risk transition period, this study seeks to identify an
effective AI for reducing youth suicidal behavior after inpatient care. In our ongoing full-scale sequential
multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) of a multi-component intervention—i.e. incorporating a
Motivational Interview (MI)-enhanced safety plan delivered during hospitalization (MI-SP) and post-discharge
supportive contacts provided via a booster call, asynchronous portal, or text messages (Texts)—hospitalized
adolescents (N=300) at risk for suicide are initially randomized to MI-SP or to MI-SP with Texts, and those
classified as non-responders within 2 weeks post discharge are re-randomized to an added booster call or
portal conditions. The R01 SMART was funded to determine the effectiveness of promising technology-
augmented intervention strategies and their sequencing, including comparing four AIs embedded in the
SMART, on the primary outcome of suicidal behavior (actual, interrupted, aborted attempts) within 3 months
post discharge and secondary outcomes of time-to-suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation severity over 6
months. In secondary analyses, we plan to investigate moderators of intervention strategies, examine
proposed mechanisms of action, and identify barriers and facilitators to implementation. The trial was
successfully launched across two health system sites; however the overall rate of recruitment across both sites
has been lower than expected, and further compounded by lower number of admissions at one of the sites. To
address these challenges and enrollment shortfalls that would limit the study’s statistical power to determine
the effectiveness and optimal sequence of different intervention strategies on the primary outcome of suicidal
behavior, we recently added an additional recruitment site–Cincinnati Children’s Hospital and Medical Center
(CCHMC). CCMHC was selected due to its relatively large child/adolescent inpatient program and diverse
patient population (~30% Black youth). We have made important study launch gains at CCHM, including
completing regulatory and study startup steps and staff training, with trial enrollment beginning midway through
Year 3. This supplement will enable completing enrollment and associated intervention and follow-up activities
at CCHM in Year 4 as well as intervention implementation planning goals in Year 5. With the addition of CCHM
as a recruitment site, the study is well-positioned to achieve its target enrollment goals and meet its aims."

We propose to study how the innate response to virus changes as children mature, which we theorize
contributes to asthma remission. Although asthma is a chronic disease, its symptoms vary greatly based on
the season, time of day, and age. Asthma seasonality is driven by respiratory virus outbreaks2, 3. Time-of-day
variations arise from the circadian clock, which regulates lung remodeling after respiratory viral infection4-6. The
least understood is why age affects asthma activity, and particularly why asthma exacerbations gradually
resolve in 50% of children as they mature7, 8. Understanding the biological processes that cause asthma
resolution in children could yield ways of promoting remission in all patients. We hypothesize that asthmatic
children experience fewer asthma exacerbations as they age because they develop a pro-resolution response
to viruses, preventing new type-2 inflammation and airway remodeling from forming with each new infection.
We further hypothesize that circadian clocks operating within alveolar macrophages (AMs) and airway
epithelial cells are critical for this pro-resolution response. Our hypotheses arise from observations that, in
children, viruses become less potent at triggering asthma exacerbations as children mature. In mice,
respiratory viral infections that produce chronic lung remodeling in juvenile animals fail to do so in adults. The
protection afforded by adult age correlates with a blunted type 2 inflammatory response to viruses. AMs are
required for adult protection from post-viral lung disease and exhibit a distinct transcriptional and
immunophenotypic profile. Protection is also marked by reduced accumulation of dysplastic Krt17+ basal cells
after respiratory viral infection. Finally, these age-related benefits are negated by circadian clock disruption,
leading otherwise protected adult mice to develop chronic post-viral lung disease like juveniles. This project will
clarify how the circadian clock mediates the adult age, pro-resolution response to viral asthma triggers.
Proposed experiments in mice use Sendai virus (SeV) as a viral model of asthmatic lung remodeling and
Alternaria alternata extract as an allergic model that serves as a comparator. We will employ complementary
genetic and environmental methods to disrupt circadian clock function (clock gene Bmal1 deletion and chronic
jet lag or CJL). Aim 1 focuses on how the adult-age AM clock promotes the resolution of viral inflammation.
Aim 2 focuses on how the adult-age epithelial clock promotes the normal repair of viral airway injury. We will
analyze antiviral function in airway cells from asthma remission patients for the first time. This project aligns
with NIH research priorities and satisfies the recent Notice of Special Interest NOT-HL-22-043: Basic and
Translational Research on Circadian Regulation of Heart, Lung, Blood, and Sleep Disorders."

In the United States, 1 in 9 individuals 65 and older and one third of individuals 85 and older have
Alzheimer’s dementia (AD). By age 70, age-related cognitive decline is nearly ubiquitous with signs of mild
cognitive impairment in a large portion of older adults. Exercise is a promising intervention to mitigate cognitive
decline in older adults, however response to exercise varies. Epigenetic age, particularly accelerated
epigenetic aging, has been linked to neurodegenerative disorders including AD, other types of dementia and
cognitive aging. Understanding the impact of social determinants of health (SDoH) on epigenetic aging is
gaining momentum with several studies implicating cumulative lifetime stress, lifestyle, early life adversity, and
neighborhood context with epigenetic age acceleration. The impact of exercise on DNA methylation is well
established and its impact on epigenetic aging is a burgeoning area of research. Elucidating biologic
underpinnings related to variability in cognitive function (CF), brain health (BH), biomarkers of AD, and
response to exercise are necessary to improve mitigation of age-related cognitive decline. The overarching
hypothesis for this project is that heterogeneity of biological aging explains variation in CF, BH, biomarkers of
AD, and response to exercise in non-cognitively impaired older adults. This project will be accomplished by
harnessing the data and biospecimens collected through the Investigating Gains in Neurocognition in an
Intervention Trial of exercise (IGNITE) project. Participants (n=648) were 65-80 years old, community dwelling,
not cognitively impaired individuals who exercised <20 minutes/week. Participants were randomized to a 12
month intervention to 1 of 3 groups: group 1=150 minutes/week moderate intensity aerobic exercise; group
2=225 minutes/week moderate intensity aerobic exercise; group 3=light intensity stretching 150 minutes/week
(control). An extensive cognitive function battery and blood were collected at baseline (month 0), midpoint
(month 6) and completion (month 12) of intervention, neuroimaging at 0 and 12 months, amyloid β at month 0
and AD biomarkers at month 0 and 12. Data on lifestyle and social determinants of health were also collected.
The aims of this study are to determine the effect of epigenetic age acceleration on CF, BH, and biomarkers of
AD in older adults; determine the effect of a dose response moderate intensity exercise intervention on
epigenetic age acceleration in older adults; examine the role of epigenetic age acceleration CF, BH, and
biomarkers of AD in older adults within the context of a 12-month dose-response exercise intervention; and
examine the effects of SDoH and their interaction with epigenetic age acceleration on CF, BH, and biomarkers
of AD in older adults within the context of a 12-month dose-response exercise intervention."
10980241,"Abstract: Wilson disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism present in 1:30,000 due to
reduced biliary copper excretion and pathologic copper accumulation in the liver and later in extrahepatic sites.
Despite 60 years of available medical therapy, there are unmet needs and a significant burden of disease
(disability, liver transplant or death) due to late diagnosis, treatment non-adherence and issues with monitoring.
Given its rarity and wide-ranging phenotype, we created a WD patient registry and biospecimen repository
sponsored by the Wilson Disease Association, a patient advocacy organization, to study the natural history of
WD and search for biomarkers. In collaboration with the Regional Laboratory for Metal Analysis (Surrey, UK)
directed by Dr. Harrington, an innovative method was developed for testing blood samples for “bioavailable” or
non-ceruloplasmin bound copper measured accurately (ANCC) to determine a patient’s “copper status”. We
aim to establish ranges for ANCC for patients with WD in different phases of treatment by showing that
ANCC is elevated in untreated patients and with treatment failure or non-adherence, and that ANCC decreases
with treatment. We will test whether ANCC is a biomarker for treatment target and prognostic indicator
for treatment outcome for WD by correlating ANCC with patient clinical outcomes. This will help determine
whether ANCC is useful for guiding treatment and for patient prognostication, or whether a matrix of
biochemical and clinical measures is needed. We also plan exploratory studies to determine if urinary
copper excretion measured after treatment interruption for patients on different therapies for their WD
correlates with ANCC, as this alternative measurement may be a cost-effective option superior to currently
used on-treatment 24 h urine copper studies for managing WD therapy. WD is managed most frequently by
liver specialists given frequent injury to the liver in this disorder, but multidisciplinary care of patients is
important given the extrahepatic features of the disease that impact a patient’s quality of life. Having a
biomarker such as ANCC for clinical use as a surrogate for the state of a WD patient’s disease would be
extremely useful and help to avoid treatment errors when treatment dosing or choice of therapy is based on 24
h urine copper excretion results alone due to confounders for this measurement. With respect to future clinical
studies for WD, as it is no longer acceptable to use survival alone as a study endpoint, we must define
clinically meaningful endpoints, optimize treatments to achieve best clinical outcomes and enhance patient
quality of life, and evaluate cost effectiveness of current and future therapies. Benefits of these studies outside
of WD will be the bettering of our understanding of human copper metabolism and establishment of useful
assays for assessing copper status and their expected ranges in health and disease. With recent discoveries
of the critical role that copper plays in cell metabolism and cell survival, furthering our ability to measure
“copper status” using potential biomarkers like ANCC have an even larger importance beyond WD."

Chronic Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (CHB) affects hundreds of millions of people across
the world. Despite effective vaccines, and antiviral therapies that can suppress viral replication,
these infections are largely incurable, and new therapies for CHB are desperately needed. We
have investigated gene editing using targeted nucleases to cleave covalently closed circular
DNA (cccDNA), the template for HBV replication, which results in its degradation or inactivation
in infected hepatocytes. Our work and the work of others has been hindered due to the fact that
existing small animal models for HBV have substantial limitations, or are complex and
expensive to establish. To this end, we established and validated a robust and low-cost liver
humanized NSG-PiZ mouse as a model for the study of HBV. Here we propose to use these
mice for the evaluation of novel curative gene editing therapies that target CHB.
 Specific Aim 1. Evaluate the anti-HBV efficacy of HBV gene therapy in liver-humanized
NSG-PiZ mice. We will first evaluate the efficiency of HBV gene editing in NSG-PiZ mice, using
AAV-SaCas9 vectors we previously validated in HBV-infected humanized FRG mice. We will
then compare lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery of nuclease mRNA with AAV vectors for the
transduction of PHH in our model. We will compare the antiviral efficacy of different classes of
gene editing nuclease in our NSG-PiZ mouse model of CHB, and evaluate chromatin modifying
agents for their ability to make cccDNA accessible to gene editing nucleases in vitro and in vivo.
Finally, we will assess combined gene-editing, reverse transcriptase inhibitor (RTi), and entry
inhibitor antiviral therapy in our model of CHB.
 Specific Aim 2. Evaluate the tolerability and host genomic consequences of AAV- and
LNP-delivered nuclease therapies targeting HBV in liver-humanized NSG-PiZ mice. We will first
determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and minimal effective dose for AAV-nuclease
and LNP-nuclease therapies in our CHB model. We will then monitor the effects of different
nuclease classes on treatment-related off-target genotoxicity in vivo and determine whether use
of liver-specific promoters can mitigate therapy-associated genotoxicity. We will also determine
whether therapy-associated genotoxicity is reduced when nuclease expression is transiently
provided by LNPs. Finally, we will evaluate therapy-specific immune responses and therapy-
associated hepatotoxicity and neurotoxicity after transient or persistent nuclease expression in
immunocompetent mice."

Breast cancer is a leading cause of death in the U.S. and a major public health burden as one woman out of
eight will receive a diagnosis in her lifetime. Advances in DNA genotyping and sequencing technologies have
led to the identification of >300 germline variants that contribute to breast cancer risk. However, as of today,
large ‘omics’ studies include women of mostly European ancestry even though preliminary evidence indicates
that there is a clear benefit in studying genetically diverse samples. A genome wide association study (GWAS)
in Hispanic/Latina (H/L) women with one tenth of the number of individuals included in previous studies led to
the discovery of protective variants only present in populations that have Indigenous American ancestry. These
variants significantly add to the predictive accuracy of breast cancer polygenic risk scores (PRS). H/L represent
16% of the U.S. population and in some states, up to 37%. To address the lack of H/L representation in genomics
studies, we have created the Latin America genomics of breast cancer (LAGENO-BC) consortium, which
includes ~28,500 Latin American breast cancer patients and ~32,600 unaffected women from 11 different
countries and the U.S. diaspora. Our goal is to study the Latin American-specific genetic architecture of breast
cancer and develop predictive models that account for variation by ancestry and geography. By combining
existing studies, LAGENO-BC quadruples the prior H/L BC GWAS sample size and consequently, provides the
power required for the discovery of additional variants contributing to breast cancer risk and for improving the
predictive power of PRS for risk stratification in those populations. In the first aim, we propose to discover
susceptibility loci and genes associated with breast cancer in H/Ls by conducting GWAS and ancestry-matched
multi-tissue model-based transcriptome wide association studies with readily available RNA sequence data
(TWASs). These analyses will be repeated for overall risk and subtype-specific risk. In the second aim, we will
use known and new genetic risk variants to improve breast cancer risk prediction using ancestry-aware
approaches and integrating existing models based on non-genetic risk factors. This work is expected to result in
the discovery of new risk variants that are especially relevant to populations with an admixed Indigenous
American ancestral background. In addition, utilizing ancestry-matched and multi-tissue models for TWAS, new
associations linked to ancestry- specific and tissue-specific eQTLs are expected to be uncovered. It is also
expected that PRS scores that incorporate H/Ls variants and assess regional and ancestry heterogeneity will be
more predictive than a one-size-fits-all approach. Beyond the proposed work in this application, LAGENO-BC is
building up a resource that will serve as a foundation for future collaborative studies addressing a broad range
of scientific questions related to breast cancer genetics in H/L populations."

Lipodystrophy is a disorder characterized by adipose tissue loss and redistribution, with
associated metabolic complications including diabetes. The most common form of monogenic
lipodystrophy is familial partial lipodystrophy type 2 (FPLD2), which is caused by a mutation in
the LMNA gene, encoding nuclear lamins A and C. The mechanisms for how adipose tissues
are lost, after developing normally through adolescence are unknown. To address this shortfall,
we selectively deleted Lmna in adipocytes (LmnaADKO) of mice. We observed a striking loss of
white adipose tissue in adult LmnaADKO mice, along with increased fat deposition in the liver,
elevated blood glucose levels in both fasting and fed states, increased circulating insulin levels
compared to the Lmnafl/fl controls. Analyses of young mice revealed development of white
adipose tissue in LmnaADKO mice, which is progressively lost coincident with puberty. These
phenotypes closely mirror those observed in human patients with FPLD2. To further investigate
the function of lamin A/C in adipose tissue and mechanisms by which adipocytes are lost, we
have now developed inducible LmnaiADKO mice as well as six knock-in mouse lines, each
containing a pathological variant that causes lipodystrophy. We hypothesize that lamin A/C is
required to maintain mature adipocyte characteristics, and we will ascertain molecular and
cellular mechanisms that underly loss of mature adipocytes in mouse models and human
patients. To test our hypotheses, we propose 1) to characterize seven lines of mice that contain
lipodystrophic variants across Lmna, and test whether mechanisms of adipocyte loss in these
mice reflect those found in inducible LmnaADKO mice, as well as in human patients with FPLD2.
2) to study effects of LMNA variant on adipocyte and nuclear morphology, gene expression,
cellular composition of adipose tissue depots, and chromatin architecture longitudinally in young
patients who do not have all signs of disease, and in healthy controls and parents with FPLD2."
10980893,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) remain among the most lethal cancers, with a 5-
year survival rate of ~20%. Present in 1-6% of the general population, Barrett’s Esophagus (BE) has been
identified as the definitive precursor lesion, but confers a risk of progression at an astoundingly low rate of
0.12% per year. Despite identification of multiple clinical risk factors for progression, such factors alone are not
sufficient to explain why so few individuals subsequently develop high-grade dysplasia and adenocarcinoma.
Extensive somatic genomic characterization of non-dysplastic Barrett’s Esophagus and EAC have
demonstrated that early acquisition of TP53 mutations (prevalence 70-83%) and subsequent genome doubling,
aneuploidy, and/or chromothriptic events as genomic hallmarks of BE progression. However, these somatic
alterations have not yielded insight to why so few individuals with BE progress to dysplasia, or account for the
25-30% of tumors with wildtype TP53. Our robust preliminary data from 742 BE progressors reveal that
individuals who progress are enriched with pathogenic germline mutations in cancer-predisposing genes
associated with multicancer susceptibility, and that these inheritable mutations can shape the somatic
mutanome in Barrett’s esophagus. Moreover, these germline mutations are enriched in TP53 wildtype tumors.
In Aim #1, we seek to provide more precise risk estimates of germline alterations occurring in two prevalent
genes associated with TP53-wildtype tumor development, ATM and BRCA2. In Aim #2, we assess if
introduction of heterozygosity of ATM and BRCA2, the most commonly mutated genes that demonstrate
mutual exclusivity with TP53, into nondysplastic BE organoids accelerate accumulation of copy number
alterations. In Aim #3, we perform single-cell copy number analysis of BE from BRCA2 and ATM mutation
carriers to see if such individuals demonstrate increased subchromosomal aneuploidy compared to matched
controls. Understanding how enriched germline driver mutations, particularly those that remain heterozygous in
Barrett’s esophagus and retain wildtype TP53 acquire high-risk genomic features is critical for comprehensive
risk assessment, biomarker design, and chemoprevention efforts."

Cryptosporidium is an enigmatic apicomplexan protist pathogen. It has completely lost its ability to synthesize
purines and pyrimidines and must rely completely on salvage from the host in order to replicate its genome and
express its genes. Whether it is correlation or causation, Cryptosporidium has evolved to have among the
smallest genome sequences in the phylum at 9.12 Mb and 3930 protein-encoding genes, with 4843 genes total.
Recently we identified polycistronic transcription in C. parvum. 423 protein-encoding genes are observed in 201
polycistronic transcripts in sporozoites. These polycistronic transcripts have been confirmed with multiple
alternative approaches including RT-PCR confirmation of full transcripts containing as many as 4 genes. They
are not read-through artifacts. Polycistronic transcription has never been reported in the Apicomplexa until now.
 Cryptosporidium is an early branching apicomplexan most closely related to gregarines. It is a major
cause of diarrhea in both industrialized and developing nations, especially in the immunocompromised and
infants in their first year of life. Transcriptome analyses have shown that nearly all genes in Cryptosporidium
overlap in their untranslated regions regardless of the strand on which they are encoded. Thus, single-molecule
long-read sequencing is necessary to determine transcript boundaries. Transcriptome analyses also revealed
that antisense coding and non-coding RNA genes are rampant. Cryptosporidium is clearly expressing genes
from both DNA strands at many loci, especially in polycistronic transcripts. Interestingly, we often, but not always,
observe polycistronic transcriptional units and one or more of their internal monocistronic transcripts at the same
time. Do the internal monocistronic RNAs represent independent transcriptional units, or might they be
processed from the larger polycistronic transcripts? We are curious about this new form of gene regulation in the
Apicomplexa. To address gene regulation involving polycistronic transcripts, we will examine both transcriptional
and translational aspects of gene regulation using in vitro cell and organoid culture as appropriate. Together with
collaborators, we will also generate a polycistronic transfection construct that will be useful for the functional
dissection of transcription and translation of polycistronic gene regulation. There is significant new gene
regulation and post-transcriptional regulation biology to be learned for these important pathogens that can also
be used for many purposes, including to better inform the design and integration location of transgenes in the
community’s quest to develop better genetic tools for dissection of Cryptosporidium infection biology."

Adult neurons in the central nervous system fail to regenerate after spinal cord injury (SCI). Large-scale
screens performed in vitro and in vivo have identified many genes that regulate axonal regeneration,
including PTEN, SOCS3, c-Myc, the KLF family of transcription factors, and more. In the optic nerve model,
the greatest enhancement of axonal regeneration is achieved by targeting multiple genes in combination,
such as co-deletion of PTEN and SOCS3, or PTEN deletion combined with overexpression of c-Myc and
CNTF. However, no screens have systematically compared the combined knockdown or overexpression of
different gene combinations, and the power of large in vivo screens may be limited by the need to
individually test every candidate and between-subject variability. In this study, we propose to perform the
first pooled in vivo screening of regenerative combination therapies in a mouse model of SCI, which could
identify new combinations of genetic targets that more potently enhance both the number of regenerating
axons and the distance of axonal regeneration after SCI.
We will employ newly available tools for genetic knockout and overexpression to efficiently perform multiple
in vivo screens, using a Cre-dependent barcode and next-generation DNA sequencing to simultaneously
compare a pooled library of 36 candidates in a single animal. Our proposal is divided into two Aims. Aim 1
will use CRISPR to first compare the genetic knockout of 36 individual candidate genes that are known to
limit axonal regeneration. After identifying the 9 individual knockouts that most potently enhance
regeneration, we will then screen every possible pair of the top 9 gene knockouts in combination. Aim 2 will
first compare the overexpression of 36 individual candidate genes that are known to promote regeneration.
We will then combine the 6 most effective overexpressed genes with the 6 most effective knockout pairs to
screen 36 unique combinations of one overexpressed gene and two gene knockouts. Every screen will use
a pooled library to directly compare all 36 candidates within the same animal. To our knowledge, systematic
screening of multiple gene knockouts, or of combined knockout and overexpression, has not been
previously performed in any model of axonal regeneration. Future studies will evaluate the functional benefit
of the most effective combination therapies in a clinically relevant SCI model. We thus propose a new
method for pooled in vivo screening of genetic therapies for SCI, which could identify new translational
combination therapies that enhance axonal regeneration and improve functional recovery."
10994420,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Across the animal kingdom, specialized neurosecretory cells coordinate endocrine and central nervous system
signals to construct neural circuits and maintain homeostasis. Insulin/insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are key
secreted neuropeptides whose signaling activities are strictly regulated by IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs).
Despite misregulated insulin/IGF signaling (IIS) being linked to the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental
disorders, the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which IGFBPs precisely tune IGF activity in the brain to
sculpt neural circuits and modulate behavioral outputs are largely undefined. The Drosophila system provides
an appealing model to address these questions given only two IGFBPs are encoded in the fly genome, Imp-L2
and Crimpy. Our lab discovered Crimpy and defined its role in facilitating TGFβ signaling at the peripheral
neuromuscular junction, but its roles in the central brain and IGF regulation are completely unexplored. Our
preliminary data suggest that Crimpy is required for axon morphogenesis and circuit formation of the
mushroom body, the fly learning and memory center. We also demonstrated that Crimpy is required to promote
wild-type sleep behavior. Notably, Crimpy’s cellular requirements for axon morphogenesis and sleep regulation
were mapped to a cluster of 14 neurosecretory cells at the brain midline, termed insulin producing cells (IPCs),
which produce and secrete insulin-like peptides/IGFs. Based on these results, we hypothesize that Crimpy
tunes IGF signaling from IPCs to promote proper central brain circuit development and function.
Through the use of innovative genetic schemes, immunocytochemistry, as well as behavioral and
electrophysiological analyses, this proposal seeks to: 1) establish roles for Crimpy in IPCs for central brain
morphogenesis and circuit formation, 2) assess Crimpy’s function in IPCs to promote wakefulness, and 3)
define Crimpy’s regulatory actions on IGF activity/IIS. These studies will provide novel mechanistic insight into
the regulatory mechanisms governing IGF activity to fill fundamental gaps in our understanding of IIS in
constructing neural circuits and modulating behavior. In addition, these proposed goals and approaches will
provide exceptional training opportunities to strengthen my technical and professional skills, and prepare me
for independence as I advance in my scientific career."

innovative, high-impact research goals. For example, we propose to (1) develop the first generalizable
technology to measure the movement of PAHs to and from Superfund sites, (2) measure external exposures
to PAHs for individuals near Superfund sites and determine how their exposures vary as a function of
location, (3) predict the secondary transformation products of PAHs that will form during biotic and abiotic
remediation at Superfund sites, (4) predict the toxicity of complex PAH mixtures using zebrafish, (5) link
PAH exposure to health outcomes with the aid of a powerful human in vitro respiratory model, and (6)
elucidate metabolic and physicochemical control of PAH susceptibility in toxicity systems. The cores will (1)
direct the activities of the SRP and disseminate our findings to stakeholders (Administrative), (2) work with
communities impacted by PAH exposure to address concerns and reduce risk (Community Engagement); (3)
provide intensive multi-disciplinary training for the next generation of Environmental Health Scientists
(RETCC), (4) provide data management and analysis support (DMAC), and (5) apply state-of- the-art
chemistry instrumentation and approaches to measure PAHs and PAH mixtures found in environmental and
biological matrices. By accomplishing these goals, we will advance the frontiers of science and also improve
the quality of life for impacted communities."
10994516,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Schizophrenia (SZ), and related psychotic disorders, affects about 1% of the global population and is
associated with highly increased rates of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer compared to the
general population. Greater obesity severity and prevalence in this population are the primary contributors to
these increased risks. While antipsychotic (AP) treatment is a known contributor to weight gain, the
neurobiology underlying this and other contributing factors are largely unknown. Without an improved
understanding of the neurobiology of obesity in SZ, developing targeted treatments remains challenging.
A framework that may be useful in understanding this neurobiology is the ""Triple Network Theory"" of SZ, which
postulates that disruptions in three brain networks (default mode, executive control, and salience networks)
heavily contribute to SZ pathophysiology. Disruption of these networks are similarly strongly associated with
obesity severity in the general population. This proposal, therefore, aims to determine how disruptions in the
“triple network” in SZ contributes to the observed increased obesity risk.
Associations between triple-network disruptions and obesity in SZ will be assessed with functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements of brain connectivity within the “triple network” in individuals with and
without SZ. Connectivity will be measured at rest and during visual food cues, both before and after consuming
a meal. Machine learning analyses will measure how AP-related weight gain correlates with disruptions in the
triple network in SZ, how obesity relates to these disruptions in individuals with and without SZ, and how other
factors (i.e., appetite-related hormones, eating behaviors, and mood ratings) may influence these relationships.
Mr. Dodd’s training plan focuses on the neurobiology of obesity and psychiatric disorders, advanced
neuroimaging analysis, and professional development (see Training Plan). He will be supported by mentors
with relevant expertise, as well as state-of-the-art resources in obesity, neuroimaging, and psychiatry research
at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. This training will support both this proposal and his
career goal to become a neuroimaging physician-scientist investigating the neurobiology of psychiatric
conditions and their comorbidities.
The research conducted during this training has the potential for high clinical impact. Determining how the
Triple Network Theory relates to obesity in SZ, and related psychotic disorders, may lead to improved
treatment development and targeting for obesity and obesity-related comorbidities for this population."
10978752,"Recent years have seen a surge of interest in the role of NAD in human disease and whether increasing NAD
with supplements such as nicotinamide riboside (NR) or nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) has therapeutic
value. However, our understanding of NAD and its metabolites in vivo is limited by technical barriers, a lack
of consensus on analytical techniques, and incomplete knowledge of the catabolic routes taken when NAD
breaks down under various stressed states. For many studies, blood and urine are the only samples available
to investigative teams. Whole blood contains NAD(P)(H), but poses important stability considerations for
handling and measurements. Serum and urine are relatively stable, but contain mostly catabolites of NAD,
which themselves carry implications for NAD metabolism in the rest of the body. Here we propose to take
advantage of a multidisciplinary team to develop and standardize methods for the analysis of NAD, as well
as NADH, NADP, NADPH that are suitable for human clinical trials. These include extensive validation and
testing of methods for determining the abundance of NAD(P)(H) in blood-derived samples and comparisons
between liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based assays, biochemical assays, and nuclear

1 and 2, we will focus primarily on method development, establishing techniques for the optimal handling and
storage of blood, as well as comparing the available methodology for NAD(P)(H) measurement. In years 3-5,
we will conduct a human clinical trial, examining NAD(P)(H) levels in tissues and blood, along with catabolite
levels in serum and urine before and after an intervention with nicotinamide riboside, thought to increase
whole blood and tissue NAD levels. By performing all of these assays in the same individuals, we will also
provide the first comprehensive assessment of the value of accessible bodily fluids for predicting tissue NAD
levels and, more broadly, for detecting physiologically relevant alterations in human NAD metabolism.

10978870,"Project Summary:
 We have patented a novel polymer-based in vivo-delivery platform for therapeutic antibodies using a super-
hydrophilic polymer, poly 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (PMPC) (US20220175857). This platform
provides the following features to any antibodies tested: i) prolonged body circulation, ii) specific delivery
irrespective of the target locations in the body, iii) protection from the environment and immune surveillance,
and iv) selected release at specific locations upon response to the environment. In addition, this platform grants
penetrable features to the central nervous system (CNS) and the lymph nodes (LNs), where antibody delivery is
greatly challenging. Anti-cancer antibody directing CD20, rituximab, allowed for the complete elimination of
systemically metastasized B-cell lymphomas, which are in the CNS and LNs, via engineering with this platform
(nRTX). Moreover, animals treated with nRTX evoked a potent anti-cancer immune response through the
efficient release of tumor-specific antigens within the LNs. Importantly, this platform has achieved the safe
delivery of rituximab in mice, rats, and non-human primates. This year, nRTX has been selected as a
collaborator project for the Nanotechnology Characterization Laboratory program toward its clinical translation.
 Very recently, we successfully simplified this platform for further smooth clinical translation using trastuzumab
– a HER2-directing monoclonal antibody – without impairing most features listed above (provisional patent#:
63/579,586). The primary difference in this novel technology from the nanocapsule platform is to ensure the
site-directed modification of antibodies by PMPC polymer without masking the epitope recognition capability and
Fc-dependent antibody functions, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or Fc-receptor binding. We
here applied this new platform to antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) to improve their anti-cancer efficacy and
overcome the known issues surrounding ADCs in clinical use. The site-specific PMPC engineering of ADCs
allowed for heightening of the drug-antibody ratio (DAR) by two-fold compared to the parental ADC, Kadcyla (T-
DM1), one of the HER2 directing ADCs approved by the FDA in 2013 to treat breast cancers. Moreover, this
technology enabled exerting superior anti-cancer activity against various cancerous cells in comparison to
Kadcyla, while providing the CNS-deliverable feature. Importantly, PMPC-engineering of Kadcyla with high DAR
successfully induced anti-cancer immune responses without changes in adverse toxicity. Under this proposal,
we will confirm the effectiveness of the site-directed PMPC-engineering of ADCs against other antigens
selectively expressed on human cancer cells derived from different disease backgrounds. We will also test their
efficacies in patient-derived xenograft mouse models. At the end, we will develop a novel ADC by further
engineering the PMPC polymer structure to overcome therapy-resistant issues of ADC. These studies are
intended to develop highly reliable, clinically relevant, and sufficiently safe ADCs."

Accurate dose delivery at the tumor site is crucial for the success of radiotherapy (RT) for cancer treatment.
However, as yet there are no techniques in clinics with the ability to monitor RT. This project proposes X-ray-
induced acoustic (XA) computed tomography (XACT) to facilitate dose monitoring during RT. Pulsed X-ray
radiation, when absorbed by tissues, leads to thermoelastic expansion which generates acoustic waves. These
waves can be sensed by ultrasonic transducers around the irradiated tissue and fed to an XACT algorithm to
reconstruct the X-ray energy deposition (XED) maps. As an expert in computational biomedical imaging, Dr.
Pandey’s current challenge is to develop efficient XACT algorithms to enable real-time/near real-time
quantitative monitoring of the XED: the focus of the proposed project. Existing RT setups in clinics only need to
integrate a transducer array to adopt XACT-based radiation dosimetry without significantly affecting existing
RT practices. Dr. Pandey is key personnel in the ongoing projects funded by the NIH/NCI (R37 CA240806) and
the American Cancer Society (133697-RSG-19-110-01-CCE); Dr. Liangzhong Xiang is the Principal
Investigator. These projects aim to achieve in vivo dosimetry using XACT. Although XACT has seen
substantial utilization in dosimetry research, certain challenges hinder its clinical translation. The first one being
suboptimal signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) in XA signals and the main focus of Dr. Xiang’s R37 research is
towards developing advanced instrumentation to resolve this. Dr. Pandey’s research as well as this R50
proposal addresses the algorithmic challenges which include the limited view artifacts, absence of quantitative
dose information, and lack of the capability of correcting for acoustic heterogeneity in the reconstructed dose
maps. The key objectives of this proposal are coherent with the aims of the ongoing NCI and ACS projects.
Protons, owing to their unique energy deposition characteristics, are an attractive choice for RT. Much like X-
rays, clinical pulsed proton beams are also known to produce acoustic waves and Dr. Xiang’s group’s recent
preliminary studies (with Dr. Pandey’s contribution) have shown the capability of dose monitoring during proton
therapy which led to the NIH/NCI U01 Award (U01CA288351). Since XA and proton-induced acoustic waves
share the underlying physics, Dr. Pandey’s algorithms from the R50 award will also benefit the U01 grant. Dr.
Pandey’s doctoral and postdoctoral training in developing advanced model-based (MB) algorithms for acoustic
tomographic modalities and experience with XACT qualify him to achieve the proposed aims. MB
reconstructions are computationally intensive and hence, graphics processing units-based acceleration will be
implemented for achieving real-time/near real-time dose monitoring. The R50 award will provide protected time
for Dr. Pandey to express his research creativity to grow into a seasoned research scientist and help achieve
the goals of the proposed R37 & U01 projects which will push for the clinical translation of XACT and
protoacoustics for radiation dosimetry."
10982445,"Background: The toll of suicide goes way beyond the death of an individual. Those exposed (defined as knowing
the person) to a suicide death are at elevated risk for mental illness, physical disorders, impaired social
functioning, and fatal and nonfatal suicide behavior. Conclusions from the handful of studies that have examined
this topic among Veterans are limited by distinct samples, limited sample sizes and other methodological issues.
Additionally, the numbers of women and minority race/ethnicity service members and Veterans in these studies
were too small to examine what are likely critical differences by sex and race.
Significance: This study will provide foundational information on an understudied risk factor for suicide in a
cohort of Veterans at increased suicide risk – post 9/11 Veterans within six years following military separation. It
will provide information to inform suicide postvention strategies that target the population of suicide bereaved
post-9/11 Veterans as well as those targeting women and American Indian/Alaskan Native (AI/AN) Veterans.
Innovation and Impact: (1) Use of VA data to provide the most reliable prevalence estimates for suicide
exposure among Veterans to date; (2) Oversampling of vulnerable but understudied populations -- Women and
AI/AN Veterans; (3) inclusion of two comparison groups to elucidate the common and unique contribution of
suicide exposure to health outcomes and patterns of VA service utilization; and (4) Assessment of the formal
and informal supports Veterans receive for mental health problems associated with suicide using both survey
and VA healthcare utilization data.
Specific Aims: (1) Evaluate differences in the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), prolonged
grief disorder (PGD), and in suicidal ideation, attempts and planning among Veterans exposed to suicide
compared with those exposed to other causes of sudden death and with unexposed Veterans. We will also
evaluate differences by sex and race. (2) Identify modifiable moderating factors for the association between
suicide exposure and negative outcomes and modifiable moderating factors for the association between suicide
or sudden death exposure and negative outcomes relative to those with neither exposure. (3) Describe treatment
experiences, interests, reported suicide attempts, and patterns of VA service utilization among those exposed to
a suicide death compared to Veterans exposed to other sudden deaths and to unexposed Veterans. (4)
Contextualize quantitative findings through interviews with a purposive sample of Veterans exposed to suicide.
The interviews will focus on modifiable factors at each level of the socio-ecological model of suicide prevention
to better understand targets for intervention.
Methodology: This explanatory sequential mixed methods study examines outcomes associated with suicide
exposure in a nationally representative sample of post-9/11 Veterans enrolled in VA healthcare. We will collect
data in three waves. Wave 1 will implement a national population probability sample using a brief survey to
assess exposure history (suicide, other sudden death, neither) and exposure characteristics (e.g., time since
exposure) among 11,400 Veteran respondents. Wave 2 will survey Wave 1 respondents, stratified by exposure
history (suicide, sudden death, neither), to assess outcomes and variables of interest among 4,500 Veterans
(1,500 respondents per exposure group). Wave 3 involves interviews with a purposive subsample of 32 Waves
2 survey responders who have been exposed to suicide but differ in outcomes. Quantitative analysis is the
priority of the study; the qualitative component will contextualize the quantitative findings.
Next Steps/ Implementation: This work will direct VA and the field towards an understanding of the most critical
outcomes among veterans exposed to suicide, the mechanisms that may lead to deleterious outcomes, and lay
a foundation for understanding the effective treatments and supports needed for Veterans who experience a
suicide loss, including women and AI/AN Veterans."
10982590,"Greenhouse gas emissions and anthropogenic air pollution are changing the climate, creating complex spatial
and temporal interactions that threaten health on a global scale. The existing literature has addressed the main
effects of extreme temperature or air pollution on human health primarily with spatially coarse exposure
estimates and without considering their interactions. The result is that environmental epidemiology on the
health impacts of extreme heat and air pollution for aging populations is often out of date and likely
underestimates these effects, in an era when our climate is increasingly unstable. Recent advances in satellite
remote sensing and machine learning to predict ground conditions present a key opportunity to enable
comprehensive study of the multifaceted effects of climate on healthy aging. Leveraging this opportunity, the
CHAIRS-C Research Project will combine advanced spatiotemporal exposure modeling with national Medicare
data, already in use at Brown, for case-crossover epidemiologic analyses. Our team combines expertise in
environmental epidemiology, pharmacoepidemiology, big data health services research, and advanced
biostatistical modeling. The long-term objectives of this project are to improve the quantification of the health
impacts (emergency department visits and hospitalizations as well as all-cause mortality) associated with
short-term extreme temperature, specific humidity, and fine particulate (PM2.5) air pollution on aging
populations; identify vulnerable subpopulations; and construct a framework for the comparison of medications
that increase the occurrence of climate-related illnesses. These results will help improve targeted public health
interventions and may lead to actionable medication adjustments that modify the adverse effects of climate-
related exposures. To achieve these objectives, the project will pursue the following specific aims: 1)
Estimating the climate-related health impacts for older adults by linking new best-available temperature,
specific humidity, and PM2.5 exposure estimates with Medicare records for aging populations, using a case-
crossover design; 2) Quantifying the sensitivity to climate-related exposures within susceptible subpopulations
to prioritize public health interventions with a particular focus on social determinants of health that contribute to
climate-related health disparities; and 3) Examining comparative effect modification attributable to target
medication classes on heat-related events, using propensity-score matching for medication selection within a
case-crossover analytic framework for health effects. This 3-year research project is nested within the
collaborative infrastructure of CHAIRS-C and will establish a platform for further solutions-oriented
interdisciplinary research and community engagement. Constructing national place-based linked datasets for
temperature, humidity, and PM2.5, as well as social determinants of health, demographic covariates, chronic
conditions, pharmaceutical prescriptions, and the quantification of impacts on hospitalization and death in the
Medicare population will further accelerate innovative research in climate change and healthy aging for all."
10982592,"The Capacity Building Core (CBC) of CHAIRS-C will prepare Brown researchers to engage in innovative

is to design and institutionalize transdisciplinary collaborative research and community engagement trainings
guided by the practice principles of equity and actionability and to launch multiple research projects and
scholars focused on climate impacts on the health of older adults. To achieve these long-term objectives, the
CBC will pursue the following specific aims: 1) Catalyzing new research in climate, aging, and health by
implementing a Pilot Projects Program and providing early stage and new NIH investigators with support for
research proposal development, submission, and execution; 2) Developing research capabilities in climate,
aging, and health research through a progressive sequence of activities, beginning with a Climate Change,
Aging, and Health Unconference of faculty and postdocs to identify research gaps and generate
Transdisciplinary Collaborative Teams focused on addressing those gaps, and a set of Accelerating Science
Workshops to train researchers in collaborative team science skills, community engagement, use of climate

capacity for research and action in climate, aging, and health by growing the Brown climate and health
curriculum at all degree levels; fostering career opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral
researchers; and training older adults to prepare for and communicate climate risks. The CBC will coordinate
all capacity building activities with the Administrative Core, Research Project, and Community Engagement

10999155,"As the tobacco product landscape continues to shift, there has been a dramatic increase in poly-tobacco use,
particularly the dual use of combustible and electronic (e-)cigarettes. The health implications of dual use are
unclear, as are the treatment and policy decisions as to how to best manage it. On one hand, dual use has the
potential to decrease both individual and population harm, insofar that toxicant exposure is lowered and eventual
cessation of combustible cigarettes becomes possible, as growing evidence suggests. However, harm reduction
is maximized only when dual users transition completely away from combustible cigarette smoking, and when
that transition is sustained. Indeed, the potential benefits of e-cigarettes are unrealized if dual users fail to quit
smoking. Thus, dual use has the potential to reduce or perpetuate harm. The critical difference between these
two outcomes is how these harm reducing/promoting tobacco products are used interchangeably; i.e., patterns
and trajectories over time. Unfortunately, the natural course of dual use, particularly in comparison to exclusive
smoking or vaping, is unclear. Cohort studies of dual use, often derived as secondary analyses from national
surveillance projects with yearly assessments, suggest that, for some, dual use can be either transient or
prolonged. Almost all of these studies lack detail on anything beyond use status (using vs. not), and particularly
lack detail on daily patterns of use over time. A focused and more granular assessment of dual use patterns is
needed to understand who these individuals really are, and how their smoking and vaping behaviors do and do
not change over time. Within a nationally based cohort study of dual users (n=396), and exclusive users of both
combustible (n=198) and e-cigarettes (n=198), natural use histories will be assessed through a combination of
a) detailed daily diaries over 3 months, b) serial bursts of nightly diaries that coincide with c) episodic monthly
surveys over a 1-year follow-up, and d) biological verification of combustible cigarette smoking. Study aims are
to 1) describe, and 2) compare the consistency of use behaviors over time, within and across cohorts. As a third
aim, using a within-subjects approach, we aim to assess the defining day-to-day patterns of dual use that best
predict subsequent abstinence from combustible cigarette smoking. The proposed project is the largest and
longest study of dual users (vs. exclusive users) ever conducted with a priori design considerations to more fully
understand the complex interplay between these two products, one of which is the root cause of significant
cancer incidence and mortality, and the other is a controversial harm reduction option with fast growing
population appeal. Building upon a successful program of cancer prevention research using naturalistic research
designs, remote methods, and team science, the proposed study expands our foundational knowledge regarding
tobacco use behavior and cessation among and across different groups of tobacco product users. Ultimately,
and regardless of outcome, our results will inform clinical and regulatory decision making of novel products that
may enable or impede the proliferation and marketing of the fastest growing segment of the tobacco marketplace."
10998612,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lentiviral vectors (LVVs) are an effective gene therapy agent due to their ability to integrate into host DNA,
providing stable expression of transgenes. LVVs have been under clinical development as a gene delivery
system to treat diseases, including blood cancers, through the generation of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-
cells. The first two CAR T-cell therapies were approved for clinical use in the treatment of lymphoma or acute
lymphoblastic leukemia in 2017, and since then four more CAR T-cell therapies have been approved by the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical use. Despite the success of these agents, on November 28, 2023, it
was announced that all clinically approved CAR T-cell therapies were under FDA investigation due to the
emergence of cellular transformation in patients receiving LVV-derived CAR T-cells, leading to cancers, and
resulting in hospitalization or death. While much work has been done to define LVV integration profiles, such as
the identification of preferential integration into intronic genomic elements, it is still thought to be a mostly random
process. For example, LVV integration has been seen in promoters, transcription start sites, exons, and
untranslated regions, resulting in differential gene expression and alternative splicing patterns when compared
to untransduced controls. Standard methods for characterizing integration profiles, such as ligation-mediated
PCR (LM-PCR) remain constrained by short read lengths and only identify the integration sites but provide no
information regarding the proviral integrity. Short-read sequencing is limiting in situations of integration into low
complexity or repeat-rich genomic areas that cannot be efficiently mapped with these data. Additionally, LM-
PCR and other common methods require priming from long-terminal repeat regions; however, integrated
lentiviral genomes contain large deletions including, in some cases, missing LTRs that would not be captured by
current methods and may result in incomplete transgene expression from that event. To address this unmet
need, we developed a novel method, single-molecule, real-time capture (SMRTcap) that leverages long reads
to resolve integrated lentiviral genomes. We hypothesize that current methods for resolving LVV integration are
incomplete, thereby limiting our ability to comprehensively characterize LVV integration sites, proviral integrity,
and their impact on host cell biology. Using SMRTcap we will resolve LVV integrations in experimentally-
generated, primary CAR T-cells, providing a complete view of integration sites, clonal expansion, and presence
of intact transgenes. Using single-cell (sc-) isoform sequencing (IsoSeq) and sc-RNA seq on these same CAR
T-cells, we will evaluate the influence of LVV integration on host gene expression, splicing, and isoform usage.
These data will provide a comprehensive view of LVV integration into primary T cells and the impact of this event
on the host genome and host cell biology. These new insights are expected to contribute to vector safety profiling
and provide critical understanding regarding LVV-related transformations in LVV-treated individuals."
10999052,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Ozone is a common ambient air pollutant that presents a significant public health hazard as a trigger for lung
function decrements, airway inflammation, and exacerbations of asthma and COPD symptoms. Controlled
human exposure studies have found that the severity of these responses varies widely across individuals while
the severity of a given individual’s reaction is reproducible across multiple independent exposures, indicating a
potential genetic contribution to one’s risk for a severe response. Results from animal models also indicate that
response to ozone is a complex trait. The genetic variants that underly this variation are currently unknown and
this data gap needs to be addressed to identify high-risk individuals. Mapping expression quantitative trait loci
(eQTL), which are statistical associations between variants and gene expression, is one approach used by
human geneticists to study the genetic basis of complex traits. However, most eQTL mapping studies have used
unperturbed/unexposed samples which may miss eQTL that only manifest after exposure or have an altered
magnitude of effect with exposure, termed “response eQTL.” These response eQTL are thus gene-by-
environment interactions. Studying these interactions in humans is often difficult, making in vitro models an
attractive approach. Primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) isolated from the airway are a highly
relevant in vitro model. HBECs can be readily cultured into a well-differentiated pseudo-stratified epithelium
similar to that found in vivo and are cultured at an air-liquid interface, enabling in vitro exposures which mimic in
vivo exposures. Additionally, using primary cells from different donors provides the genetic variation necessary
for mapping eQTL. The goal of my project is to use this in vitro model to identify ozone response eQTL, genome-
wide, and identify overlapping signals with asthma and COPD GWAS loci. I hypothesize that mapping ozone
response eQTL in a physiologically relevant cell culture model will identify variants associated with response
variability. Further, I hypothesize that some of these response eQTL will colocalize with GWAS signals for asthma
and COPD, which have both been shown to be affected by air pollution exposure. In Aim 1, I will characterize
the transcriptomic response to ozone in HBECs from 202 donors with diversity in age, sex, genetic ancestry, and
smoking history. In Aim 2, I will map baseline and ozone response eQTL, using the difference in gene expression
between filtered air and ozone exposed culture pairs from each donor to map response eQTL. In Aim 3 I will
perform colocalization between ozone response eQTL and GWAS for asthma and COPD, followed by Mendelian
randomization analysis to evaluate a signal’s effect on disease via gene expression. In total, I will identify genetic
drivers of increased risk for severe response to ozone using a response eQTL strategy to find context-dependent
eQTL, which will improve identification of susceptible individuals and inform policy regarding safe levels of
exposure."
10997585,"Project Abstract
 Diseases of the gastrointestinal system are complex and, as a result, poorly understood on a genetic and
molecular level. Understanding how certain factors establish and maintain the homeostatic balance of
proliferative stem cells and differentiated, functional villus cells in the intestine is important to uncovering why
these diseases arise. Recently, the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathway has been implicated in driving
a gradient of functional cell types for intestinal villus enterocytes, the absorptive cells in the intestine. Improper
differentiation of these enterocytes can lead to metabolic dysfunction, malabsorption, and compromised barrier
integrity. Additionally, stem cells in the crypts are suppressed by BMP signaling. Loss of stem cell suppression
can lead to uncontrolled proliferation and cancer. Despite the demonstrated importance of BMP signaling in
maintaining appropriate differentiation and suppressing unwanted proliferation, the specific molecular
mechanisms by which this tissue patterning occurs are not understood. Mothers against decapentaplegic
homolog (SMAD) family proteins are transcription factors involved in the canonical transduction of signaling
cascades for the BMP pathway to regulate and promote development of most tissues in the body. SMAD1 and
SMAD5, the BMP pathway-specific receptor-regulated SMADs (R-SMADs), have not yet been extensively
studied in the mammalian intestine with regards to transcriptional mechanisms or genetic requirements.
I hypothesize that SMAD1 and SMAD5 control key aspects of intestinal cell functionality and stem cell
suppression downstream of BMP signaling. I will evaluate intestinal function after epithelium-specific knockout
of Smad1 and Smad5. Specifically, I will determine the role of SMAD1 and SMAD5 in metabolism and tissue
patterning of the intestine by performing RNA-seq, histology, and organoid assays on murine intestinal tissues
(Aim 1). To define the targets of these transcription factors more accurately and identify interacting partners, I
will perform molecular profiling of SMAD1 and SMAD5 using CUT&RUN and RIME (Aim 2). My project will clarify
the roles of SMAD1 and SMAD5 in the establishment and maintenance of intestinal cell functionality and
homeostasis and may reveal opportunities to target BMP pathway components in intestinal dysfunction.
Importantly, this project will provide critical training opportunities in the application of mouse models, organoid
technologies, epigenomic profiling techniques, and bioinformatic data analysis toward understanding and
manipulating signaling pathways. As well as strengthening my research skillset through the proposal goals, I will
improve my scientific presentation, writing, and collaboration skills. The proposed research project, training plan,
and mentorship team will support my development into an independent research scientist poised to employ
mouse models and organoid technologies toward my research career in regenerative medicine and development
of cell therapies."

human disease, commensals, symbionts, and phages while prioritizing the training of a diverse
scientific workforce. A core objective of the MGBP Meeting is to provide an engaging and
supportive forum for trainees and junior faculty to share their work in a collegial, inclusive
environment. The 2023 attendees (516) hailed from 30 US states and >10 countries and included
undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, faculty members and professional
scientists from the private sector. Several innovative aspects distinguish the MGBP meeting
including: (1) the Diversity Showcase to highlight scientists from historically marginalized groups,
(2) mentoring tables for discussion of career paths, inclusivity, and diversity, (3) the Sternberg
Thesis Award for the most outstanding Ph.D. thesis, (4) trainee poster awards, and (5) community
building events. The 2024 MGBP Meeting will be held from August 5-9 at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison, an ASM-designated “Milestones in Microbiology Site”. Aligned with the
tradition of past MGBP Meetings, ~70% of the oral presentations will be from postdoctoral
scholars and graduate students, chosen from submitted abstracts based on scientific merit and
diversity of their backgrounds. The remaining 30% of the presentations will be from faculty,
including the keynote and session chairs, and junior faculty chosen from the submitted abstracts.
Among the 9 invited talks for the 2024 meeting, 5 are female and 3 are scientists from historically
marginalized people in STEM; 55% are Assistant or Associate Professors. The keynote speaker
for the 2024 meeting will be Dr. George O’Toole, a long-standing member of the MGBP
Community who is an active advocate for promoting equity in science. Dr. O’Toole will present
his pioneering research on biofilms produced by the opportunistic human pathogen
Pseudomonas. To promote diversity and inclusion, we propose to select 13 meritorious trainees
from the submitted abstracts for registration waivers and provide childcare/ family care funding
grants for trainees and faculty. Together, the rigor and inclusivity of the scientific program, the
focus on increasing diversity and inclusion of trainees, and the opportunities for collegial

11000018,"Ventricular tachycardia can be a life-threatening arrhythmia that requires effective and timely treatment. This
treatment often takes the form of catheter based ablation; however, the success rates are modest. Moreover,
the ablation procedure is invasive, done under general anesthesia, and can take many hours in patients who
already have compromised cardiac function, putting them at risk for more complications. Recently, radiation
therapy, like that used in oncology has been used to ablate cardiac arrhythmias. Initially performed in patients
who had run out of other options, the success in a few patients has opened the possibility of wider use.
However, despite this promising success, the biophysics of how radiation affects the cardiac tissue, the
timeline of scar formation, the acute and more chronic effect on the electrical propagation and the dose
response are all unknown. The time to response in radiation ablation in the reported studies is also highly
variable, ranging from immediate to more than 6 weeks for any results. More importantly, although radiation
ablation is non-invasive, it often requires an invasive electrophysiology study to identify the target site(s), an
essential step that determines the success or failure of the procedure. We propose to address both these
limitations by using our proven expertise in the fields of imaging, electrophysiology, computational modeling,
and radiation oncology to advance the use of radiation as a noninvasive means of ablation with the following
aims: (1) Determine the dose response and structural and functional effects of radiation on the cardiac tissue;
(2) Create radiation targeting strategies using personalized computational models of ventricular arrhythmias in
a pre-clinical VT model and patients; (3) Carry out non-invasive radiation ablation treatment in a pre-clinical
infarct model with ventricular tachycardia. In aim 1 we will address the biophysics of ablation by performing
electrophysiology studies at different time points after ablation with different doses to understand the effects of
radiation on electrical propagation. We will be doing serial MRIs to create a dose response and to evaluate the
heart for structural remodeling like edema, fibrosis, and scar. To provide a physiological basis for the effects,
we will do histology, protein expression analysis and confocal microscopy. In aim 2 we will use MRI to assess
patients with pre-existing ventricular scar and make personalized simulation models to determine the VT circuit
and the critical part of the circuit to target with radiation. Our existing database of VT patients, with MR images
and ECGs with VT and detailed map of the VT will provide the opportunity for validation of these models along
with a pre-clinical VT model. Finally, in aim 3 we will treat suitable VT pre-clinical model with radiation instead
of the traditional radiofrequency to further understand the mechanism underlying ablation with radiation.
Improving our understanding of the effects of radiation treatment for cardiac arrhythmias will fundamentally
change the way that patients with VT are managed, shortening procedure times, and reducing the risks
associated with invasive traditional ablation."

There is a critical need for more effective and durable prostate cancer treatments. Prostate cancer (PCa) is the
most frequently diagnosed cancer among men and the second leading cause of male cancer deaths in the US.
The development, progression, and recurrence of PCa is dependent on the Androgen Receptor (AR). This has
led to the use of anti-androgen therapies that reduce endogenous steroid hormone production as well as the use
of AR antagonists. Unfortunately, nearly all patients receiving this androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) develop
resistance and progress to castration resistant PCa (CRPC). The prognosis for CRPC is poor, with median
survival of ~3 years with the best medical therapy. In short, CRPC has poor treatment options and prognosis
thereafter, presenting a clear and significant need for new treatments. Ligand activated transcription factors
(TFs) aside, TFs have traditionally been viewed as “undruggable”, although this paradigm is rapidly shifting. The
targeting of TFs for drug development has tremendous potential based on their well-documented roles in cancer
stemness, immune evasion, autoregulatory driver circuits, and drug resistance. The transcription factor ERG is
the predominant target of chromosomal translocations with TMPRSS2; these gene fusions are observed in ~50%
of prostate cancer patients. As the expression of TMPRSS2 is AR regulated this gene fusion results in AR driven
over-expression of ERG in these prostate cancers. Multiple model systems have confirmed the driver nature of
ERG in prostate cancer, firmly establishing ERG as a validated therapeutic target for PCa. To that end, we are
proposing to further develop along the translational pipeline novel small molecule inhibitors of the transcription
factor ERG as a new approach for the treatment of PCa. We are proposing two Aims for this grant. Aim 1.
Optimization of small molecule inhibitors of ERG. We developed inhibitors of ERG-DNA binding with high
nanomolar to µM cellular efficacy and specificity via hetero-bivalent inhibitors that combine a fragment that
stabilizes autoinhibition of ERG with a fragment that covalently reacts with ERG. In Aim 1, we will further optimize
these inhibitors for potency and specificity. They will be evaluated for potency and selectivity within the Ets family
using biochemical assays and for cellular specificity using mass spec based chemoproteomics approaches. Aim
2. Preclinical evaluation of ERG inhibitors. We will profile effects of the inhibitors on prostate cancer cell lines
(proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, migration). Effects on gene expression and ERG occupancy of well-validated
target genes will be evaluated in addition to genome wide profiling of gene expression and ERG occupancy in
the genome in response to ERG inhibition. Inhibitors will be tested using an ex vivo prostate cancer patient tissue
model and patient derived xenografts."

Mosquito- and tick-borne neurotropic arboviruses cause annual epidemics of virus-induced encephalitis
throughout the world and are considered some of the most rapidly spreading vector-borne diseases. West Nile
virus (WNV) is the leading cause of mosquito-borne encephalitis in humans in the United States and there are
currently no antiviral therapeutics or vaccines to control or prevent infection\disease. The major focus of this
proposal is to develop and use innovative single cell techniques to gain unprecedented insight into WNV infection
of the lymphatics and spleen. This will allow us to better define the cellular targets of infection and understand
how the antiviral response limits virus replication and spread at a single cell level. The pathogenesis of WNV in
humans is incompletely defined, although excellent immunocompetent mouse models have illuminated
mechanisms of virus-induced encephalitis and features of immune control. Following delivery into the skin, WNV
replicates in keratinocytes and innate cells within the myeloid lineage, including dendritic cells (DCs) and
macrophages. We have found that WNV quickly spreads from the nearest draining lymph node to other
peripheral and CNS-draining lymph nodes (deep cervical and superficial) as well as the spleen. Eventually, this
leads to a viremic phase followed by viral entry to the CNS and infection of neurons in the brain. We and others
have determined that virus control early during infection, especially within the peripheral lymph nodes and spleen
is essential for limiting virus dissemination into the central nervous system. The RIG-I like receptor and type I
interferon (IFN) signaling pathway are critical for promoting antiviral immune responses that serve to control virus
replication, dissemination to the CNS and infection outcome. High-throughput genomic technologies have been
an invaluable tool for studying the host response to WNV infection over the past several years. While these
technologies have revealed novel pathways and innate immune networks that control viral replication, a key
limitation to these genomic studies is that they rely on measurements from bulk cell populations which does not
account for heterogeneity in the cellular response to a virus infection. Single cell analysis can reveal rare cell
types, distinguish between infected and uninfected bystander cells, and identify unique subpopulations important
for the host response to virus infection. Our proposed study utilizes a multidisciplinary approach that combines
virology, immunology, molecular biology, and systems biology to developing single cell methodologies, identify
in vivo cellular targets of infection, and evaluate the host response to WNV infection within infected and bystander
cells. In Aim 1, we will develop a WNV-inclusive single cell RNA sequencing method to identify and profile WNV
infected and bystander cells. In Aim 2, we will identify the cellular targets of infection and molecular pathways
that restrict WNV infection in the lymphatics. Understanding early events that take place after WNV infection at
the single cell resolution may help guide development of targeted therapeutics and vaccines."

The mechanosensory Merkel cells (MCs) are crucial for encoding the sense of light touch. Recent studies have
shown that MCs also significantly regulate alloknesis, the itch sensation caused by light mechanical stimulation.
Notably, alloknesis is commonly observed in the elderly, with research indicating a decrease in MC numbers in
aged human and mouse skin. Among many skin abnormalities occurring with aging, dry skin condition appears
to be involved in alloknesis. In experiments using a mouse model of experimental dry skin induced by acetone-
ether-water (AEW) treatment, a decline in MC numbers and an increase in alloknesis were observed.
Interestingly, upon discontinuing the AEW treatment, MC numbers returned to normal, and the mechanical itch
was gradually alleviated. This suggests that uncovering the cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling MC
decrease or MC regeneration could pave the way to designing therapies to prevent alloknesis in aging and dry
skin. In Aim 1, we will focus on understanding the mechanisms behind the regeneration of MCs. Pilot studies
showed that MC recovery is not due to MC proliferation; however, the exact source of MC regeneration remains
unknown. We demonstrated that the Tenascin C (TNC)-expressing epidermal keratinocytes are MC progenitors.
Here, we will use lineage tracing and single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate if TNC-positive cells are
responsible for MC regeneration upon AEW treatment and to identify cellular and molecular processes controlling
MC regeneration. We will then perform genetic studies to examine the functional significance of identified
processes on MC regeneration. Finally, we will analyze molecular changes in MC progenitors and the MC
differentiation program in young vs old mice and uncover the functional significance of the identified changes on
the age-related decline of MCs. In Aim 2, we will investigate the interaction between MRGPRA3/TRPV1+ itch-
initiating C fibers and MCs, as our studies showed that the ablation of MRGPRA3/TRPV1+ neurons prevents MC
reduction upon AEW treatment. Here, we will perform chemogenetic manipulations of the activity of
MRGPRA3+/TRPV1+ sensory neurons to reveal the causal relationship between sensory neuron activities and
MC numbers. We will further identify molecules secreted by MRGPRA3/TRPV1+ neurons post-AEW treatment
and receptors of these molecules in MCs or MC progenitors, shedding light on the cellular and molecular
dynamics controlling MC numbers. We will test the functional significance of the identified ligand-receptor pairs
for controlling MC numbers and inducing alloknesis by performing functional genetic studies in the settings of
aging and dry skin. Overall, these studies aim to offer new insights into preventing age-related MC decline and
associated alloknesis, potentially leading to novel therapeutic interventions."

Protein phosphatases play a key role in cellular signaling pathways, opposing kinase activity to
dynamically balance protein phosphorylation. Despite their critical role in cell signaling, they
remain understudied as compared to protein kinases. We are submitting an application requesting
support for the 2024 edition of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology
(FASEB) Science Research Conference on Protein Phosphatases. For over 34 years, this
conference has explored the roles of protein phosphatases in normal physiology and pathological
conditions. Recent research has expanded our understanding of the functions and regulation of
the more than 1000 forms of these complex enzymes, identifying them as integral to cellular
homeostasis. As such, roles of specific phosphatases, and their associated newly identified
mutations found to be causal to a variety of human diseases, continue to be elucidated, as basic,
translational, and clinical researchers across academia and industry work to decipher the
complexities of phospho-regulated pathways and to identify novel therapeutic targets. This
Protein Phosphatase conference is an effective and focused forum that helps to educate
newcomers and disseminate and integrate recent advances in this rapidly growing and changing
field. Highlighting its critical role in the scientific community, this conference will be the 17th edition
of a recurring series of bi-annual FASEB meetings, held continuously since 1990, and continues
to be the sole meeting in North America on this topic. We are planning the 2024 conference to
continue the merger (second time) between two of the longest-standing world protein
phosphatase conferences: the FASEB protein phosphatase conference and the Japanese
Association for Protein Phosphatase Research (JAPPR) conference. The Specific Aims of the
2024 FASEB-JAPPR Conference on Protein Phosphatases are 1) to present and discuss the
most current work on the structure, regulation, and function of protein phosphatases; 2) to
highlight major achievements and new approaches to fuel the interest of industrial and academic
groups in drugging phosphatases; and 3) to refresh and renew the field through the engagement
and development of early career investigators (ECIs) and underrepresented individuals (URIs)
including women. This application requests limited financial support, particularly for invitations of
ECIs and URIs to attend and contribute to this joint conference held in Palm Springs, California
in December 2024."

People with HIV/AIDS (PWH) are twice as likely to smoke cigarettes compared with the general population. Further,
PWH are less likely to quit smoking, likely due to barriers including co-occurring behavioral risk factors, stigma, limited
resources, experiences of racism and discrimination, and diminished access to health care. Importantly, cigarette
smoking is a significant risk factor for both HIV-related and non-HIV-related morbidity and mortality among PWH.
Health disparities observed among smokers with HIV are compounded by the tendency for PWH to have lower
incomes, lower education attainment, and lower access to healthcare. Suboptimal rates of smoking cessation and HIV
disease management among Black PWH who smoke appear to be related to increased exposure to interoceptive-
stress symptoms (e.g., anxiety, bodily sensations, stress-related burden due to racism or HIV diagnosis discrimination
or stigma). Consequently, smoking cessation interventions and HIV disease management directed toward Black
PWH who smoke might benefit from a specific focus on decreasing emotional reactivity to interoceptive stress.
Anxiety sensitivity (AS) is a candidate mechanism pertaining to the expectancy that interoceptive sensations are
personally dangerous, which escalates emotional reactivity. Yet, only one study has leveraged the potential of AS to
better understand smoking, HIV disease management outcomes, and interoceptive stress relations among Black
PWH who smoke. Our group, along with collaborating colleagues, has developed smoking cessation interventions for
PWH that engage AS to increase smoking cessation success. Early work included in person smoking cessation
interventions. Our more recent efforts have focused on developing and testing an integrated, culturally appropriate,
mHealth intervention for smoking cessation, AS reduction, and HIV disease management improvement for Black
PWH who smoke (MASP+). MASP+ targets multiple health conditions that interfere with successful aging: smoking,
mental health, and HIV disease management. To date, MASP+ has only been available to patients receiving HIV care
within a single, urban community clinic. This proposal aims to test MASP+ in a national sample of participants with
treated and untreated HIV. First, we propose to review already developed MASP+ materials with 30 members from
our priority population to ensure their appropriateness and therapeutic fit. Next, we will recruit and enroll 300 Black
PWH who smoke to participate in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Participants will be randomly assigned to: (1)
MASP+; (2) the National Cancer Institute (NCI) QuitGuide smartphone app for standard mobile smoking cessation
treatment; or (3) an assessment only control. Participants will complete a baseline assessment, daily ecological
momentary assessments, and follow-up assessments at weeks 1, 2 (quit date for MASP+ and QuitGuide), 3, 4, 5, 6
(week 6 includes a qualitative interview for a subset of participants), 28, and 54 via our InsightTM app. All participants
will have the option to receive nicotine replacement therapy. If the efficacy of MASP+ is established, it would serve as
a low-burden and highly accessible treatment option for smoking cessation, improved mental health, and improved
HIV care adherence/engagement, which all serve to support successful aging and improved well-being."

Along with nucleic acids and proteins, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are considered a foundational building block
of biology. However, unlike their more widely-studied counterparts, the tools for analyzing GAGs are relatively
lacking. In our prior R01, we developed solid-state (SS-) nanopore technology for GAG analysis, focusing on
the key molecule hyaluronan (or hyaluronic acid, HA) and establishing a method for determining molecular
weight (MW) distribution from a small sample amenable to physiological levels. This has allowed new
investigations into the size-function relationship of HA. The focus of this project will be to increase the value of
the SS-nanopore platform both in terms of HA measurement and as a general GAG analytical tool. In the first
Aim, we will first implement a strategy for HA quantification that can be coupled with our existing MW
assessment to render a more versatile technology. HA abundance is an independent identified biomarker in
several disease states, making it valuable in combination with size distribution. Then, we will establish a
microfluidic infrastructure to enable HA extraction from biological matrices and subsequent SS-nanopore
analysis to be performed in a self-contained format, improving the accessibility of the approach to other
laboratories. In the second Aim, we will first develop improved reagents to support targeted extraction of HA
that has been coupled to protein markers of inflammation (heavy chains), with the goal of selecting for different
protein isoforms that are thought to have independent functions. Finally, we will extend the SS-nanopore
analytical approach to other GAGs, focusing on the important molecules heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate
and integrating methods for assessing sulfation levels. Overall, this project will result in a more powerful
technology that will further the field of glycobiology."

Glucose transporter 1 deficiency (G1D) constitutes an increasingly recognized cause of epilepsy, intellectual
disability and motor control dysfunction. This summit proposal will catalyze the conjunction of several important
but still disjointed developments in need of cross-fertilization. Rapid scientific, patient organization and
information dissemination advances have made, for the first time, research on G1D approachable from a
meaningful, patient-centered perspective. This means that harmonizing the collective voices of the scientific
and patient community represented by the Glut1 Deficiency Foundation can greatly propel further progress.
Although prevalence estimates are likely to change, about 1% of idiopathic generalized epilepsy or 1 in 23,000
births have been associated with G1D. Nevertheless, there is still no effective treatment. Yet, our recently
adopted Team Science perspective and work in numerous single laboratories elsewhere have been yielding
steady benefits. For example, we have contributed from the molecular characterization of mutation
pathogenicity to the isolation of a key neural circuit involved in epileptogenesis, including the first rigorous trial
of a dietary treatment, all under NIH sponsorship. Still, numerous additional approaches worldwide have also
proven as fruitful or promising. Therefore, we propose to join the patient community with many of the leading
investigators in the field in a summit. An example of the effectiveness of such collaborative work are our 2020
international diagnostic and treatment consensus recommendations, which already stand in need of revision
given how rapidly the field is advancing. We also aim to reach consensus, or at least lay the groundwork, on
the best animal models to share, the most informative biomarkers, the main disease phenotypes and their
evolution across the lifespan, and the most effective clinical trial and data sharing approaches, given the need
to unify concepts and disseminate resources. None of this can be accomplished by any single laboratory or
team working in isolation. Instead, our approach will be open, transparent and international. The summit will
benefit from 1) extensive previous expertise with scientific and patient centered G1D conferences and
additional multi-lingual online events organized according to rigorous metrics, 2) existing partnerships with
sister G1D patient organizations across the world, 3) the accessibility of the proposed location, which has been
home to the largest clinic focused on G1D, 4) the strong support of some of the leading researchers not only in
G1D but also in related fields such as dementia, cancer and epilepsy where metabolism is important, and 5)
robust diversity and event safety plans. We expect ample dissemination of the proceedings via several
mechanisms, thereby propelling a transformation of the G1D field for years to come, including the development
of a network of investigators informed by patient needs and the creation of a framework for future revisions."

11000639,"Project Summary
Approximately 33% of the nearly 700 workplace chemicals identified in the National Institute of Occupational
Safety and Health (NIOSH) Pocket Guide are associated with hepatotoxicity. Several of these have been linked
to increased liver disease mortality in workers in different occupational settings such as heavy construction
equipment operators, chimney sweepers, and chemical workers. Xenobiotic-induced hepatotoxicity is
characterized by oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis, which, in later stages, may result in hepatic failure
and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). While transcriptional perturbations have been implicated in inflammation
and fibrosis; the role of post-transcriptional regulation in the development of xenobiotic-induced hepatic
inflammation and fibrosis is unclear. The tristetraprolin (TTP) family of RNA binding proteins (RBPs)
including zinc finger protein 36 (ZFP36) commonly referred to as TTP, zinc finger protein 36 like 1 (ZFP36L1),
and zinc finger protein 36 like 2 (ZFP36L2), are the key players in post-transcriptional regulation of a large
number of inflammation-relevant mRNAs. These proteins bind to AU-rich elements (AREs) on the 3’untranslated
regions (3’UTRs) of target mRNAs and promote their decay. TTP family RBPs are dysregulated in human HCC.
Industrial chemicals including chlorpyrifos, tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4),
also dysregulate the expression of TTP family RBPs. However, the downstream molecular and cellular effects
of these dysregulations on the host remain unknown. In this proposal, we will test our novel hypothesis that
xenobiotic-induced dysregulation of TTP family RBPs expression results in altered post-transcriptional regulation
that determines the pathogenesis of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. We will use CCl4-induced liver
inflammation and fibrosis as a model of hepatotoxicity and test our hypothesis through three specific aims. In
Aim 1, we will employ liver-specific ablations of the three RBPs in mice and novel “omics” approaches to test the
pathogenic mechanisms by which these RBPs regulate xenobiotic-induced liver inflammation and fibrosis. Aim
2 will characterize the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which TTP family RBPs regulate epithelial-
mesenchymal transition, a lead cause of fibrosis and tumor metastasis, and finally, Aim 3 will test whether
increasing the expression of TTP family RBPs in the liver protects against xenobiotic-induced hepatic
inflammation and fibrosis. The overall goal of the proposed research is to understand the role of TTP family RBP
mediated post-transcriptional regulation in the pathogenesis of xenobiotic-induced hepatotoxicity. Successful
completion of the proposed studies will have a significant impact on the mechanistic understanding of the
pathophysiology of xenobiotic-induced liver disease and the potential identification of TTP family RBPs as
endogenous anti-inflammatory/anti-fibrotic proteins whose activity could be possibly enhanced to delay or
prevent the onset of liver failure."

Beginning early in life, metabolic dysregulation related to the triplication of chromosome 21(e.g. decreased
energy expenditure, increased leptin, hypotonia, increased inflammation, and autonomic dysfunction) as well
as lifestyle (e.g., poor diet, sedentary behavior, reduced and disrupted sleep, and stressors) are thought to
contribute to the 2 times greater prevalence of obesity in people with Down syndrome (DS) as compared to the
general population. In the general population, metabolic health, obesity, and lifestyle have strong associations
with health conditions including obstructive sleep apnea, Alzheimer’s disease, cardiometabolic diseases, and
cognitive impairments. However, the relationship between these factors in people with DS is not well
understood. The Metabolic Health, Lifestyle, and Risk of Co-Occurring Health Conditions in Down Syndrome
(MET-DS) study is a five-year, longitudinal study of factors that alter the risk and severity of co-occurring health
conditions in children, adolescents, and young adults with DS. The study involves a rigorous deep-phenotyping
protocol to better understand the complex interplay between trisomy 21, metabolic dysregulation, obesity,
lifestyle, and the development of co-occurring health conditions. This effort will enroll 200 participants (ages 6-
24 years of age) with DS from four clinical performance sites, and follow them annually across 3 data collection
cycles to address the follow aims: 1) Deeply characterize and establish normative data on metabolic health,
obesity, and lifestyle factors of a large cohort (N = 200) of children, adolescents, and young adults with DS
(aged 6-24 yrs.); 2) Measure the stability and change in profiles of metabolic health, weight status, and lifestyle
factors across 2 years (3 time points; 12 months apart) and during transitional periods of development; 3)
Establish the relation between metabolic health, obesity, and lifestyle factors on co-occurring health conditions
(e.g., obstructive sleep apnea, cardiometabolic diseases, autoimmune diseases, and early biomarkers of
Alzheimer’s disease) and cognitive development across 2 years (3 time points; 12 months apart); 4)
Collaborate with the other DS-CRS sites and the DS-4C on the development, implementation, and data
harmonization of common core measures across domains (e.g., clinical, cognitive, behavioral, imaging, and
multi-omics) and sites, and lead the DS-CRS sites in collection of metabolic and lifestyle measures."

Protein folding in the cell is critically dependent on the assistance of molecular chaperones. The ring-shaped
chaperonins are essential members of the cellular folding machinery. These large protein complexes consist of
two stacked seven- to nine-membered rings. Chaperonins bind unfolded substrates in their central cavity and
use binding and hydrolysis of ATP to mediate polypeptide folding. Substrate proteins are thought to fold upon
encapsulation in the central cavity formed by each ring. The long term goal of this program is to understand
how the chaperonin of eukaryotic cells, TRiC, mediates polypeptide folding., TRiC is hetero-oligomeric and
uses ATP cycling to open and close a built-in lid over the central chamber. Intriguingly, TRiC has the ability to
fold some eukaryotic proteins, such as actin, that cannot be folded by any other chaperone. Despite its essential
role in cellular folding, little is known about the mechanism and substrate binding properties of TRiC.
Our work in the previous funding period provided important mechanistic and structural insights into this
chaperonin. We established that the conformational cycle of TRiC is significantly different from that of
bacterial chaperonins and demonstrated subunit diversity confers dramatic functional asymmetry to this
seemingly symmetric chaperonin. Importantly, in the previous funding period we developed a recombinant
system to study this chaperonin that for the first time makes it possible to generating mutants that can be
studies functionally and structurally. These breakthroughs enable us to study how TRiC facilitates folding in
unprecedented detail, through the following proposed aims:
1. Characterize of the nucleotide cycle of the chaperonin TRiC: Chaperonins use ATPase cycling to
promote conformational changes leading to protein folding. We want to understand how the ATPase cycle of
TRiC is coordinated among the different TRiC subunits, and how ATP cycling drives conformational changes
in the chaperonin and how the ""built-in"" lid that opens and closes in response to ATP-binding and hydrolysis.
2. Define the molecular basis of TRiC-substrate interactions: Little is known about the molecular basis of
TRiC-substrate interactions. We want to define the substrate recognition code of the binding sites for the
different subunits in the chaperonin and define the motifs within substrates that are recognized by TRiC.
3. Investigate the mechanism of TRiC-assisted substrate folding: The exact role that chaperonins play with
respect to the substrate is still a mystery. We will explore the effect of TRiC on substrate proteins during the
different stages of the folding cycle by combining biochemical approaches together with crosslinking and
fluorescence spectroscopy.
Importantly, recent observations have highlighted the links between TRiC and several pathological states
incuding cancer, viral infection and neurodegeneration. Thus our project deciphering the mechanism of this
chaperonin in cellular folding will help develop therapies to ameliorate these human diseases."

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been shown to significantly decrease a variety of malignancy-related
mortality in the past two decades. However, concerns have been raised due to their potential vascular toxicity
that could lead to hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral arterial diseases. Despite these
safety concerns, the mechanisms underlying TKI-induced vascular toxicity (TKI-VT) are poorly understood. To
overcome this challenge, we propose to leverage human iPSCs, state-of-the-art multi-omics methods, and
CRISPR screening to investigate molecular and cellular mechanisms of TKI-VT and identify druggable targets
that can be further tested in animal models. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will comprehensively profile in vitro
phenotypes of TKI-VT using iPSC-derived cardiac pericytes (PCs), an important but rarely explored cardiac cell
type, in a 2D monolayer to define cellular mechanisms of TKI-VT. In Aim 2, we will evaluate how TKIs induce
disrupted cellular crosstalk between iPSC-PCs and iPSC-endothelial cells (iPSC-ECs) by performing integrative
omics on a vessel-on-chip model. We anticipate that the successful completion of these studies will lead to novel
mechanistic insights into TKI-VT pathogenesis and help develop promising therapeutic strategies that can
prevent and/or treat TKI-VT on cancer patients who require chronic TKI treatment or whose life expectancy can
be restored to normal after short-term treatment. Moreover, this proposal will help define the role of TKIs in
vascular pathophysiology, which may have broad scientific and clinical implications beyond cardio-oncology.
Proposed Supplement:
In the last decade alone, the Hispanic population in the United States has grown by 23% to 62.1 million
individuals, making it the fastest-growing minority ethnic group. Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) present a
significant health risk to Hispanics, with a higher risk than all other ethnic groups. This community faces unique
risk factors for CVDs, the nuances of which remain elusive largely due to underrepresentation in clinical trials
and gaps in understanding their specific cardiac health differences. To address this, this diversity supplement
will extend the scope of the parent R01 to further understand TKI-VT in Hispanic populations. In Aim 1, this
proposal will derive iPSC-ECs and iPSC-PCs from Hispanics and introduce TKIs to evaluate changes in cellular
functions, oxidative stress, and cell fate plasticity in monolayers. In Aim 2, the same iPSC-ECs and iPSC-PCs
will be used to construct 3D Vessel-on-Chip models to identify TKI-induced changes in vascular cell crosstalk
that may trigger vascular dysfunction. This supplement is an important opportunity to extend the understanding
of cardiovascular health differences in the Hispanic population."
11002782,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Prioritizing diversity in polygenic risk prediction of primary open-angle glaucoma
Glaucoma is the leading worldwide cause of irreversible blindness. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), the
most common type of glaucoma, is more prevalent and severe in individuals of African ancestry. Unfortunately,
individuals from this ancestral group have been under-represented in genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) thus far. Furthermore, polygenic risk scores (PRS) based on GWAS data from European-descent
populations are not transferable to individuals of diverse (non-European) ancestry. Given the aspirations of
precision medicine, PRS demonstrate clinical potential but fall short, in part, due to the lack of diversity in these
studies. We hypothesize that clinically-implementable PRS can be achieved by including African and African-
descent individuals in gene discovery and PRS development.
To inform and improve precision ocular health, we will prioritize diversity in polygenic risk prediction of POAG
with three proposed aims that will yield the largest-ever meta analyses of POAG in African and African-descent
individuals and the first-ever African-ancestry focused POAG PRS. In Aim 1, we will perform meta-analyses of
47,078 samples (18,037 cases, 29,041 controls) to identify novel POAG loci in African and African-descent
populations. Given that most GWAS have been performed in mainly European and European-descent
populations, we hypothesize that undiscovered POAG risk loci will be detected by leveraging the power of
meta-analysis of case-control GWAS in African and African-descent population samples. In Aim 2, we will
meta-analyze admixture mapping results for each of our datasets to identify African ancestry-specific POAG
loci. We hypothesize that admixture mapping will identify genomic regions where African ancestry co-
segregates with POAG risk. Significant loci from Aims 1 and 2 will be fine-mapped and evaluated for selection
signatures. In Aim 3, we will build and optimize POAG PRS in African and African-descent base dataset meta-
analyses. We will then evaluate novel and published PRS for POAG classification in test datasets. We
hypothesize that ancestrally-informed POAG PRS will better predict POAG and relevant clinical outcomes in
African and African-descent populations compared to those derived from primarily European-descent data.
Meta-analysis results from Aims 1 and 2 as well as variants from our optimized PRS in Aim 3 will undergo
pathway analyses to identify biological pathways and statistical driver genes implicated in POAG risk. In the
long-term, we hope that the information gained from this project will inform a broader understanding of POAG
genetics across diverse ancestry groups and provide the foundational basis for the clinical applicability of
ancestrally-informed PRS for POAG."

Title: Plasmodium vivax Erythrocyte Invasion Mechanisms and Humoral Immune
 Response in Duffy Negative Africans
Individuals of African ancestry were thought to be protected from Plasmodium vivax
because they lack Duffy antigen expression on the surface of their erythrocytes rendering
P. vivax unable to invade their red blood cells. However, an increasing number of P. vivax
cases reported across Africa and in Duffy-negative individuals challenges this
conventional dogma, raising the possibility that some P. vivax lineages have evolved to
use ligands other than Duffy Binding Protein for erythrocyte invasion. The intrinsic
invasion mechanism and immune response of Duffy-negative individuals to P. vivax are
largely unknown. In this application, we will investigate the expression and function
of erythrocyte binding genes in Duffy-negative P. vivax and the antibody response
of Duffy-negative individuals to P. vivax antigens. There are three specific aims: 1) to
identify genes with differential expression between Duffy-positive and Duffy-negative P.
vivax by RNA-seq; 2) to determine in vitro binding and invasion activities of P. vivax
candidate ligand proteins to Duffy-negative red blood cells; and 3) to examine in vivo
antibody levels to targeted P. vivax antigens associated with erythrocyte invasion in Duffy-
negative patients. The proposed research will be conducted in Ethiopia, where malaria is
a major public health problem and about 30% of the 1.2 million confirmed malaria cases
were P. vivax. As our study sites have a large number of P. vivax cases and a
significant proportion of Duffy-negative individuals, we have a unique opportunity
to study the invasion mechanisms of P. vivax in Africa. We have a collaborative team
and logistics in place for sample collection and processing. Our established lab culture
facility closes to the health centers and successful P. vivax transcriptome data obtained
from cultured schizonts have demonstrated the feasibility of this research. Comparison of
P. vivax transcriptomes between Duffy-negative and Duffy-positive individuals from both
in vitro and in vivo samples will provide the first description of genetic and functional
attributes of P. vivax that permit infection of Duffy-negative erythrocytes. This research
will significantly enhance the understanding of invasion mechanism of P. vivax in Duffy-
negative individuals and lay a foundation for molecular and biochemical characterizations
of P. vivax ligand-receptor interactions. Knowledge of P. vivax invasion mechanisms
and host immune responses will have important implications for P. vivax vaccine
development and vivax malaria risk assessment both within and outside Africa."

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common inherited genetic disorder with a variety of symptoms, most
commonly as neurocutaneous lesions and developmental disorders, and less commonly with tumors. Cognitive
symptoms such as attentional deficits affect up to 80% of patients, with diagnosis of attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) estimated at 50% in NF1 patients. Unlike the general population, attention
deficits affect boys and girls equally in NF1. Few studies have investigated the underlying mechanisms
contributing to high incidence of ADHD diagnosis in NF1. Using a murine experimental model system of NF1,
mice haploinsufficient for the NF1 gene (Nf1+/-), our preliminary data in male mice show deficits in behavioral
inhibition, a key component of ADHD, as exhibited by hyperactivity in open field, increased fall frequency in cliff
avoidance reaction task, and increased frequency of small reward choice in delay discounting task, rescuable
by ADHD medication (guanfacine 0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) administration. The first aim of this proposed study will
elucidate the brain mechanisms underlying deficits in behavioral inhibition, and will be powered to detect male
and female differences in behavior and corresponding measures of circuitry activity including in vivo recordings
in the prefrontal cortex. In the second aim, we propose a genetic rescue for these observed behavioral
inhibition deficits. NF1 is caused by reduced levels of neurofibromin, a RAS GTPase-activating protein,
resulting in RAS-MAPK-ERK hyperactivation. Currently, there are no available treatments for cognitive deficits
in NF1 that target RAS-MAPK-ERK hyperactivation. This project, proposes a novel mechanism for treatment of
cognitive deficits in NF1 by restoring neurofibromin levels through modulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome
pathway. Overall, this project will characterize clinically relevant circuits underlying behavioral inhibition
deficits, a key feature of ADHD, in males and females. Additionally, this proposal will address the need for a
treatment target in NF1 that has the potential to address the many symptoms patients may experience
including cognitive deficits, tumors, and neurocutaneous symptoms. Modulation of the neurofibromin ubiquitin-
proteasome pathway may provide a novel and safer pharmacologic target for treating NF1."
10979659,"Zinc is the most abundant trace metal in the body, and the highest zinc concentrations are found
in semen. Human semen is enriched with 1-3 mM zinc, a 100-fold higher concentration than the
zinc contents of other parts of the body. Moreover, low seminal zinc has been correlated with
male infertility. High concentrations of zinc are also found surrounding newly fertilized eggs.
Despite several observations documenting that sperm encounter high concentrations of zinc
multiple times between mating and fertilization, how zinc regulates sperm is unknown. The
overall objectives of this application are to uncover how zinc alters sperm swimming and
establish the mechanism by which zinc homeostasis changes between when sperm are first
mixed with the seminal fluids and when sperm arrive at the site and time of fertilization. The
central hypothesis is that zinc derived from the seminal fluid and released by the egg at
fertilization regulates sperm swimming and their ability to fertilize. The rationale for this project is
that uncovering a role for zinc in the processes that sperm undergo between mating and
fertilization will provide the conceptual foundation needed to develop strategies for fertility
treatments, and the development of non-hormonal contraception can be developed. The central
hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Establish the mechanisms by which
zinc regulates sperm at mating; 2) Delineate the mechanisms of zinc depletion during
capacitation; and 3) Define how zinc alters hyperactivation of mouse and human sperm. Under
the first aim, we will use proteomics, computer-assisted semen analysis, and biochemistry
approaches to define how zinc enters and regulates sperm at mating. For the second aim, we
will use fluorescence-based experiments to understand how intracellular zinc is depleted during
capacitation. For the third aim, we will use electrophysiology and computer-assisted semen
analysis to understand how zinc regulates the Ca2+ channel CatSper and the swimming pattern
known as hyperactivation. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it
focuses on zinc as a central regulator of sperm physiology, combines experimentation on both
mouse and human sperm, and uses mass spectrometry to identify plasma membrane-localized
proteins in sperm. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to change our
understanding of the essential events of fertilization. Ultimately, this knowledge has the potential
to offer new opportunities for the development of innovative fertility interventions."
10982360,"PROJECT SUMMARY
RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), including enzymes that act on RNA, impact all aspects of cellular
function. However, the roles, molecular mechanisms and integration with the cellular regulatory
networks are still unknown for most RBPs. The goal of this study is to elucidate the function,
molecular mechanism, and regulation of a novel endoribonuclease, EndoU. Uniquely, the
RNase activity of EndoU in vitro and in cell culture is directly activated by Ca2+ ions, suggesting
a role in the cellular responses to this key second messenger. Importantly, EndoU misregulation
is associated with uterine, cervical, skin, bronchial, and lung squamous cell cancers. It is heavily
downregulated in esophageal, oral squamous, and cervical cancer, and is a strong prognostic
marker in head/neck and colorectal cancers. EndoU is cytoplasmically expressed in distinct cell
types sharing a major, driving role of programmed cell death in their development: thymocytes,
B cells, squamous epithelial cells, and placental syncytiotrophoblasts. We hypothesize that
EndoU controls survival/differentiation decisions during thymocyte development by cleaving
target RNAs in response to changes in intracellular calcium levels. We specifically aim to fill the
knowledge gap in understanding EndoU’s cellular role, RNA targeting repertoire, and the
mechanism of EndoU activity and its Ca2+-dependent conformational control."
10983873,"The vision of the Louisville Clinical and Translational Research Center (LCTRC) is to build an impactful Clinical
and Translational (C&T) research program at the University of Louisville (UofL) to improve the health of Kentucky
(KY) communities. Kentucky is, by any measure, a poor and largely rural state with a single large metropolitan
center that suffers disproportionately from many chronic diseases. For example, KY is ranked first in the U.S. in
cancer and COPD incidence. To address these problems the UofL in its research strategic planning process
created Programs of Distinction in cardiovascular disease, neuroscience, cancer and metabolic disease. Thus,
UofL has been very deliberate about developing research programs to meet the state’s most pressing health
problems. However, UofL has approached C&T research of these health problems through underfunded and
admittedly uncoordinated efforts in clinical trials infrastructure, research design, research funding, and
mentorship. Also, until 2019, UofL C&T research was performed almost exclusively at two facilities. In 2019,
UofL created UofL Healthcare (ULH) that has 11 hospitals, a cancer center, and multiple outpatient centers. ULH
with its larger footprint and patient volume has challenged the capacity of our C&T infrastructure, but also created
a major opportunity to increase the amount and quality of our C&T research. The long-term goal of the LCTRC
is to build the needed workforce and expertise at UofL and our affiliated healthcare systems to conduct impactful
and community engaged C&T research. We will achieve this goal through these five Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1: Expand and fully integrate clinical and translational research at UofL, ULH and other
healthcare partners. (Administrative and Community Engagement and Outreach Cores).
Specific Aim 2: Create and implement professional development for early-career clinician investigators,
students and C&T research staff (Professional Development Core).
Specific Aim 3: Develop Pilot and Developmental projects to support community scientists, trainees,
early-career and established C&T investigators (Health Research Core).
Specific Aim 4: Establish a centralized resource that provides LCTRC investigators with essential
support in research design, data analysis, compliance, and data management (Research Design,
Compliance and Data Management Core).
Specific Aim 5: Invest in both community-led and community-participatory C&T research to improve
public health using multi-directional inputs sensitive to the culture and needs of underserved
populations. (Synergistic among all Cores). Successful implementation of the LCTRC will create a single
point of access program for C&T research that allows us to perform studies in urban and rural populations that
ultimately improve public health."

 Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most severe subtype across the spectrum collectively known as
cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD). Our researchers have previously identified a genome-wide significant
association at the locus Chr1q22 for ICH which replicated in an independent population. This finding was then
replicated in other CSVD phenotypes of white matter hyperintensity, microbleeds and total stroke with a particular
risk for small vessel ischemic stroke. The Genetic and Environmental Risk Factors for Hemorrhagic Stroke
(GERFHS) study then performed deep sequencing of the locus which found that rare and common variants
associated with ICH clustered in the promotor and enhancer regions of a gene labeled polyamine modulating
factor-1 (PMF1). PMF1 is a key transcription factor in the polyamine metabolism pathway. Polyamines are
ubiquitous and our major sources are dietary and from gut microbiota and are posited to have both beneficial
and toxic forms. Thus, our own data and literature support strongly implicates polyamine metabolism may be a
critical and novel risk factor for CSVD.
 We further obtained funding to measure polyamine and acrolein levels and found significant differences
between cases and controls as proof of technique and proof of concept data. We further identified a strong trend
of specific ratios of polyamines associated with neuoroimaging correlates of global tractography utilizing
advanced diffusion tensor imaging. Thus, the genomic convergence of common variant, rare variant, RNA gene
expression, protein and metabolomic data identifies polyamine metabolism as a potential novel risk factor for
CSVD and thereby vascular dementia, the second leading cause of Alzheimer’s Disease and Related
Dementias. Our investigators have developed a novel Micellar Electrokinetic Chromatography (MEKC) with
Colinear Laser Induced Fluorescence Detection (LIFD) method to accurately measure both acetylated and
unacetylated forms of each of the major polyamines.
 The current proposal seeks to recruit 400 controls from the NIA funded DECADE grant which will have
baseline MRI including DTI along with blood sampling and decades of cardiovascular risk factors in a biracial
cohort. The current proposal will measure polyamines and it’s toxic byproduct, acrolein in the baseline DECADE
sample as well as perform a 36 month-plus repeat MRI with DTI (GERFHS V) and obtain multiple blood samples,
extensive dietary history and cognitive evaluations to evaluate polyamine and acrolein levels and their correlation
with the development of future CSVD. If successful, we will be able to define high risk populations for future
intervention studies as well as target polyamine levels utilizing dietary and/or pharmacologic techniques in future
studies. The proposal extends a 20 year history to identify a novel genetic and environmental risk factor for
hemorrhagic stroke and it’s principal cause, CSVD.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most devastating brain neoplasm with high morbidity and mortality.
Despite multimodal treatment including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, the disease
recurs and is fatal. Given its public health importance, there is an unmet need for new treatment
strategies to prolong patient survival while improving the quality of life. SPAK (SPS1-related
proline/alanine-rich kinase) and OSR1 (oxidative stress-responsive kinase) are stress-sensing
kinases that phosphorylate and activate NKCC and KCC ion co-transporters which are key
players in restoring intracellular Cl- and cell volume in response to cell stress. This is of
importance because cell volume decrease and reduction of total intracellular ionic strength (via
Cl- and K+) are the earliest stimuli that lead to apoptosis. Cancer cells can counteract pro-
apoptotic signals by using regulatory volume increase through SPAK/OSR1/NKCC1 activation.
Therefore, these kinases can serve as a resistance mechanism to cell death. On the other hand,
cell volume regulation is an essential mechanism for cell migration in the confined spaces in the
brain. Our preliminary data using genetic and pharmacological inhibition of SPAK/OSR1 shows
that these kinases decrease GBM cell migration, proliferation and tumor growth in vivo and could
serve as a mechanism of therapy resistance to chemoradiotherapy. However, SPAK/OSR1
function, mechanism, and therapeutic role in GBM remains unexplored. We hypothesize that
SPAK/OSR1 exerts oncogenic functions as a cell-stress resistance mechanism allowing cancer
cells to survive hostile environments and enhance GBM malignancy. The goal of this proposal is
to evaluate if SPAK/OSR1 serves as a mechanism of resistance to the standard of care. We will
evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of SPAK/OSR1 inhibition using a novel small molecule inhibitor
in combination with chemo-radiotherapy and describe the role of SPAK/OSR1 in tumor resistance.
Our long-term goal is to set the foundation for a research program that will study the relevance of
the SPAK/OSR1 pathway in GBM progression identifying druggable signaling pathways that
regulate GBM cell invasion and proliferation."
10988576,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite advances in our understanding of rare genetic diseases and their causes, only 8% of these diseases
have targeted drugs. Much of this arises from the disconnect between the inhibitory nature of drug molecules
and a predominance of loss-of-function mechanisms in such diseases. There has been a growing appreciation
of the role of gain-of-function variants in this context, especially towards drug repurposing. More specifically,
we and others have shown that even subtle changes in function such as alterations of post-translational
modification or molecular interaction sites can frequently lead to such disorders. It is unclear to what extent
these observations generalize and are actionable from a therapeutic perspective. Common Fund data sets
such as those from the Gabriella Miller Kids First, Undiagnosed Disease Network, the Illuminating the
Druggable Genome and LINCS programs provide a unique opportunity to assess this computationally. Our
central hypothesis is that gain-of-function variants account for a much larger proportion of rare genetic
diseases than currently known and in silico functional profiling can be used to computationally identify such
diseases. The proposed work will test this hypothesis through two aims. In Aim 1, we will apply our previously-
developed predictors of variant impact towards the identification of known and predicted disease-associated
variants in large Common Fund genomic data sets. In Aim 2, we will subset out those variants that impact
druggable biochemical properties either directly or indirectly, to thus, infer novel drug-disease pairs. Over the
award period, the principal investigator (PI) will leverage his and his team's expertise in variant interpretation,
machine learning and bioinformatics knowledgebases towards the systematic integration of genomic and drug-
related data from multiple Common Fund data sets to identify candidate drugs that can be repurposed for rare
genetic diseases. This work will be carried out at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, home to world-
renowned researchers in human disease genetics, robust computational infrastructure, and a thriving
biomedical data science training environment. The proposed research will not only provide valuable pilot data
for experimental validation of promising drug repurposing candidates but will serve as the foundation for future
computational methodology development that will expand the scope of variants and mechanisms that can be
queried. The work is expected to have broad impact, as it presents a new mechanism-centric, data-driven
approach to identifying drug repurposing candidates for rare genetic diseases, that is generalizable to other
situations."
10988852,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Schizophrenia is characterized by discordant thought processes, perceptions, emotional responsiveness, and
social interactions impacting up to 0.7 % of the US population (National Institute of Mental Health, Health
Statistics). While rates of occurrence are low, schizophrenia ranks in the top fifteen leading causes of work
disability worldwide due to the severity of the symptoms. First episodes of schizophrenia typically occur in the
late adolescence to early adulthood. It is believed that interactions between genetic factors and aversive early
life experiences lead to abnormal brain development which produces the schizophrenia symptoms. While
widespread changes in the brains of schizophrenic patients have been documented, it is thought that the
cognitive disorganization relies on pathological processes within the hippocampus. As evidence, aberrant
network oscillations in the hippocampus in association with a selective spatial memory deficit are prominent in
schizophrenic patients. Within the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction model of
schizophrenia, GluN2B subnits have been implicated in changes in theta and slow gamma oscillations, cross
frequency couping, and impaired spatial memory. However, this situation is made more complex by the fact
that GluN2 subunits regulate ionotropic and direct intracellular signaling and these factors have not been
addressed fully with respect to the regulation of network oscillations and memory retrieval. We created
transgenic mice expressing chimeric GluN2 subunits in the forebrain to separate the ionotropic and direct
intracellular signaling processes downstream from NMDAR activation and discovered that heightened GluN2B-
type intracellular signaling enhances long-term spatial, but not non-spatial memory performance. Since slow
gamma oscillations in the hippocampus provide the functional network organization for spatial memory
retrieval, it is possible that GluN2B-type intracellular signaling regulates slow gamma oscillations to mediate its
effects on long-term spatial memory. We propose that inappropriate GluN2B-type CTD signaling is a critical
factor in the alterations in slow gamma oscillations and spatial memory in schizophrenia. We will test this idea
and extend the question to specific synapses by analyzing theta and slow gamma oscillations, cross frequency
coupling, and spatial memory performance in transgenic mice expressing chimeric GluN2 subunits in the
forebrain or limited to hippocampal principal cells or parvalbumin-positive interneurons. We predict that
heightened GluN2B-type CTD signaling at excitatory synapses onto principal cells or interneurons will
accentuate slow gamma function during planning of paths to know goal locations and improve spatial memory.
These findings would support GluN2B-type CTD signaling as a powerful factor in the regulation of hippocampal
network dynamics and spatial memory. Outcomes from this study will transform our understanding of the
neurobiological bases of schizophrenia and provide a novel framework for future research."
10988986,"Project Summary
 The central hypothesis of my F99-phase proposal is that the lack of T-cell infiltration into human tumors may
be caused by the presence of tumor-derived T-cell excluders (TCEs) in the TME, which are overexpressed in
tumor tissues and impair the function of T cells including their ability to migrate into tumor tissues. This provides
a potential explanation why both spontaneous and therapeutic T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity fail frequently
in patients with immunologically “cold” tumors. By employing a secretome-wide in vitro T-cell transwell migration
high-throughput screening (HTS) platform, we tested over a thousand soluble human proteins on the migration
of activated T cells towards chemokine signal. SLIT2 was identified as a candidate target and validated to directly
inhibit T-cell chemotaxis towards CXCL11, a common chemokine found in human tumor tissues.
 The N-terminal fragment of SLIT2 was first confirmed to mediate T-cell chemotaxis inhibition. Detailed
functional domain mapping demonstrated that the first two leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, where the
canonical receptor ROBO1 binds, are dispensable to SLIT2’s function in regulating T-cell chemotaxis. Meanwhile,
ROBO1 expression could not be detected on T-cell surface with FACS staining, and soluble ROBO1 extracellular
fragment fusion protein failed to neutralize SLIT2’s inhibitory effect on T cells, collectively suggesting a novel T-
cell specific SLIT2 signaling axis independent of ROBO1. In a syngeneic mouse pancreatic cancer model,
dramatically elevated T-cell infiltrated was observed in SLIT2 knock-out Pan02 tumors. SLIT2-KO tumors were
rejected by the immune-competent C57BL/6 mice, while the SLIT2 wild-type tumors grew. Such difference
diminished when the SLIT2-WT/KO tumors were inoculated into immune-compromised NSG mice. Anti-SLIT2
monoclonal antibody 11C8 neutralized the inhibitory effect of SLIT2 on T-cell chemotaxis in vitro, and its single-
agent treatment led to Pan02 tumor regression in vivo. The functional SLIT2 receptor expressed on T cells, the
broader impact of tumoral SLIT2 to the immune contexture within the TME, and the potential synergistic effect
of anti-SLIT2/anti-PD-1 combo are subject to further investigation during the F99 phase training.
 In the K00 phase of this proposal, I would like to expand my study to understand dysfunction of T cells during
tumor progression. These studies might include the discovery of additional TME-specific extracellular factors
that drive dysfunctional anti-tumor immunity in T-cell inflamed tumors. I propose to establish in vitro HTS
platforms to identify candidate targets that (1) promote central memory T-cell phenotype that favors egression
into secondary lymphoid organs, (2) reduce T-cell proliferative capacity and induce apoptotic signatures, (3)
suppress T-cell effector functions and drive exhaustion phenotype. Multi-omics studies and inducible expression
animal models will be utilized in parallel for target identification and validation purposes.
 Collectively, this proposed research will extend our understanding of tumor immune evasion mechanisms,
and lead to the discovery of novel immunotherapy strategies for cancer patients."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells depend on glutamine to meet their unique metabolic needs.
Glutamine fuels a wide array of biosynthetic pathways; however, despite these established dependencies, the
targeting of specific enzymes involved in glutamine utilization have yet to yield beneficial results. This proposal
is based on our preliminary data demonstrating that broadly targeting glutamine utilization via the substrate
analog 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) has a profound effect on PDAC tumor growth and metastasis. We
have discovered that the effects of DON on PDAC cell fitness are directly linked to asparagine (Asn) supply. This
observation is exciting because the ability of DON to exert its deleterious effects on tumors through blocking Asn
biosynthesis has never been examined. Metabolic targeting can trigger adaptive responses that allow tumor cells
to escape the effects of nutrient stress. We have found that PDAC cells robustly upregulate macropinocytosis
as a metabolic adaptation to DON treatment. In this way, the protein-derived amino acids produced by this uptake
pathway have the ability to dampen the effects of DON, suggesting that macropinocytosis inhibition might be a
beneficial strategy to sensitize PDAC tumors to DON. To gain mechanistic insight into DON-induced uptake, we
performed a high-throughput siRNA human kinome screen, identifying WNK lysine deficient protein kinase 4
(Wnk4) as a potent regulator of DON-stimulated macropinocytosis. Wnk4 plays an important role in ion transport
in the kidney, but has not been linked to macropinocytosis and its role in cancer has not been elucidated. In this
proposal, we will: (1) examine the role of macropinocytosis as a metabolic adaptation to DON in PDAC, and (2)
decipher the function of Wnk4 in macropinocytosis and PDAC tumor growth. This proposed project is significant
and innovative because it will establish the metabolic and molecular mechanisms underlying the functionality of
glutamine mimetics in PDAC and decipher the therapeutic framework for new combination strategies for PDAC."

The precise establishment of neuronal connectivity during development is critical for normal nervous system
function. This research examines how growth cones, which are the pathfinding structures of the developing
neuron, connect with their appropriate targets. External cues regulate neuronal connectivity formation by
resulting in the activation of intracellular signaling pathways and ultimately, reorganization of the cytoskeleton
and adhesions. This proposal focuses on understanding the molecular mechanisms linking extracellular
signaling with intra-axonal local translation in the developing nervous system. Local translation in axonal
growth cones is necessary for axon growth and guidance, however our understanding of how local translation
functionally directs axon guidance is limited. We recently demonstrated that point contacts, adhesion sites
within growth cones, are a strategic location for targeted local translation. Point contact adhesions directly
regulate axon guidance by linking the extracellular matrix to the intracellular actin cytoskeleton and providing
the force for growth cone movement. Thus, this finding is important because it suggests that local translation of
certain mRNAs at adhesions are situated to have a maximal impact on axon guidance. Point contacts are likely
a fundamental puzzle piece that has been missing from our understanding of how local translation functionally
directs axon guidance. Accordingly, our hypothesis is that local translation of β-actin mRNA is necessary
for point contact dynamics, and point contacts are localized organizing nodes for translational
regulation. We will test this hypothesis by determining if locally translated β-actin is integrated into point
contacts to direct axon guidance (Aim 1) and elucidating the signaling pathway through which extracellular
matrix-induced signaling stimulates intra-axonal mRNA translation (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will resolve the
suite of mRNAs that are locally translated in response to extracellular matrix proteins, and their relationship to
point contacts (Aim 3). Completion of the proposed aims will break new ground by discovering the interactions
between the extracellular matrix, point contacts and local translation in the regulation of axon guidance. This
research will enable a broad, mechanistic understanding as to how mRNA trafficking and local translation
contributes to the establishment of neuronal connectivity, and increase our knowledge about the complex
nature of brain development."

The lymphatic vasculature plays a critical role in fluid homeostasis, removing cellular waste and immune
responses. Recent research has highlighted its integral contribution during the regenerative response after
cardiac injury. The central nervous system was until recently, believed to be immune privileged and lacking a
lymphatic system. Recent studies have revealed the lymphatic system extends into the mammalian and
zebrafish brain, however the role it plays in neurogenesis and the response to injury is unknown. The need to
better understand how to alleviate the detrimental responses to Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and stroke and
promote regeneration is imperative in order to improve outcomes. This proposal aims to uncover the role of the
meningeal lymphatic system in adult neurogenesis and regeneration and the mechanisms through which it
contributes to generating new neurons during homeostasis and injury response.
 Previously, we have characterized the development of the zebrafish cardiac lymphatic system and
identified the signaling pathways that regulate its specification and formation. We then demonstrated that the
cardiac lymphatic vasculature expands post injury in the adult zebrafish heart. This work demonstrated that
lymphatic vessels respond to injury and aid the regenerative response by trafficking immune cells. By blocking
lymphangiogenesis we demonstrated that the lymphatic vasculature was required to promote regeneration and
prevent scarring of heart tissue. The discovery of the meningeal lymphatics led us to hypothesize that
meningeal lymphatics support adult neurogenesis and regenerative repair after injury by providing
neurotropic factors, controlling cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) composition and the immune response.
 To test this hypothesis, we will pursue two aims in the zebrafish as a model of adult neurogenesis and
brain regeneration. Aim 1 will characterize the lymphatic response to injury using time lapse imaging and
determine how disruption of the lymphatic system impacts adult neurogenesis. Using mass spectrometry, we
will analyze the composition of the CSF to identify lymphangiocrine factors that support neurogenesis. In Aim 2
we will manipulate the development of the meningeal lymphatic vasculature and use transcriptomic analyses to
determine the impact on immune cell populations and response.
 Pursuit of these hypotheses will open new avenues for investigation of lymphatic support of neurogenesis
in mammalian systems in health and after injury. In order to further our comprehension of adult neurogenesis,
the regenerative response of the nervous system and potential therapies forward it is critical to understand the
how the lymphatic system modulates the immune and environmental aspects of neurogenesis and regeneration."

Synapses are fundamental units of communication in the nervous system, where immense
diversity in structure and function serve to tune and calibrate information transfer. Defects in the
ability of synapses to properly diversify contribute to the etiology of a variety of
neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative diseases. One means of generating
diversity in synaptic function is through molecular heterogeneity, where combinations of distinct
genes are expressed at individual synapses to enable specific functional properties. However, it
has become increasingly clear, though difficult to resolve, that remarkable synaptic diversity can
be achieved from a limited set of molecular machinery. In principle, the Drosophila neuromuscular
junction (NMJ) is a uniquely powerful model to address how synaptic diversity is generated given
the sophisticated genetic, electrophysiological, and imaging approaches. In this system, two
distinct motor neurons converge to co-innervate individual muscle targets, where transmission
from a strong and weak input together drive muscle contraction in the motor circuit. However, an
inability to selectively isolate transmission from either input has been a major limitation towards
understanding synaptic diversity in this system. Here, we propose to use expression of a unique
Botulinum NeuroToxin (BoNT) to selectively silence transmission at strong or weak synaptic
inputs. Preliminary data suggests that while each neuron is largely composed of the same
molecular machinery at active zones, one core component, previously thought to function
universally at all active zones, actually subserves dramatically different roles at strong vs weak
synapses. We will use BoNT silencing, super resolution imaging, and the latest calcium reporters
targeted to release sites to illuminate differences in active zone nanostructure and function
between strong and weak synapses. We will also leverage new innovations in CRISPR
mutagenesis to dissect the specialized functions of eight core active zone components at strong
vs weak synapses. Finally, we will interrogate how these core active zone components are
uniquely targeted for modulation and remodeling at strong vs weak synapses in the context of
homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Together, these approaches will unlock fundamental insights into
how glutamatergic synaptic diversity is established and adaptively modified through plasticity.
Ultimately, this understanding will illuminate key mechanisms through which heterogeneous
functional properties at glutamatergic release sites are enabled by a limited molecular toolkit."

Our PCA research center brings together the UCLA Neurosurgery team with the Caltech spatial single cell team
to construct a comparative spatial atlas of low-grade gliomas. The collaboration between the three components
of the PCA research center has already generated preliminary data in several glioma samples. We will expand
this effort to generate a comparative atlas of gliomas with distinct progression outcomes using integrated spatial
transcriptomics, proteomics, and chromosome profiling. By comparing the low-grade gliomas that eventually
transform with ones that stay indolent or do not recur, and with IDH-mutant high-grade gliomas, we aim to
understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms at the low-grade stage that are predictive of malignant
transformation (MT) and to suggest intervention strategies to prevent MT. The comparative analysis will examine
three types of changes in low-grade gliomas with different outcomes: cell type composition, tumor
microenvironment, and pathway specific gene expression. From UCLA’s Brain Tumor Translation Resource
(BTTR) center, we have already collected 99 fresh-frozen low-grade glioma samples and will collect
approximately an additional 100 samples of low-grade glioma with different outcomes (MT, indolent, and no-
recurrence). 38% of the current cohort of patients are from under-represented minority groups; we will continue
to recruit from a diverse patient pool in order to better understand which patients may be at higher risk for
malignant transformation and therefore need more frequent surveillance or earlier intervention. We will then
generate an integrated multi-modal spatial atlas targeting 2500 mRNAs, 10 proteins and 10 DNA CNVs and
translocations. From the high sensitivity and multiplexed RNA seqFISH assays, we will be able to capture not
only cell type and microenvironment information, but also genes and pathways that could be causal for
progression to malignancy. Lastly, we will use the data to 1) predict tumor progression based on the cell type
compositions and microenvironments; 2) design intervention strategies based on the spatial data, using
counterfactual inference models to affect immune infiltrating and other predictors of progression; and 3) build a
model of tumor progression dynamics based on gene expression and mechanics of the tissue. Our
comprehensive low-grade glioma tissue collection, the integrated spatial dataset with transcriptomics,
proteomics and chromosomal abnormalities, and the models built using advanced machine-learning tools will
extend the existing capabilities of the HTAN consortium and be interoperable. The atlas and the computational
tools will be used by us and the wider scientific community to further understand the mechanisms leading to
malignant transformation."

The majority of solid tumors in children have a unique origin compared to those in adults, stemming from their
rise from embryonic cells. Despite this distinction, there is still limited understanding of the differences in the
microenvironments of these pediatric tumors compared to adult cancers, and how these differences might
contribute to lineage plasticity and treatment resistance. To address this knowledge gap, we propose a
comprehensive investigation into the spatial biology of these tumors. Our goal is to shed light on the specific
cells and mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment that play a role in inducing therapy resistance in
pediatric solid tumors. This research will focus on prominent pediatric cancers such as rhabdomyosarcoma,
neuroblastoma, and Wilms tumors. The primary goal of this multi-disciplinary Program is to establish a
comprehensive Pediatric Solid Tumor Microenvironment (PSTME) Atlas that would lead to discovering basic
mechanisms of de novo and acquired resistance to modern therapies, and uncovering tumor microenvironment
(TME) targetable vulnerabilities driven by resistance. The motivation for creating the PSTME atlas is the urgent
need to improve survival of patients with high-risk subtypes of the proposed cancers, and to decrease treatment-
related morbidities. By delving into the intricacies of the tumor microenvironment and its impact on treatment
response, we aim to advance our understanding of pediatric solid tumors and pave the way for more effective
therapeutic strategies. The Project will be supported by collaboration among two institutions with distinct and
unique resources and technologies, and complementary expertise: A) Children’s Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA)
group will provide well annotated tumor specimens with clinical information in an ethnically diverse patient
population, and lead in generating spatial proteomics data using pediatric and TME specific antibody panels. B)
California Institute of Technology (Caltech) group will provide innovative spatial omics technologies including
spatial transcriptomics and copy number, and novel data science approaches for integrative analysis of the
generated data. The samples will be selected to represent solid tumor diversity based on established clinical risk
stratifications, and critical points of transition (post chemotherapy response, relapse) to ensure capture of the
diversity of PSTME. The PSTME atlas will impact the community through generation of easily accessible TME
atlas providing a user friendly, searchable database of multiomics spatial analyses of common extracranial solid
tumors with clinical and outcome data. It will also provide novel computational pipelines for integration and
analysis of spatial data. These opensource tools will be made available to the community. In summary, the
significance of the proposed project is the establishment of an atlas that will allow discovery of fundamental
mechanisms of extrinsic cancer therapy resistance with the goal of leading to substantively improved probability
of cure coupled with reduced therapy-related morbidity for children afflicted with solid tumors."

African Americans are three to four times more likely to develop kidney failure than other populations.
Coding variants in Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1), termed G1 and G2, drive nondiabetic kidney disease risk in this

occurs in a recessive fashion, heterozygous risk variant carriers can develop kidney disease, and not all
individuals carrying the risk variants develop disease, highlighting our incomplete understanding of the APOL1
genetic susceptibility to kidney disease in African Americans.
 The Pollak Lab identified a 101kb duplication encompassing APOL1 and postulated that APOL1 copy
number variations (CNVs) contribute to the phenotypic heterogeneity of APOL1-associated kidney diseases.
Inheriting additional alleles of APOL1 increases the risk of kidney disease. More recent data suggest there
have been additional duplication events, and the structure and consequences of the CNVs remain unexplored.
APOL1 CNVs harboring various non-risk or risk variant copies illustrates an additional complexity to APOL1-
mediated disease susceptibility. We hypothesize there are APOL1 CNVs with duplicated risk variant
combinations that mediate disease risk through increased risk allele expression, thereby driving cell death.
 This proposal will explore the importance of CNVs for kidney disease by: 1) developing a computational
approach to characterize the risk variant architecture of APOL1 CNVs (how many non-risk and risk variants
present in an APOL1 CNV carrier) and identify risk variant combinations in patients with nondiabetic kidney
diseases, and 2) determining the in vitro functional consequences of harboring APOL1 CNVs through
investigations of allelic dosage mechanisms and cell death upon interferon treatment. Preliminary examination
of whole genome sequencing data from 1000Genomes APOL1 CNV carriers shows that utilizing CNV region
and allelic read depths will facilitate duplicated risk variant determination. This proposed work will advance our
knowledge of the APOL1 genetic susceptibility to nondiabetic kidney diseases and aid in kidney disease risk
assessment for individuals carrying APOL1 risk alleles and CNVs.
 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), a Harvard Medical School affiliated institution,
provides an exceptional learning environment for conducting this proposed research. Fellowship training will
include obtaining computational skills for studying structural variations, genomic allelic discrimination of the
APOL1 risk variants in CNVs, transcriptomic analyses for analyzing allelic dosage, and wet-lab techniques for
functional investigation of APOL1 CNVs. Mentorship from investigators at BIDMC who are leaders in APOL1
genetics and nondiabetic kidney diseases, in addition to collaborations from members at the Broad Institute,
will create a foundation for achieving academic career goals of becoming a principal investigator."

TITLE: Signaling mechanisms of the cerebral cavernous malformations protein complex
ABSTRACT
Loss of function mutations in the genes encoding KRIT1 (CCM1), CCM2 (OSM), or CCM3 (PDCD10) cause
Cerebral Cavernous Malformations (CCM). The presentation of this disease includes dilated leaky blood vessels,
especially in the neurovasculature, resulting in stroke, focal neurological defects, seizures and vascular
abnormalities. Each of the multi-domain CCM proteins functions as a molecular scaffold and importantly, CCM2
recruits the MAP kinase kinase kinase, MEKK3, to the multi-protein CCM signaling complex. Recruitment of
MEKK3 to the CCM complex is thought to result in suppression of MEKK3 activation of the MEK5-ERK5 pathway
and a reduction in KLF2/4 levels. In CCM disease this suppression is lost. Despite extensive research on CCM
proteins and their intersection with MEKK3 major gaps in understanding remain, including 1) the fundamental
organization of the CCM complex and how this impacts its activity, and 2) the mechanisms by which the CCM
complex controls the MEKK3 MAP kinase signaling cascade. In this highly-collaborative, multi-PI proposal the
Boggon and Calderwood laboratories will address these outstanding important gaps in knowledge. We will do
this in two Aims. In Aim 1, building on extensive preliminary data, we propose a revision of canonical models of
the CCM complex and will assess CCM complex stoichiometry as a determinant of signal transduction. In Aim
2, we will discover how CCM proteins act as determinants of MEKK3 signaling outcomes. Our structure-directed
functional studies will reveal the normal formation of and define the basis for targeted CCM complex modulation
of MEKK3-MEK5-ERK5 signaling."

The first breath of air for an infant is a crucial and complex event that requires coordination of many
physiological systems; however, the neural circuitry and molecular signals that help mediate the initiation of
respiration in this critical time remains unclear. In adults, regulation of breathing occurs through careful
coordination of multiple brainstem nuclei which make up the respiratory central pattern generator. Among these
brainstem nuclei is the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), a group of central respiratory chemoreceptors located
along the ventral lateral medulla. These glutamatergic neurons increase their firing rate in response to elevated
levels of arterial CO2 (PCO2), which in turn can drive respiratory output to re-establish and maintain PCO2
homeostasis via input to other brainstem nuclei within the respiratory network. All RTN neurons express the
transcription factor Phox2b, and neuropeptides Neuromedin B (Nmb), and pituitary-adenylate cyclase
activating peptide (PACAP). These neurons intrinsically respond to changes in CO2/H+ through two proton
sensors: TASK-2, and GPR4. GWAS analysis has revealed PACAP variants have been associated with higher
incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and PACAP-KO mice have been observed to have a SIDS-
like phenotype. Recent work from our laboratory demonstrated a striking upregulation of PACAP expression in
the RTN at the time of birth. Further we have shown that neonatal mice (p2-p12) lacking PACAP have
significantly more apneas when exposed to thermal stress, and a blunted respiratory response to hypercapnia
compared to their control littermates. These findings unveil a novel role for this peptidergic circuit in protecting
respiratory rhythm in neonates. It is currently unknown if PACAP is necessary for the initial establishment or
protection of a stable respiratory rhythm in the critical period immediately following birth, and further how this
dynamic expression of PACAP is regulated in the first moments of life. I hypothesize that PACAP expression
in the RTN is mediated through changes in blood gas homeostasis immediately following birth and is
necessary for establishing and protecting respiratory stability in neonates. In Specific Aim 1, I use
conditional PACAP knockout mice and whole-body plethysmography to test whether PACAP is necessary for
protection of stable respiratory rhythmogenesis in the face of thermal stress, and/or for establishment of normal
CO2 stimulated breathing over the course of the first hours of life. In Specific Aim 2, I investigate the
mechanism by which PACAP expression is stimulated at the time of birth by manipulating the principal RTN
chemosensitive feedback in opposing ways, or by genetically eliminating the putative CO2 sensors of the RTN,
while assessing PACAP expression through multiplex in situ hybridization or single cell-qPCR. The proposed
studies will provide novel information regarding molecular mechanisms which regulate the gene expression of
PACAP in the RTN, as well as the neural signals that are important for protecting neonatal respiration during
this vulnerable developmental period."
10997468,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neuropsychiatric disorders often cause lifelong disruptions of patients’ lives and lack satisfactory
pharmacological interventions. Symptoms in these disorders are likely associated with disruption in synapses
resulting from dysfunctional synaptic adhesion molecules (SAM), but the mechanisms by which SAMs may
contribute to synaptic dysfunction have not been fully elucidated. Complement C1q like 3 (C1QL3), is a promising
SAM for potential therapeutics for neuropsychiatric disorders because it selectively regulates excitatory
synapses and may therefore constitute a target for correction of the excitatory/inhibitory synaptic imbalances
associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders. To contribute to the future development of novel
therapeutics, I will elucidate the molecular mechanisms contributing to C1QL3’s roles in regulating excitatory
synapses. My preliminary data suggest that C1QL3 associates with the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor B3
and neuronal pentraxin 1 at synapses in mouse primary neuron cultures, consistent with our previous data
suggesting that these proteins promote cell-cell adhesion in heterologous cells in a C1QL3-dependent manner.
In Aim 1, I will test whether this hypothesized trans-synaptic adhesion complex truly forms at synapses in neuron
cultures, using super resolution microscopy. I will characterize the synaptic nano-architecture of this complex,
then determine the extent to which it is dependent on C1QL3 by knocking out C1QL3. I will further elucidate the
molecular interactions contributing to trans-synaptic adhesion through structure-function analysis using C1QL3
mutants that are not conducive to complex formation. This will elucidate the specific binding interactions that
contribute to C1QL3’s role in promoting synapse architecture and maintenance. In Aim 2, I will study how a novel
C1QL3 binding protein contributes to synaptic maintenance, potentially through its interactions with C1QL3. My
preliminary data suggest this novel protein increases excitatory synapse density in a C1QL3-dependent manner.
I will therefore determine this novel protein’s mechanism of synaptic regulation and the extent to which it
modulates the hypothesized C1QL3-mediated trans-synaptic adhesion complex. This study will provide insight
into the components of the molecular web of SAMs that regulate synapses and may highlight novel targets for
repairing synaptic dysfunction. Through this project I will develop and hone many skills that are essential for my
goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist at an academic institution. I am well supported in the
M.D./Ph.D. program at UConn Health by my sponsors and clinical mentors that will facilitate the successful
completion of this project and development into a promising physician-scientist."
10997817,"PROJECT SUMMARY
HIV-1 must assemble and disassemble into different morphologies throughout its life cycle to infect new cells
and replicate. Some examples of this include assembly and budding of the immature virion, maturation of the
viral core, and uncoating. Inhibiting or otherwise disrupting these transitions, which are critical for viral infectivity,
is an effective strategy in the design of antiretroviral therapies. For example, a class of drugs known as allosteric
integrase inhibitors disrupts maturation by preventing packaging of viral RNA in the mature core resulting in a
loss of infectivity. A full understanding of the process by which viral RNA is packaged would greatly aid in a
mechanistic understanding of how these drugs work. This mechanistic understanding would also aid in the
design of future therapeutics targeting RNA packaging just as would for drugs targeting budding and uncoating.
In this work, I propose to computationally investigate these three morphological transitions in HIV, focusing on
the role of factors beyond the capsid domain proteins including RNA, host cell factors, and potential therapeutics.
After expression by an infected cell, Gag polyproteins assemble at the plasma membrane into the 100nm, quasi-
spherical immature virion that buds outward from the plasma membrane. The formation and budding of the virion
were thought to be driven by interactions of the Gag CA domain, however, recent experiments paint a more
complex picture. I will investigate the role of membrane and membrane bending IBAR protein IRSp53 in budding
and assembly of the immature virion. I will incorporate IRSp53 into a coarse-grained (CG) model, which could
not previously generate the curvature necessary for budding to occur. The maturation of the virion begins when
HIV-1 protease cleaves the Gag polyprotein, freeing its different domains such as the capsid (CA) domain. CA
then assembles into the mature, conical capsid which packages the ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) composed
of viral RNA, Integrase (IN), and nucleocapsid (NC) protein among other components. Using CG models of
different resolution, I will investigate how the polymer-like RNP affects assembly of the mature focusing on the
physical properties necessary for encapsulation of the RNP. The final CG model will be built based off
experimental data showing contacts between RNA, NC, and IN with and without IN. Following import of the
mature capsid into the nucleus, the mature capsid uncoats and releases the viral DNA for integration. Uncoating
occurs as a result of reverse transcriptase transcribing viral RNA into more rigid DNA. This creates on outward
pressure on the capsid which leads to makes it unstable. I will investigate the pathway of uncoating using a UCG
model of reverse transcription that changes the rigidity of the RNP and a bottom-up CG model of the mature
capsid. This model will include host factors such as cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 6 (CPSF6)
as well as potentially therapeutic molecules that rigidify the capsid, possibly inhibiting the rupture of the capsid
and release of DNA."

Potassium (K+) channels are major determinants of cell excitability and play crucial roles in physiological
processes. Large conductance and Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channels, have the ability to couple intracellular
Ca2+ to membrane potential variations, play major physiological roles in vascular smooth muscle tone
maintenance, regulation of circadian rhythms, hearing, neurotransmitter release. BK channels can associate
with tissue-specific accessory subunits, endowing the channels with different functional properties. b2 and b3
subunits induce N-type (or ball-and-chain) inactivation of the otherwise non-inactivating BK channels. BK
channel dysfunction has been associated with many pathophysiological conditions, so understanding how they
gate can have major therapeutic consequences. In the previous grant cycle, we determined the structural
correlates of gating and ball-and-chain inactivation in K+ channels, using a prokaryotic homolog of BK
channels, MthK, from Methanotropicum thermoautotrophicum. We also found that lipid bilayer thickness
strongly affects MthK inactivation. Unlike BK, MthK channels inactivate using an intrinsic N-terminal “ball”
domain, similar to Shaker K+ channels. The overall objective of this grant is to determine the structural
correlates of ball-and-chain inactivation in BK channels and understand how lipids modulate inactivation in
both MthK and BK. Since membrane lipid composition cannot be controlled in cells, we will use a bottom-up
approach of purified channels in reconstituted systems to rigorously control lipid composition. We will use
structural, functional, and computational analysis (the last with a collaborator, see letter) on both MthK and BK
channels to reach these goals. Our first aim is to determine the mechanism by which lipids modulate ball-and-
chain inactivation in MthK. Our hypothesis, predicted by MD simulations, is that thicker bilayers bind the
amphipathic ball domain better than thinner bilayers, which will be tested with mutagenesis of the ball domain,
constructs with different chain lengths, and membrane manipulations. This aim was proposed in the previous
grant cycle, we made considerable progress but the mechanism was more complex than anticipated. Hence,
this aim still needs investigation. During the last cycle, we also treated another unexpected finding from the
structure of closed MthK, still in the scope of the grant but not explicitly proposed, which was just published.
Our second aim is to determine the structural correlates of ball-and-chain inactivation in BK channels as well
as how bilayer-thickness and other bilayer properties modulate these channels. We will use b2 and a chimeric
b4-b2 subunit for both structural studies and electrophysiology in HEK cells and liposomes. We will investigate
lipid-dependence of BK channel gating with and without b subunits with stopped-flow assays and single-
channel recordings of purified BK channels reconstituted in liposomes. Channel structures in complex with
lipids will be solved using cryo-EM. The accomplishment of these aims will provide a comprehensive picture of
ball-and-chain inactivation and lipid modulation in calcium-gated potassium channels."
10999776,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
In the context of the gut barrier, Vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid (RA) is central to immune homeostasis in the
gut, coordinating both innate and adaptive immunity. Vitamin A directly regulates proliferation and differentiation
in the intestinal epithelium, which is crucial for maintaining optimal gut barrier. Our work in the last funding cycle
revealed that gut bacteria are crucial in regulating how dietary vitamin A is processed in the intestinal mucosa.
Specifically, we showed for the first time that commensal bacteria suppress RA synthesis in the gut by modulating
the intestinal epithelium’s vitamin A metabolic gene rdh7. Our findings delineated the previously unknown impact
of commensal bacteria on the vitamin A homeostasis, thus opening up questions regarding the role of microbially
regulated RA synthesis on mucosal immunity and epithelial regeneration. Using a mouse model that
constitutively expresses rdh7 gene in IECs we now show that dysregulated epithelium intrinsic RA synthesis is
detrimental to host and results in increased number of IFNγ producing T-cells and enhanced susceptibility to
experimental colitis. We find that overexpressing Rdh7 gene in IECs results in decreased proliferation and repair
upon damage compared to control mice. Additionally, our work establishes that commensal bacteria in the gut
possess vitamin A metabolic activity and significantly increase RA concentration in the gut lumen. Precise role
of bacteria derived RA on epithelial barrier and intestinal immune homeostasis remains to be discovered. We
hypothesize that the host and bacteria collaborate to generate an RA gradient that supports optimal
intestinal epithelium renewal and immune homeostasis. In this grant proposal we will:1) determine the
mechanism by which IEC intrinsic RA regulates T-cell effector responses and whether impact of IEC intrinsic RA
is restricted to T-cells residing in close proximity to IECs. Additionally, we will evaluate the role of IEC intrinsic
rdh7 expression in regulating IFNγ dependent immunity against intestinal pathogens and infection burden
(Aim1), 2) delineate the mechanism by which RA regulates stem cells and assess the role of rdh7 expression in
remodeling stem cell niche during infection via interactions with underlying immune cells (Aim2), and 3)
metabolic difference in ability of gut bacteria to produce RA from pro-form vs pre-form vitamin A to probe the
exclusive role of gut-bacteria sourced RA on host physiology(Aim3). Our work will deliver an unprecedented and
comprehensive understanding of the role of bacterially regulated vitamin A homeostasis in the host. Our Aims
will generate new paradigms for investigating and understanding vitamin A-mediated ISC remodeling. Our work
will provide microbial and dietary interventions that could be therapeutic for diseases with an underlying defect
in ISC regeneration and mucosal immunity."

 Dental fear and anxiety (DFA) characterizes up to 42% of the pediatric population and predicts negative
behaviors in the dental clinic, irregular appointment attendance, need for general anesthesia, and poor oral
health. Sensory over-responsivity (SOR), which occurs in up to 33% of the pediatric population, is a likely
contributor to DFA and may also occur independently from DFA. In the dental clinic, children with SOR may
exhibit behavioral overreactions to lights, sounds, touch, and other sensory stimuli, leading to disruptive
behaviors akin to those associated with DFA. This project will test the Sensory Adapted Dental Environment
(SADE), a novel intervention which provides soothing visual, auditory, and tactile input to reduce children’s
anxiety or fear during dental treatment. In our previous NIDCR-funded R34 study, SADE reduced physiological
anxiety and behavioral distress in both children with autism and typically developing children. Because SADE
utilizes sensory modifications as its key active ingredient, it complements – and could be combined with –
anxiety-reducing strategies such as modeling, a strategy based on social observation and imitation.
 Research participants will be 312 ethnically diverse children aged 6-12 years, 156 with DFA and 156
without. Using a randomized counterbalanced study design, each child will undergo two dental cleanings 4-6
months apart in two of four conditions: SADE in conjunction with video-based modeling (SADE-VBM), SADE
alone (SADE), video-based modeling alone (VBM), and a regular dental environment (RDE).
 As acceptability and feasibility of the SADE intervention and procedures have been established in our
pilot work, in our UG3 planning phase we will assess only the three new elements of the proposed study –
content and delivery of VBM videos, use of a weighted blanket, and recruitment techniques in new settings.
 In the UH3 phase, the specific aims are to conduct a randomized clinical trial to: test SADE-VBM,
SADE, VBM, and RDE’s relative effects on physiological anxiety and behavioral distress during dental
cleaning, as well as on secondary outcomes (Aim 1); assess whether physiological anxiety mediates each
interventions’ effect on behavioral distress, and if DFA and SOR moderate intervention effects on physiological
anxiety and behavioral distress (Aim 2); and conduct exploratory analyses to examine DFA and SOR’s unique
and interactive contributions to overall levels of in-clinic physiological anxiety and behavioral distress, the
intervention’s cost implications, and other methodological issues such as treatment sequencing effects (Aim 3).
 This project is significant because it is the first full-scale RCT of a sensory adapted intervention to modify
the dental environment for typically developing children. Completion of the study aims will enable refinement of
the SADE-based approach to provide a simple, inexpensive, and highly scalable treatment model that we will
later test in a multi-site effectiveness trial. Long-term project outcomes will have excellent potential to benefit
countless children in the US who manifest disruptive anxiety reactions in the dental clinic."
10999570,"ABSTRACT- Nitric oxide (NO) is an essential signaling molecule that mediates dichotomous effects along a
pathophysiological concentration gradient. Low levels maintain physiological homeostasis, while at high
concentrations NO contributes to disease pathogenesis. Although mechanisms of physiologic NO signaling are
relatively well established, these canonical pathways do not sufficiently explain how NO drives pathological
alterations in gene expression. Epigenetic mechanisms, such as methylation of DNA and RNA, are central
regulators of gene expression. Our recent publication and preliminary data demonstrate that NO inhibits DNA
and mRNA demethylases, which causes the enrichment of DNA and mRNA methyl-adducts on genes
transcriptionally regulated by NO. Specifically, our data demonstrate that a concentration gradient of NO
differentially inhibits the activities of both DNA demethylases (TET; ten-eleven translocation, ALKBH2) and
mRNA demethylases (FTO; fat mass and obesity associated protein, ALKBH5) by forming a dinitrosyl iron
complex (DNIC) at the catalytic mononuclear iron atom. We found that each of these Fe(II)/2-oxoglutarate (2-
OG)-dependent demethylases (2-ODD) had a different sensitivity to NO-dependent inhibition. In cells, this
inhibition resulted in gene-specific enrichment of 5mC on DNA and m6A on mRNA; both of which are critical
gene-regulatory methyl-modifications. However, it is unknow whether NO regulates methyl-adducts beyond m6A
and 5mC and whether changes in DNA and mRNA methylation mechanistically drive NO-mediated changes in
gene expression. Thus, we hypothesize that NO differentially inhibits DNA and RNA demethylases in a
concentration-dependent manner to modulate the distribution of methyl-adducts on DNA and RNA, which in turn
control the expression of specific NO-regulated genes. Aim 1 will use isolated 2-ODD enzymes to determine the
structure-function relationship of NO bound to each enzyme. Kinetic studies will delineate the differential
sensitivities of each enzyme to NO. These data will be applied to cellular models to define the effect of a
pathophysiological gradient of NO, through demethylase inhibition, induces differential profiles of multiple methyl-
adducts on DNA/mRNA. Aim 2 will use cell models to identify NO-regulated genes that are also enriched in DNA
and mRNA methyl adducts. With CRISPR techniques we will modify DNA and mRNA methyl-sites and measure
corresponding changes in gene expression to demonstrate a causal-link between NO-dependent DNA/mRNA
methylation and gene expression. These studies will elucidate a novel molecular mechanism of signaling
whereby NO regulates gene expression by inhibiting 2-ODD demethylases in a concentration-dependent manner
thus providing a foundational understanding of the role of NO dysregulation in pathogenic gene expression."

Neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD), formerly “neurogenic bladder,” encompasses bladder and
sphincter abnormalities resulting from neuromuscular diseases or injuries. Conditions such as cerebrovascular
accidents (CVAs), spinal cord injuries (SCIs), and age-related neurogenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and
other types of dementia contribute to NLUTD1. This condition is prevalent, affecting approximately 15% of stroke
patients and 70-84% of those with spinal cord injuries2. Furthermore, NLUTD is found in 40-90% of individuals
with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), 37-72% in those with Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and has been reported in more
than 90% of children with spina bifida3,4. Urinary incontinence in individuals with dementia escalates in tandem
with the severity of the condition, and except for SCI, aging is the primary risk factor for these neurological
conditions5-7. Patients with NLUTD experience drastic effects on quality of life secondary to the development of
urinary tract infections (UTIs), urinary retention, incontinence, renal dysfunction, and autonomic dysreflexia1.
The Neurogenic Bladder Research Group (NBRG) is an academic society dedicated to improving the lives of
patients with NLUTD through application of patient-centered outcomes research. Sequelae of NLUTD are usually
electively managed with a combination of medications, medical devices and surgical approaches. Recently, more
advanced devices have been employed for management of urinary symptoms associated with NLUTD, including
tibial nerve stimulators and sacral neuromodulation systems. However, while these devices improve the quality
of life for patients with neurogenic urinary symptoms, further research and development is critical to maximize
the efficacy and longevity of urologic technology8,9. The overarching goal of this proposal is to host an NBRG
affiliated meeting, which will be the first of its kind, to identify areas in the management of NLUTD that
would benefit from engineering solutions.
To achieve this theme, in Aim 1, leading researchers in engineering and multiple medical specialties, including
urology, neurology, neurosurgery, and pediatrics – as well as patient representatives – will be invited to
participate in active lectures, group discussion, round tables to identify the gaps in NLUTD care that engineering
solutions can address. In Aim 2, guidelines will be written to outline the role of engineers in neurogenic bladder
care and guide the development of engineering solutions in NLUTD for the near future. In Aim 3, engineering,
doctoral, and medical students and junior investigators will be invited to submit abstracts for presentation to
promote early showcasing and mentorship in NLUTD research. Toward the manifestation of these aims, we are
applying for an R13 conference grant. This timely meeting is in full agreement with the missions of the National
Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and the National Institute on Aging (NIA). This
conference will the first to bring together engineers and researchers/clinicians to advance technologic solutions
for the care of NLUTD and to compose a series of guiding principles on the subject."

 Neurodegenerative diseases are devastating age-related disorders that represent a tremendous disease
burden worldwide. The need for effective therapies is increasingly urgent as the population ages. Most familial
adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders are caused by dominantly-transmitted gene defects (e.g. C9ORF72
and SOD1 in ALS, HTT in Huntington’s, -synuclein in Parkinson’s). Thus, one approach toward primary
therapy for such disorders is to suppress expression of the offending genes. RNA-targeted medicines,
including antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), are a promising class of
therapeutics for dominantly-inherited neurodegenerative disorders. Two ASOs have been approved to treat
spinal muscular atrophy and SOD1-dependent ALS, while dozens of others are in clinical trials for
Huntington’s, Alzheimer’s disease, ALS, Parkinson’s disease, genetic epilepsies, and more.
 Nevertheless, there are two key unmet needs in the field of RNA-targeted medicines which require urgent
and focused investment. The first is that the phosphorothioate backbone used in most oligonucleotide drugs
often causes some toxicity when administered into the central nervous system, giving these drugs a narrow
therapeutic index. The second key unmet need is that for many neurodegenerative diseases, silencing one
gene may not be sufficient to provide a meaningful change in disease course. Given the complexity of many of
these diseases, target combinations are likely to have a broader effect on the outcomes than single targets.
 We have developed a platform technology that addresses both of these limitations: during the first term of
our R01 we found that a conjugated molecule containing an siRNA domain and an ASO domain shows very
high safety and efficacy throughout the CNS. We will further develop this ‘platform technology’, seek to
understand the mechanism for its high safety and efficacy relative to previous technologies, and test its ability
to modulate the expression and processing of targets relevant to ALS.
 Applying these insights, we will advance six drug candidates for ALS into extensive testing in iPSC-derived
neurons and animal models of ALS. We will examine the safety, efficacy and duration of effect of our advanced
molecules both at the molecular level and at the level of change in disease phenotype.
 In this proposal, our laboratories will combine innovative chemistry with deep expertise in neurology and
disease-relevant mouse models. We aim to develop broadly applicable platform technology with a substantial
improvement in therapeutic index relative to the ASOs and siRNAs currently in clinical development. Moreover,
we will develop three drugs that silence pairs of targets, and another three drugs that silence one target in
combination with splice modulation of a second target. Successful completion of our work would allow these
candidates to reach the point of readiness for IND-enabling studies and clinical development for the treatment
of familial and sporadic ALS."

Opioid use disorder (OUD) is rare (2%) but associated with extraordinarily high morbidity and mortality. Opioids
are the primary contributors to the soaring numbers of U.S. drug overdose deaths, with increasing co-use of
psychostimulants exacerbating the burden. Alongside this opioid crisis, are increasing rates of cannabis use, a
drug that is now legal for recreational use in 24 states. Early cannabis use onset (eCan) has been documented
in cross-national, cross-sectional, and longitudinal studies to increase the likelihood of using and misusing both
cocaine/psychostimulants and opioids. Shared genetic vulnerability has been suggested as a mechanism
undergirding both eCan and OUD, although it has not been estimated. However, even within discordant twin
pairs, twins who endorse eCan more commonly report stimulant misuse and OUD, when compared to their co-
twins (each at 4 times increased odds), suggesting that genetic factors alone do not explain this association.
Also, rodents pretreated with delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol during adolescence show variable behavioral and
epigenetic responses to opioids and cocaine, suggesting that eCan may modify sensitization to these drugs. Yet,
due to the rarity of OUD in samples that typically assess eCan and the absence of eCan measurement in large
biobanks from which OUD data are drawn, a detailed examination of the association between eCan and opioid
involvement is pending. In this R21 data analysis proposal in response to NOT-DA-22-003, using data from
multiple deeply phenotyped samples, predominantly those ascertained for substance use disorders
(N~138,000), we examine the association between eCan and opioid involvement. In aim 1, we estimate the
association between early cannabis use (eCan) and proximal (e.g., initial subjective responses, indexing
sensitization) and distal aspects of opioid involvement (e.g., OUD criterion count), and whether associations are
modified by co-occurring stimulant (non-prescription, including cocaine) misuse. In aim 2, we test whether eCan
and OUD (including overdose in the presence of psychostimulants) share an architecture of common genetic
influences and parse evidence for non-genetic, putatively causal influences of eCan on opioid involvement using
both genomic causality and data from pairs of twins and siblings discordant for eCan. In aim 3, we estimate the
independent role of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) on eCan and opioid involvement and its interplay
with genetic susceptibility in worsening the likelihood of OUD in those who start using cannabis at an earlier age.
Understanding the relationship between eCan and specific aspects of opioid involvement provides insights into
whether future changes in cannabis use might exacerbate OUD, and establishes targets for experimental and
mechanistic studies. If eCan modifies opioid sensitization and increases likelihood of OUD, or is correlated with
opioid overdose death, then heightened vigilance is urgently needed to delay onsets amidst efforts to legalize
the drug."
11001054,"Opioid use disorder (OUD) and overdose rates have seen a stark rise in incidence throughout the last decade
and continue to pose a devastating threat to the victims, families, and communities affected by addiction. The
emergence of a negative emotional state reflecting a motivational withdrawal symptom when access to the drug
is prevented is a core characteristic of drug addiction and is specifically exacerbated with opioid abuse. However,
current treatment options for those suffering from OUD fail to provide therapeutic relief for many individuals and
effectively substitute more addictive opioids for less addictive versions. Given the role withdrawal avoidance
behavior plays in yielding an exaggerated motivational drive for addictive drugs while simultaneously
compromising executive and inhibitory control of decision making, the central goal of this proposal is to elucidate
a neural code underlying opioid withdrawal and its ability to induce relapse. In Aim 1 (F99), I explain the use of
a custom designed multisite electrode to target 13 brain regions to monitor neural dynamics in opioid withdrawing
mice. Neural features extracted from these recordings are used to train a machine learning model to identify
latent representations that can most optimally and parsimoniously explain and reconstruct the original neural
features. Importantly, in a holdout dataset, this model integrates information that can predict if, and when, a
mouse is in opioid withdrawal. This predictive capacity can generalize to a novel cohort of mice and across
multiple opioid drugs. The discovered network is primarily governed by gamma frequency oscillations between
the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens shell (NAcS). In the remainder of my predoctoral
training, I will investigate the contribution of this circuit activity in withdrawal behavior. I will develop a novel
optogenetic targeting approach to establish a causal link between activity across this circuit, brain-wide network
interactions, and withdrawal-specific behavioral responses. In Aim 2 (K00), I pivot my focus towards
understanding the cellular contributions of distinct cell types in intravenous self-administration models of opioid
relapse and vulnerability to relapse. I am primarily interested in understanding how distinct cell types within
individual brain regions that are predominantly affected by chronic opioid exposure confer aberrant cellular
physiology, leading dysfunction of cells, circuits, networks, and behavior. Moreover, I outline a plan to expand
my existing technical skills to include transcriptional profiling, monitoring of in vivo cellular dynamics, and new
addiction paradigm. In my Training Plan, I detail past, ongoing, and future efforts to further cultivate my technical
development, professional and career development, written and oral communication, and mentorship and
leadership. This proposal seeks to address BRAIN Initiative's Scientific Review and High Priority Research Areas
for monitoring neural activity, interventional tools, and theory & data analysis tools. Together, these specialized
and creative training skills cultivate a unique scientific repertoire that positions me initiate my transition to an
independent academic research career."

A diverse biomedical workforce is critical for scientific innovation and health equity. Yet, underrepresented
racial/ethnic (UR) scientists and women remain disproportionately low, particularly as faculty at academic
research institutions. Multiple evidence-based strategies need to be implemented to enhance faculty diversity,
inclusion and to create cultures of inclusive excellence. However, a knowledge gap exists regarding integrated
strategies to address diversity and inclusion, the impact of faculty cluster hiring, and institutional change models
on fostering inclusive excellence. The overall goal of the University of California San Diego (UCSD) NIH Faculty
Institutional Recruitment for Sustainable Transformation (FIRST) Program is to: 1) foster sustainable institutional
culture change, 2) promote institutional excellence by hiring a diverse cohort of faculty and 3) support faculty
development, mentoring, sponsorship and promotion. The objectives are to: 1) demonstrate institutional support,
develop or modify a strategic plan with elements that will be implemented to achieve systemic and sustainable
institutional culture changes towards inclusive excellence, 2) develop an evaluation plan to assess impact on the
institution towards achieving FIRST program goals, 3) conduct recruitment of new faculty, outline institutional
commitments, and develop recruitment committees based on commitments to diversity, equity and inclusion, 4)
establish a retention plan to secure institutional commitment and a supportive environment for new faculty hires,
5) establish individual research and career development plans, mentorship plans and 6) develop strategies to
reduce isolation, increase community building and foster career development for all new faculty hires. The
primary hypothesis is that a cohort model of faculty hiring, sponsorship, continual mentorship and support for
professional development, embedded within an institution implementing evidenced-based practices to create
academic cultures of inclusive excellence will achieve significant improvements in metrics of institutional culture
and scientific workforce diversity. We propose the following Specific Aims. Aim 1. The aim of the Administrative
Core is to provide strategic leadership, management, and administrative oversight to support the recruitment
and retention UCSD FIRST faculty and oversee implementation professional development and institutional
transformation for inclusive excellence. Aim 2. The aim of the Faculty Development Core is to use evidence-
based strategies to enhance FIRST faculty academic advancement, research success, and inclusive institutional
excellence. Aim 3. The aim of the Evaluation Core is to develop and implement an evaluation plan to assess the
institutional impact of the FIRST Program and to assist the Coordination and Evaluation Center evaluation of the
combined FIRST Cohort Programs. Together, these aims will promote institutional culture change at UC San
Diego towards inclusive excellence by using evidence-based strategies to enhance UR faculty recruitment,
academic advancement, research and career development, integration and implementation of system-wide
structured faculty development programs to enhance inclusivity."

The NIH Faculty Institutional Recruitment for Sustainable Transformation (FIRST) initiative aims to transform
institutional culture by developing communities of biomedical researchers and supporting institutions that are
committed to increasing diversity and inclusive excellence. The University of New Mexico (UNM) is a Hispanic
Serving Institution, and a Carnegie Very High Research Activity institution. Thus, recruitment and retention of a
diverse biomedical faculty workforce aligns with the NIH mission and will promote inclusive excellence in a
majority-minority state. The UNM FIRST program is hiring nine early career faculty across six STEM
departments. The cohort will consist of two interdisciplinary clusters: neuroscience and data science. The
central hypothesis is that this model will successfully hire and retain a diverse cohort of early career faculty and
the changes implemented as part of UNM FIRST will support the enhancement of inclusive excellence
practices across UNM. The long-term goal is to increase the diversity of the NIH biomedical faculty workforce
while building on recent progress toward inclusive excellence in our institutional culture. Our specific aims are:
To recruit, promote, and retain a diverse cohort of biomedical faculty, and to systemically transform UNM’s
culture towards inclusive excellence. The UNM FIRST Leadership Team, which is comprised of five female
leaders at UNM, is working closely with the UNM Leadership. The latter includes an Institutional Innovation
Implementation Board (Senior Vice Provost, Vice President for Research, Associate Provost for Faculty
Success, College of Arts & Sciences Dean, and ADVANCE Director) that was created to support UNM FIRST
and is poised to work closely with the UNM FIRST Leadership Team. The significance of the UNM FIRST
program is that a diverse cohort of NIH-funded biomedical faculty devoted to inclusive excellence will achieve
success as UNM faculty, that UNM will become an institution where inclusive excellence is permanently
established, and that UNM faculty (including UNM FIRST faculty) will train the next generation of diverse NIH-
funded scientists. Importantly, this supplemental funding will provide support for the UNM FIRST faculty hires
to attend the annual NIH FIRST Annual Grantees Conference. The goals of UNM FIRST faculty participation in
this conference are to: extend their peer network and thereby increase collaboration and support opportunities,
facilitate their communication within this network about academic challenges faced and solutions reached,
increase their nationwide network among the participating program faculty (e.g., PIs/MPIs) and NIH staff, and
enhance their overall professional development."
11002899,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted how one respiratory RNA virus can induce a tremendous diversity of
host outcomes. While we have made progress in understanding clinical, cellular, and molecular correlates of
disease severity, few studies have assessed if or how specific factors present at baseline may induce severe
disease. There is a tremendous knowledge gap in whether correlates of disease severity represent causal factors
(i.e. if presence at baseline lead to more severe infection), or may actually represent generally beneficial attempts
at restoring tissue function (i.e. a resilience mechanism), that are detrimental only in select host contexts. Despite
distinct biology of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, epidemiological studies have noted that overweight and obese
individuals are at greater risk for severe infection, implicating lipid metabolism, and further genetic studies have
found mutations in the Type I/III interferon system in severe cases. Importantly, treating the underlying causes
of severe viral respiratory diseases will require a deeper understanding of the epithelial cell states that contribute
to diverse outcomes to design host-directed therapies that complement vaccination campaigns and avoid long-
lasting damage to the respiratory and cardiovascular systems.
Recently through single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of nasopharyngeal swabs, we have discovered that
a muted interferon antiviral response combined with an increase in intracellular cholesterol biosynthesis potential
in respiratory epithelial cells characterizes severe vs. mild-moderate COVID-19. In this same study, we also
revealed diversified subsets of secretory and goblet cells with uncharacterized functional potential, overlapping
with subsets we had previously identified in a study of seasonal influenza. Our published data, together with that
of our colleagues, mandate further investigation into how pre-existing antiviral and cholesterol biosynthetic cell
states in human respiratory epithelial cells dictate host outcomes to respiratory viral infection.
In light of these findings, we hypothesize that baseline cholesterol biosynthesis in respiratory epithelial cells is
a critical host resilience mechanism which becomes pathogenic in the absence of effective antiviral resistance
mechanisms. This overarching hypothesis can only be tested through a shift in the conceptual and experimental
approaches we traditionally deploy (New Research Direction). Successfully testing our hypothesis will address
(Aim 1) whether cholesterol biosynthesis dictates the maximum potential interferon response in airway epithelial
cells, or whether a muted interferon response underlies enhanced cholesterol biosynthesis in mice. Furthermore,
it will identify novel contributions of airway epithelial cells to local and organismal lipid metabolism. Our work will
also test (Aim 2) the stability of metabolic and antiviral cellular phenotypes in human epithelial progenitor cells.
Successful completion of our plan will lead to the development of non-invasive screening approaches to better
ascertain risk of susceptible populations to respiratory viruses, and of prophylactic and therapeutic strategies to
achieve optimal balance of host defense strategies in the respiratory tract."
11002948,"The aim of the proposed administrative supplement is to conduct enhanced computerized
tomography (CT) of the brain, mouth/jaw, neck, abdominal aorta, spine, and pelvis by making
use of a newly available CT scanner in Bolivia. The new Canon Aquilion Prime SP CT scanner

requested for the increased costs of the enhanced scanning capabilities and to increase
imaging coverage to include the abdomen and pelvis, extending the measurement of
arteriosclerosis to other arterial beds."
10926898,"Project 3: Statistical Methods for Genome Characterization
Abstract
Understanding the role that genes play in life is a key issue in biomedical sciences, yet the
overwhelming majority of sequences in public databases remain uncharacterized. Functional
annotation is important for a variety of downstream analyses of genetic data. Yet experimental
characterization of function remains costly and slow, making computational prediction an
important endeavor. This project therefore proposes three Aims focused on functional genomics.
In our first Specific Aim, we propose to develop a probabilistic evolutionary model built upon
phylogenetic trees and experimental Gene Ontology functional annotations that allows automated
prediction of function for unannotated genes. We will develop a probabilistic hierarchical modeling
framework that that will allow joint inference, and borrowing of strength, across a family of related
trees. We expect this to significantly improve overall accuracy. Our approach will provide a
scalable computational method that will enable gene annotation to be kept up to date regardless
of the flow of new experimental data. Our second Aim focuses on the development of improved
statistical methods for pathway analysis. Such methods aim to detect over-representation of
members of a super-structure, such as a genetic pathway, in a list of objects of interest from an
experimental or statistical analysis. However, pathway definitions are not consistent between
resources, with the overlap between two definitions of the same pathway on differing resources
being as low as 30%. In this Aim we will develop methods that focus on the network structure
itself, which is much more robust. Our third Aim focuses on analysis of epigenetic conservation.
The epigenome dictates cell phenotype and it is increasingly possible to infer which genes are
silenced or expressed by measuring the epigenome of a cell. Cancers are characterized by
multiple genes that show both hypermethylation and hypomethylation relative to normal tissues.
We will develop advanced statistical methods to assess how conservation of DNA methylation
varies along the genome, and validated using measures of ‘essentiality’ taken from the Cancer
Dependency Map and drug sensitivity data taken from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer
(GDSC) Project."
11002762,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This collaborative project between Beijing Normal University, Brown University, and Emory University responds
to PAR-23-190 by developing and testing a stigma reduction focused, gender affirmative mobile health (mHealth)
program to engage Chinese transgender women (TW) in HIV prevention via promoting their mental and sexual
health, HIV self-testing and use of HIV and gender-related community and medical resources. Chinese TW are
at threefold higher odds of HIV infection compared to their cisgender men who have sex with men peers yet no
intervention or public health initiative exists to address their HIV prevention needs. Chinese TW also face multi-
levels gender minority stress in a high stigma societal context, which in turn adversely affects their behavioral
health, awareness of services, and HIV service-seeking behaviors (e.g., testing), which ultimately contribute to
heightened HIV risk. There is an urgent need for evidence-based gender affirmative program as a potential way
to engage TW in HIV prevention services and enhance their psychological and sexual health in high-stigma,
LMIC contexts such as China. Building on the Gender Minority Stress framework and Transgender Resilience
Intervention Model, and informed by our team’s prior work mHealth for HIV-related mental and behavioral health,
we propose to develop a mobile app-based intervention (entitled “Zhen Wo”/”True Self”) delivered by TW peer
counselors, who will provide gender-affirmative counseling and skills training that aim to reduce internalized
transphobia and sexual risk behaviors, enhance coping and mental health, self-advocacy skills and resource
utilization to combat multi-levels gender stigma and structural barriers, and promote engagement in HIV
prevention services. By developing a low-cost, mHealth program delivered by TW peers and establishing a
protocol that engages with existing community resources, the True Self program has the potential to achieve
scalability and sustainability, if proven to be efficacious. The aims of this early phase, clinical project include: (1)
conduct formative interviews with Chinese TW (n = 25) and stakeholders (n = 10) to identify stigma-related
factors at various levels that contribute to poor mental health, sexual risk, and HIV testing, coping strategies,
resources, and preferences for intervention content and delivery procedures; (2) develop the True Self program
for Chinese TW at risk for HIV, followed by a small open pilot (n = 10) to finalize intervention protocol; (3) evaluate
the feasibility, acceptability, safety, and preliminary effects of the True Self program via a randomized controlled
trial (RCT) with TW with recent condomless/PrEP-less sex (n = 60). We will conduct quantitative assessments
at baseline, 3-month, and 6-months follow-ups. We will conduct exit-interviews with TW assigned to the True
Self condition (n = 30) to identify areas for further improvement and understand barriers and facilitators of
engagement, along with interviews with stakeholders (n = 18) to inform future efficacy and implementation study
designs. This developmental grant will provide essential data to guide subsequent R-series application for a fully-
powered RCT and invest in capacity development for researchers and transgender health professionals in China."

Sle1, the strongest lupus susceptibility locus in the NZM2410 mouse model, is responsible for the loss of
tolerance to chromatin, including the production of autoreactive CD4+ T cells. It corresponds to a cluster of loci,
including Sle1a1 that enhances effector CD4+ T cell function and reduces the number and function of peripheral
(p)Treg cells. Sle1a1 corresponds to the expression of Pbx1-d, a splice isoform of the transcription factor Pbx1
that lacks the DNA- and Hox-binding domains, as compared to Pbx1-b, the common isoform in lymphocytes.
Pbx1-d is expressed at a higher level in CD4+ T cells from B6.Sle1a1 and NZM2410 mice, and from SLE patients,
as compared to B6 mice and healthy controls (HC). Importantly, the PBX1 isoforms and the protein sequence
are identical between mice and humans. In the previous cycle of funding, we showed that either Pbx1-d Tg
expression in T cells or the FOXP3-specific deletion of Pbx1 impaired the maintenance of pTregs, resulting in a
global CD4+ T cell activation, which increased atherogenic lesions as well as autoimmunity in dyslipidemic mice.
Our work therefore established a novel role for Pbx1 to maintain Treg homeostasis. We also showed that Pbx1
expression in CD4+ T cells is the highest in Tregs, and that Pbx1-d is a dysfunctional protein through multiple
mechanisms. Our work is the first to associate a specific genetic variation to the well-documented alterations in
Tregs in human and mouse lupus. A SNP decreasing PBX1 expression in B cells has also been recently
associated to SLE susceptibility and a B-cell specific deletion of Pbx1 enhanced B cell responses in mice.
Therefore, Pbx1 represents a unique lupus susceptibility gene in both mice and humans that impairs Tregs
through the over-expression of Pbx1-d and B cells through a reduced global expression. In this competitive
renewal, we propose to characterize the mechanisms by which Pbx1 regulates pTreg maintenance and function
at the molecular and cellular levels, and how this process is altered by the expression of lupus-susceptibility
allele Pbx1-d. In addition, we propose to characterize the combined effects of a reduced Pbx1 expression in B
cells and overexpression of Pbx1-d in Tregs to comprehensively define the contribution of Pbx1 to lupus
susceptibility. To achieve these goals, we propose three specific aims conducted in mice as well as in PBMCs
obtained from SLE patients and HCs. Aim 1. To characterize the functional consequences of Pbx1-d expression
in Tregs using cellular assays with murine cells that express only Pbx1-b or Pbx1-d, and human cells based on
their PBX1-D expression. Aim 2. To define the molecular pathways regulated by Pbx1 and Pbx1-d in Tregs with
gene expression profiling, Pbx1 binding sites and chromatin accessibility, scRNA-Seq, and proteomics. Aim 3.
To define the consequences of Pbx1-deficiency or Pbx1-d expression in Tregs combined with Pbx1 deficiency
in B cells. The proposed experiments will provide for the first time a comprehensive molecular and cellular
roadmap to Pbx1-d and/or a reduced Pbx1 expression leading to lupus susceptibility, as well as novel insights
on the role of Pbx1 in the regulation of T and B cell functions in mice and humans."

10983879,"Project Summary
To divide, move, and communicate, cells rely on a dynamic actin cytoskeleton that can rapidly assemble and
change. This is achieved by the polymerization of actin monomers into filaments, the construction of filament
networks, and the disassembly of these networks back into monomers. Cells maintain a large monomer reserve
to meet the demands of actin network assembly. Because of its size, the monomer pool was traditionally
considered to be homogeneous. However, recent work by us and others has revealed distinct subgroups of
monomers that can drive and modify actin dynamics in ways that profoundly influence cell behavior. These
discoveries have shown us that the rules of monomer polymerization are much more complex than previously
thought. Addressing this severe knowledge gap in one of the most fundamental aspects of cytoskeletal biology
is paramount to understanding how actin functions in cells. It may also finally reveal why defects in monomer
regulation are associated with neurodegeneration, inflammatory disorders, cardiac disease and cancer.
Most of our current knowledge about actin monomer behavior comes from solution biochemistry. However, these
types of experiments cannot reproduce the complex monomer-driven actin dynamics seen in cells. Therefore,
we are devising strategies that merge biochemical principles with cellular imaging to reveal how monomeric actin
regulates the cytoskeleton in living cells. This includes controlling protein levels with micromolar precision, using
quantitative image analysis to extract rate constants and concentrations, and employing computational models
to reveal how cellular geometry influences actin dynamics. Additionally, we are developing new tools to describe
and quantify actin ultrastructure from super-resolution images. We will use these innovative approaches to
address the following fundamental knowledge gaps about monomer-driven actin dynamics: 1) How monomers
control the dynamics of complex actin networks, 2) How cell geometry contributes to monomer-regulated actin
dynamics, and 3) Novel roles for monomers in the regulation of cellular processes."
10981641,"ABSTRACT
Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI) is an anticoagulant protein with essential roles in hemostasis,
thrombosis, and embryonic development. TFPI was originally identified as the primary inhibitor of TF-FVIIa, the
catalytic complex that initiates blood coagulation. We recognized that the basic C-terminal region of TFPIα and
the basic region of the FV B-domain have homology and sought to define how TFPIα may specifically interact
with FV/FVa. In biochemical studies, we described an interaction between TFPIα and FVa that promotes
inhibition of nascent prothrombinase (FXa-FVa). This occurs at a previously unrecognized regulatory step in
the blood coagulation cascade when FV has been activated by FXa but before thrombin is generated. The
physiological importance of the TFPI-FV interaction is demonstrated by the following: 1) Bleeding disorders are
associated with FV variants that tightly bind TFPIα through this mechanism; 2) TFPIα has reduced ability to
inhibit prothrombinase assembled with FV Leiden (FVL) and likely contributes to the thrombotic disease
associated with this variant; and 3) Mice lacking TFPI activity have defects in cerebrovascular development
that contribute to their embryonic lethality, and removing FV from the embryos completely rescues the brain
pathology. We want to better understand how inhibition of prothrombinase by TFPIα impacts biological
processes. The proposed studies are based on recently published and new preliminary findings to define
extravascular locations where TFPIα interacts with FV and to probe how TFPI alters thrombotic disease,
placental development, and responses to endothelial damage. Aim 1 builds on our finding that heparin
releasable TFPIα originates from extracellular matrix (ECM) rather than the endothelial surface. Proposed
studies will define specific TFPIα binding proteins in ECM, the impact of binding ECM on TFPIα inhibitory
activity, and how TFPIα competes with growth factors for ECM binding. Aim 2 builds on our finding that TFPIα
and its interaction with FV modulates placental development, which will be probed using three mouse models
of TFPI deficiency. Aim 3 builds on our finding that platelet TFPIα modifies development of cardiac fibrosis
following irradiation. Proposed studies will further define the role of platelet TFPIα vs. other forms of TFPI in
this process. Together, the results of the proposed experiments will advance our understanding of how the
TFPIα-FV interaction modulates the pathophysiology of coagulation and coagulation-mediated cellular
signaling in important biological processes. They will potentially lead to new therapeutic approaches for
thrombotic diseases and bleeding disorders."

Approximately 1 out of every 3 adults experiencing homelessness has a current alcohol use disorder (AUD).
Alcohol use plays a central role in increased morbidity and mortality in this population, with some studies
suggesting it plays a direct role in as many of 17% of deaths. Alcohol is also the leading cause of
homelessness and contributes to its chronicity by inhibiting progress towards obtaining employment and a
stable living environment. Shelter-based treatments are common, but compliance is often poor. There are
many documented challenges to effectively implementing traditional evidence-based interventions in shelter
settings. Smartphone ownership and use are now widespread even among unhoused adults, with a 2017
estimate indicating that the majority own a smartphone. This number is likely to continue increasing with the
availability of government subsidized smartphones and service (i.e., Lifeline program). Technical literacy and
interest in technology-based interventions are similarly high. Smartphone-based treatments may offer unique
benefits for this population, given the many barriers to seeking and accessing traditional treatments. The
proposed project will build upon preliminary data that were collected in our recently completed NIAAA R34
study. This study identified environmental, cognitive, and behavioral antecedents to alcohol use, used this
information to develop an algorithm for delivering tailored messages based on imminent drinking risk, and then
conducted a pilot trial in 41 adults experiencing homelessness. Results indicated intervention feasibility and
acceptability and the intervention corresponded with a 50% decrease in alcohol use from baseline. In the
proposed project, we seek to scale this preliminary work by conducting a randomized controlled trial. Adults
currently experiencing homelessness who report hazardous alcohol use (N = 600) will be recruited from five
shelters across the Dallas, TX and Oklahoma City, OK metropolitan areas. Individuals will attend screening
and training visits, then complete one week of self-monitoring (via smartphone app) before being randomized
to receive either standard shelter-based treatment (Usual Care; UC), or the Smart-T Alcohol intervention + UC.
The Smart-T Alcohol intervention offers on-demand content and automated contextually tailored messages to
reduce alcohol consumption. The intervention period will span eight-weeks (i.e., weeks 2-9), with follow-up
assessments occurring at weeks 9, 13, and 26. All participants will complete brief daily smartphone-based
surveys for 13 weeks. Aims of the project will be to assess the effects of the Smart-T Alcohol intervention on
alcohol use and alcohol-related problems (Aim 1), intervention effects on key drinking risk indicators and their
mediation of use outcomes (Aim 2), and identify specific subpopulations (e.g., women, racial/ethnic minorities,
younger adults; Exploratory Aim 3) for which the intervention is most effective. Findings will provide a rigorous
evaluation of the efficacy of the Smart-T Alcohol intervention and guide future smartphone-based interventions
for this population."

Chronic liver diseases are on the rise and are associated with almost $100 billion in healthcare
costs in the United States. Since the liver is a primary site for detoxification and metabolizes a
variety of chemicals, prescription drugs, and nutrients, it is prone to constant damage. To cope
with the insults, the liver has inherent mechanisms, including division of labor, polyploidy, and
injury-associated liver regeneration.
Although liver metabolism and liver diseases exhibit sexual dimorphism, studies focused on
understanding sex differences in liver injury and regeneration are lacking. The nuclear receptor,
Constitutive Androstane receptor (CAR), controls detoxification, and several metabolic pathways
and is linked to liver growth. But spatiotemporal and sex-specific CAR-mediated regulation
remains unexplored. We still do not know if and how CAR (i) regulates zonation and if CAR
targets distinct genes in the different zones of the liver, (ii) controls polyploidy and injury-
associated regeneration, (iii) influences estrogen receptor α (ERα)-mediated signaling, and (iv)
contributes to the sex differences seen in liver metabolism and functions. This study is designed
to address these gaps.
In this renewal, we combine high throughput analysis of transcriptomes and cistromes using a
novel epitope-tagged FLAG-CAR mouse and different chemical-based liver injury models to
decipher how CAR orchestrates various aspects of hepatic metabolism and functions. In specific
aim 1, we will determine if CAR is necessary for metabolic maturation and maintaining
heterogeneity of hepatocytes, whereas in specific aim 2, we will determine the role of the CAR-
ERα axis in regulating sex differences in polyploidy and regeneration in the liver.
The long-term objective of these studies is to gain comprehensive understanding of the molecular
mechanisms that integrate metabolic functions and liver regeneration and growth. Our proposed
studies will uncover new insights and elaborate on a fundamental aspect of CAR in controlling the
metabolic fitness of hepatocytes. This knowledge, in turn, can be maneuvered to prevent and or
treat liver diseases."

 Falls by older adults are often predictable and preventable, yet there is a notable lack of research evaluating
interventions to reduce the occurrence of recurrent falls in older adult Emergency Department (ED) patients.
Dr. Goldberg’s Beeson K76 project GAPcare II, the Geriatric Acute & Post-acute Care Coordination Program
for Fall Prevention in the Emergency Department, addresses this lack of research by further refining and
examining the intervention she created in her GEMSSTAR R03 project. In this intervention, patients,
caregivers, physical therapists (PTs), pharmacy specialists, and clinicians provide a patient-centric,
collaborative approach to fall prevention that bridges the ED visit with outpatient resources. PTs evaluate
geriatric patients in the ED immediately after their fall, perform a focused assessment of future fall risk and
determine the safety of discharge home. Pharmacists in the ED perform a medication therapy management
session aimed at reducing/tapering fall risk increasing medication. ED clinicians, patients and caregivers in
turn incorporate the advice offered by these professionals before the patient leaves the ED.
 In her Beeson K76 GAPcare II project, Dr. Goldberg will build on the lessons learned from the GEMSSTAR
R03 work. GAPcare II’s specific aims are to: (1) conduct field testing with geriatric patients with and without
cognitive impairment and their caregivers to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of the Apple
Watch to objectively measure fall-related outcomes; (2) refine the GAPcare intervention and study protocol
based on lessons learned and findings from the GEMSSTAR R03 GAPcare I pilot study and conduct a small
open trial of the GAPcare II intervention; and (3) conduct a pilot randomized, controlled trial (RCT) of the
GAPcare II (n=200) intervention to obtain initial estimates of efficacy of GAPcare II to decrease recurrent falls
at 12 months relative to usual care. This investigation will provide Dr. Goldberg with critical pilot data and
expertise to submit a R01 proposal to NIA for a full-scale, multi-center, comprehensive RCT.
 Dr. Goldberg’s Beeson K76 award overarching aims are to develop and test an ED-based and post-discharge
protocol that reduces recurrent falls in older adults and to launch her physician-scientist career as an emerging
leader in geriatric emergency medicine. To achieve this goal, Dr. Goldberg will obtain additional training in
qualitative research, digital health, longitudinal data analysis, clinical trial methods, and leadership. This
expertise will be achieved through advanced coursework, leadership training, and intensive interactions with
her mentorship team. Her primary mentors, Dr. Roland Merchant, emergency medicine physician and
epidemiologist, and Dr. Vincent Mor, health services researcher and health policy expert, will provide training
in epidemiology, health services research, and leading policy initiatives. Her mentorship team also includes
experts in qualitative research, digital health, rehabilitation measures, longitudinal data analysis, clinical trial
methods, fall prevention and geriatric medication management."
10984241,"Abstract A critical component in in successfully conducting clinical and translational (C&T) research is to
achieve the optimal standards of rigor and reproducibility of research methods, and the Research Design,
Compliance and Data Management (RDCD) Core is strategically designed to achieve this goal by providing
the infrastructure and expertise necessary for high-quality, innovative C&T research within the CLINTRUSC
research network. With expertise in biostatistics, research study design, and electronic heath record (her), the
RDCD core will provide C&T researchers across CLINTRUSC with training, consultation, and collaboration.
Specifically, we will enhance research compliance by training and mentoring CLINTRUSC
investigators/professional staff in conducting C&T human subjects research including observational and
prospective studies (Aim 1); provide C&R researchers in the CLINTRUSC network with biostatistics and
research design support including assistance with designing clinical and community-based study protocols,
and performing sample size calculations, power calculations, and biostatistical analyses to ensure rigor and
avoid methodological bias (Aim 2); and establish and enhance procedures to facilitate the use of EHR for
research, including data acquisition, curation, management, and analysis (Aim 3). In addition, the RDCD Core
will work in close collaboration with other CLINTRUSC Cores, including the Administrative Core (Aims 1-3),
Professional Development Core (Aim 1), and the Health Research (Aims 2-3) Cores. The RDCD core will
interact across CLINTRUSC network to ensure that RDCD expertise is effectively distributed across the entire
CLINTRUSC in a manner proportional to the need for RDCD expertise. Metrics to measure impact of the
RDCD Core include the number of 1) research consultations; 2) collaborative grant proposals submitted and
funded; 3) collaborative manuscripts; 4) citations to this work; 5) workshops and seminars organized; 6)
individuals put on local protocols; and 7) junior faculty researchers mentored.
The RDCD Core’s underlying premise is that embedding RDCD expertise in CLINTRUSC in a transdisciplinary
team science environment will elevate the quality of the research and facilitate a more rapid translation into
improved health. To achieve this, the RDCD Core will promote leading-edge, innovative clinical, and
translational research to ensure that scientific questions are addressed using optimally efficient, unbiased
study designs and applying appropriate analytic approaches, cultivate expertise in C&T in biostatistics, data
science, data security, data cybersecurity and artificial intelligence to support RDCD Core needs, and enhance
research infrastructure. The endeavors will support the overall goal of CLINTRUSC: to positively impact
population health by carrying out impactful translational research with the promise of improving evidence-
based clinical medicine and public health practice."

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory dermatosis that causes recurrent scarring abscesses
and tunnels in the groin, axillae, and perineum. It affects approximately 325,000 Americans, predominantly
women and African Americans. Outside the US, 1% of people from high-income countries suffer from it. HS
causes recurrent scarring abscesses and reduced quality of life. Most patients live with constant pain, and this
leads to chronic opioid use, impaired relationships, and higher suicide risk. Patients with HS are 2-3 times more
likely to commit suicide than the general population, and this association is even stronger among women. There
is one FDA-approved cure, but it is effective only in 50% of those with moderate to severe disease. A better
understanding of HS pathogenesis is needed to develop novel treatment strategies to improve the quality of life
in those living with this devastating disease.
 Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), a ubiquitous gamma herpesvirus is associated with several autoimmune diseases
including Rheumatoid arthritis, Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. A recent
longitudinal study with a large cohort provided strong evidence that EBV is a trigger for autoimmunity by
observing that EBV infection increased the risk of future MS onset by 32-fold. While the mechanisms by which
EBV may trigger autoimmunity are unclear, there is compelling evidence that chronic EBV reactivation and
molecular mimicry between EBV and human proteins are factors.
 Our preliminary data, suggests a link between EBV and HS. In preliminary studies, we compared sera from
HS patients with controls. We found that HS patients make antibodies that are reactive to (a) select epitopes in
EBV and (b) human self-antigens. Non-HS control individuals make antibodies against EBV but they do not make
antibodies against the expanded set of EBV epitopes that the HS patients do. These preliminary results suggest
a linkage between immune reactivity to novel EBV epitopes and self-antigens in HS. Interestingly, preliminary
studies show that HS skin lesions contain pauciclonal, class-switched, somatically mutated B cells and plasma
cells. The specificity of the antibodies encoded are unknown, and whether these play a crucial role in HS
pathogenesis remains unclear as well. Here we propose to (i) determine the clonal dynamics of B cells and
plasma cells in HS skin lesions (Aim 1), (ii) recreate human monoclonal antibodies encoded by these cells, and
test their ability to bind EBV and self-antigens. We will also map the unique epitopes in EBV targeted by these
HS skin lesion-derived monoclonal antibodies. We will then test if these EBV epitopes can be used as an ELISA
screening tool to assess disease severity in HS patients (Aim 2). The proposed work is significant because the
knowledge gained from these studies will help better understand the link between EBV and HS pathogenesis
and may help identify novel therapeutic strategies to reduce pain and suffering."

Early language skills have been linked to experience with language in the real world. However, the majority of
this research has focused on infant’s experiences with adult caregivers. The majority of children, however,
hear language from other children, in addition to adult caregivers, whether that be in the home, on the
playground, or in childcare settings, to name a few. In fact, 80% of US children have at least one sibling
(Census data, 2010), and out pilot data suggests that infants with siblings hear speech from children every
49s. However, having an older sibling seems to have a negative effect on language development, with younger
siblings showing slower language development than first-born children. The proposed work investigates how
speech from young children may influence language development, in an effort to understand why language
development differs for later- relative to first-born children. Its overall objective is to establish how infants
process speech from children relative to adults, whether speech from children differs systematically in content
and complexity, and how processing of child-produced speech and the content of child-produced speech
influence language development.
Aim 1 tests two central facets of speech perception: preferences for speech produced by children vs. adults,
and word recognition for speech produced by children vs. adults. Aim 2 collects and fully transcribes a corpus
of play sessions between a parent, sibling, and young infant, to understand what older siblings say in the
presence of younger infants, and how that differs from the input their receive from adult caregivers. Aim 3 asks
whether infant’s preference for or processing of child-produced speech from Aim 1 relates to their vocabulary
growth at 18 months, and whether infant’s own experiences with child-produced speech during play sessions
from Aim 2 also shapes vocabulary growth at 18 months.
Results from this set of Aims will provide important information about the role of child-produced speech in early
language development. Understanding whether speech from young children is preferentially attended to by
infants, and whether it provides different content for infants to learn from will inform how we can differentially
support language development for infants who may have different experiences with child-produced speech,
which is likely to vary across cultures, linguistic backgrounds, and socioeconomic status."
10988797,"Project Description
The advancement of regenerative medicine has provided many new potential treatments for craniofacial bone
defects, in which mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSCs) play a critical role in maintaining constant
remodeling of tissue architecture. The neural crest derived orofacial MSCs (OMSCs), such as stem cells from
apical papilla (SCAP) are attractive postnatal stem cells for hard tissue regeneration, based on their superior
osteogenic properties compared to their bone marrow counterparts. However, clinical translation remains
challenging due to limited knowledge about the mechanisms of action. Ferumoxytol, an FDA-approved iron
oxide nanoparticle formulation, exhibits several biomedical properties including anticancer and
immunomodulation, based on its inherent physicochemical properties that activates cell proliferation, migration,
and differentiation. Given these properties, ferumoxytol could be applied in MSC-based tissue regeneration, an
unexplored avenue. Specifically, our goal is to identify whether ferumoxytol can activate orofacial MSCs and
promote their multipotent differentiation capabilities and immunomodulation for endogenous tissue
regeneration. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis and in vitro MSC characterization, we found
intriguing data demonstrating that: 1) ferumoxytol significantly promotes stemness of SCAP through elevation
of MSC markers and osteogenic progenitor markers, 2) proliferation and osteogenic capabilities are highly
activated in SCAP after ferumoxytol treatment, 3) ferumoxytol largely increased immunomodulation of SCAP
via PGE2/IDO cascades, and 4) YAP/TAZ are required mediators in ferumoxytol-mediated metabolic
reconfiguration of SCAP for tissue regeneration. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that ferumoxytol
activates YAP/TAZ signaling and promotes stemness of orofacial MSCs, which provides a favorable
physiochemical microenvironment for enhancement of MSC viability and osteogenesis for
autotherapies. During this proposal, I will explore the role of ferumoxytol in activation of somatic OMSCs to
address how YAP/TAZ-mediated metabolic switch regulates OMSC homeostasis (Aim 1). Since immune
components can impair somatic stem cell function and ferumoxytol treatment significantly elevated cell
proliferation and osteogenesis through activation of YAP/TAZ cascades, we will determine whether activation
of YAP/TAZ by ferumoxytol treatment may elevate endogenous craniofacial tissue regeneration in a ligature-
induced periodontitis mouse model. A tetracycline-inducible postnatal neural-crest-specific YAP/TAZ knockout
mouse model will be generated to examine in vivo stem cell behavior and endogenous tissue regeneration
ability (Aim 2). Upon successful completion of the Specific Aims, this translational study will extend our
knowledge in activating somatic stem cell abilities through repurposing an FDA approved nanoformulation for a
new biomedical application."

Research has documented that gender-based violence (GBV; e.g. intimate partner violence, sexual assault, child abuse,
hate-motivated violence) disproportionately impacts sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations, with unaddressed
victimization experiences representing a key driver of SGM health disparities (e.g., suicidality, substance use, depression,
HIV transmission, morbidity, mortality). To advance from identifying these disparities to intervening, research that
evaluates SGM barriers to seeking help and GBV recovery needs, as well as the social, cultural, and structural influences
of these processes at multiple levels is required. There is a scarcity of tools to measure GBV-specific concepts validated in
SGM populations, with no current instruments to measure the help-seeking barriers SGM survivors face and their
recovery progress. Thus, there is a critical need to develop these instruments to inform acceptable and effective
interventions to increase the access, engagement, care linkages, and effectiveness of survivor support infrastructure for
SGM populations. Through an exploratory sequential mixed-methods approach, we aim to: 1) develop an SGM Barriers
to Help-seeking and an SGM GBV Healing Scale and 2) psychometrically evaluate these instruments. Study aims will
draw on four sequentially collected sources of data: a) an existing dataset of SGM ethnographic narrative interviews
(N=40, n=20 gender minority survivors), b) data gathered from our community advisory board (N=10), c) cognitive
interviews with SGM survivors (N=35), and d) a national online survey (N=1000), with quota sampling to ensure
adequate representation of cisgender, sexual minority men, cisgender, sexual minority women, and transgender/ otherwise
gender expansive people, purposively sampled to achieve maximum diversity in race and ethnicity. A community
advisory board with SGM GBV survivors, clinicians, scientific experts, and community stakeholders will be engaged
throughout the research process ensuring potential impact and sustainability. This study is innovative because it uses rich
community-engaged approaches to articulate help-seeking and recovery experiences at multiple levels, incorporating
SGM survivors at all stages of the process, with an emphasis on recovery rather than deficit. In turn, the instruments
created are expected to open new horizons in SGM survivorship research and practice, specifically the ability to
illuminate SGM recovery needs and prioritize interventions to mitigate drivers of SGM health disparities at multiple
levels of influence. Successful completion of this project is expected to have a positive impact by enhancing our ability to:
1) evaluate future help-seeking and recovery intervention effectiveness, 2) enhance help-seeking and recovery exploration
in SGM populations, and 3) determine how changes in policy influence help-seeking and recovery for SGM populations.
The study's key deliverables will include two instruments measuring help-seeking barriers and GBV recovery needs,
validated in SGM populations, using rigorous community-engaged qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods
approaches. These expected outcomes will support NIH priorities for Health Disparities Science by strengthening
measurement of help-seeking barriers and recovery in SGM survivors, thereby improving understanding on multi-level
areas for additional exploration to improve health disparities in these populations."
10989106,"The overall goals of this application are to harness the power of intein chemistry to invent useful technologies to study Ebola virus (EBOV), a deadly reemerging pathogen with case fatality rates of 40-90%. Inteins (intervening proteins) are translated within the context of other proteins and are removed through protein splicing. In this intein-mediated reaction, the two peptide bonds surrounding the intein are rearranged to release the intein from the flanking protein sequences, which are concurrently joined by a peptide bond. Because of this unique functionality, inteins have proven exceptionally useful in protein engineering. In one application, a heterologous protein can be inserted within an intein, with both the intein and the inserted protein retaining function. Leveraging this property, we recently developed an intein-based system for adding reporter genes to EBOV. In this self-removing reporter, a fluorescent protein is inserted within an intein, with the hybrid protein maintaining fluorescence and splicing capability. Importantly, the reporter does not remain fused to any viral protein or require an additional transcriptional unit, both which can disrupt viral growth. Recombinant EBOV containing this intein-based reporter displayed fluorescence and remained infectious, demonstrating in principle the validity of our reporter design. While a growth defect was observed for EBOV expressing this reporter, we found that serially passaged virus grew significantly better than the original recombinant virus. Excitingly, passaged virus had mutations that enhanced the catalytic properties of the intein itself. This proposal will both build upon recent discoveries as well as establish new lines of investigation into the use of inteins as tools to study viruses. Aim 1 will systematically evaluate the sequence and structural features of natural intein insertion sites, information that will be used to develop improved intein-based technologies for use in EBOV and other systems. Aim 1 will also develop additional intein-based reporters using our strategy of passaging recombinant EBOV. Intein-reporter fusions will be assessed by evaluating splicing efficiency, reporter activity, and viral protein function using E. coli and mammalian systems. Importantly, Aim 1 will directly compare our optimized intein-based reporters to traditional reporter virus approaches. As splicing must occur for intein-containing proteins to become active, Aim 2 will establish an intein-based “off-switch” that can be used to inactivate newly translated protein via inhibition of splicing. Using this strategy, a recombinant EBOV containing an off-switch within the transcriptional activator VP30 will be developed and used to investigate the role of VP30 during early viral replication. In principle, our innovative off-switch design could be extended to reversibly inactivate any newly translated protein. This work will establish new, widely applicable intein-based technologies that will be of immediate use for the study of EBOV mechanisms of pathogenesis. Further, as our strategy of passaging virus allows for the identification of intein variants with enhanced catalytic properties, our work will impact the broad community of researchers employing intein-based applications."
10990737,"Abstract:
Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease (ALD) continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.
Currently, there are no FDA-approved therapies that block or reverse ALD progression. Understanding the key
steps that promote ALD progression is essential to identifying new treatment targets and methods that alleviate
ALD. Prominent among the factors that contribute to ALD progression is the alcohol-induced disruption of
intestinal barrier integrity, accompanied by microbial flora imbalance (dysbiosis). Both these promote gut and
liver injury. However, the cellular/molecular mechanisms by which excessive drinking triggers dysbiosis and
compromises intestinal barrier integrity must be clearly established. Here, we present unique, exciting new data,
showing that chronic ethanol (EtOH) feeding disrupts intestinal autophagy, a crucial intracellular catabolic
process that begins with the formation of autophagosomes (AV), which sequester and deliver senescent
macromolecules and organelles to lysosomes for breakdown in this organelle. The degraded species are
replenished by synthesis. This process of rapid and constant turnover preserves the specialized functions of all
cells, but especially intestinal cells and it regulates intestinal microbial composition as well, thereby, maintaining
gut homeostasis. Our understanding of autophagy’s role in preserving intestinal barrier function has progressed
significantly, but we need a better understanding of how EtOH misuse disrupts gut autophagy to impair barrier
function. Our objective is to ascertain the mechanism(s) by which EtOH exposure dysregulates autophagy in
intestinal cells to compromise gut barrier integrity and promotes alcohol-induced liver injury. We propose the
following Specific Aims: Aim 1. Investigate how EtOH-induced lysosome disruption affects epithelial cell barrier
integrity; Aim 2) Clarify the effects of EtOH-induced autophagy disruption on Paneth cell function and Aim 3)
Ascertain how EtOH-induced liver injury is exacerbated by deficient intestinal autophagy but is alleviated by
autophagy reactivation in the gut."
10991203,"Problem: There is high unmet need for PrEP among cis-gender women in the U.S. Even where
resources are available to support PrEP, it remains inaccessible to women because too few
clinical settings provide it. Purpose: To support women’s choice, we will expand and enhance a
PrEP decision aid to include the full array of available formulation options and then integrate its
delivery into sexual and reproductive health (SRH) settings during contraceptive counseling
visits, where PrEP can be provided to all women who are interested. Methods: Project
Carmenta is guided by the Health Equity Implementation Framework, critical ongoing input from
our Community Advisory Board and the cumulative expertise of the study team in HIV
prevention, sexual and reproductive health, decision science, implementation science, and
family planning epidemiology. We will engage patients (n=15-20), clinicians (n=10), and staff
(n=10) at SRH clinics across Greater New Haven, CT for semi-structured interviews to expand
and enhance an existing PrEP decision aid to include all available formulations and optimize its
integration into SRH clinics. Qualitative interviews will inform infrastructure development to
support PrEP delivery in SRH clinics. In a hybrid Type 2 effectiveness-implementation study, we
will then randomize patients (n=50) to receive either the PrEP decision aid or generic PrEP
information prior to a clinician visit. In follow-up interviews immediately post-visit, and at Months
3 and 6, primary outcomes are clinical efficacy (PrEP initiation) and implementation (using
Proctor definitions for feasibility, acceptability, penetration, and adoption) that are important for
future planned scale-up. Aims: The Aims of the project are: 1) To expand and enhance an
existing decision aid on PrEP, and assess innovation, clinical encounter, recipients, and context-
level factors affecting its integration into contraceptive counseling visits in SRH clinics; and 2) To
integrate the expanded patient-facing individual PrEP decision aid into contraceptive counseling
visits and evaluate clinical and implementation outcomes. Significance: The proposed research
directly addresses the key objectives of RFA-MH-24-332 and priorities of the NIH Office of AIDS
Research by using a decision aid to support women’s choice of PrEP product and providing new
insights on how women weigh each option. Significance is high because integration of PrEP into
SRH reduces barriers to access for women. Innovation is high because of the use of a gender-
and trauma-responsive PrEP decision aid for women within a SRH setting. Public health impact
is high because of a focus on achieving health equity in a rapidly changing SRH landscape and
supporting women’s choice of PrEP."
10982789,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most commonly diagnosed developmental disorder of
childhood, affecting ~9% of children nationwide. Although ADHD dramatically increases the risk for poor
academic achievement, substance abuse, and criminal behavior, particularly in adolescence, too little is known
regarding how neurobiological developmental trajectories underlie these behavioral and clinical outcomes. This
remains the case in spite of the importance of such work for earlier identification of risk factors, more targeted
treatment models, and, in turn, education, juvenile justice, and healthcare savings for individuals, families, and
society. The goal of the parent grant, therefore, is to characterize longitudinal neural, behavioral, and clinical
trajectories of youth with ADHD from late childhood to mid-adolescence. Brain systems underlying cognitive
control and motivation in particular have been identified as centrally important both to the neural etiology of
ADHD and to the general increase in risk-taking behavior and poor decision-making observed in typically
developing (TD) adolescents. An important aspect of these models is how brain regions underlying these
processes form coherent networks, as well as how these networks interact and influence each other to produce
behavior. Here we bring together these two disparate literatures to gain understanding of the transition to
adolescence in youth with ADHD. Thus, the parent grant focuses on the maturational course of the cognitive
control and motivation systems, individually and in interaction, in youth with and without ADHD in a multi-session
longitudinal design. The specific aims of the parent grant include: 1) Characterize behavioral trajectories of
cognitive control, motivation, and their interaction in ADHD and TD youth from childhood into adolescence; 2)
Characterize the development of structural and functional brain network organization during the same time
period, focusing on brain networks underlying cognitive control and motivation; and 3) Identify neural, behavioral,
and clinical features of pre-adolescent ADHD that predict clinical outcomes and risk-taking behavior during
adolescence. To address these aims, innovative network analytic tools based on graph theory and structural
equation modeling will be applied to structural and functional connectivity estimates of MRI data during diffusion-
weighted imaging (structural) and during rest, cognitive control, motivation, and risk-taking tasks (functional).
Additionally behavioral performance on the cognitive control, motivation and risk-taking tasks, ADHD
symptomatology, and risk-taking attitudes and behavior will be assessed. The aim of this supplement is to
provide funds such that the acquisition of all planned MRI scanning can take place, given unanticipated costs in
collecting neuroimaging data as a result of: 1) increases in hourly rate; and 2) the need to schedule longer MRI
scan sessions in response to requirements of the imaging center. With this supplement, data collection can be
completed as proposed. Findings from this research will provide groundwork that can lead to early identification
and, ultimately, prevention of ADHD trajectories that are more likely to lead to adverse outcomes in adolescence."

and a community of potential users of the findings to drive health-protective and equitable climate solutions
forward. The Exposure Assessment Core will lead the Center’s efforts to make geospatial climate and
environmental data more accessible, interoperable, and interpretable for climate and health research
conducted by researchers from various disciplines."
10996940,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Substance use is one of the most commonly occurring health risk behaviors and has been unambiguously
linked to numerous negative outcomes (e.g., Stellern et al., 2023, Planell-Ripoll et al., 2019). These far-
reaching public health issues have impelled substantial growth in the theoretical conceptualizations of causal
processes of substance use, especially in theories of dynamic processes that unfold over time (e.g., Shiffman,
2009). However, the rapid growth in these theories has occurred before the empirical properties of statistical
methodologies used to test the theories have been fully vetted. Multilevel Modeling (MLM) and Dynamic
Structural Equation Modeling (DSEM) are widely used to examine dynamic theories of substance use, yet the
performance of these models under conditions common to theories of substance use is unknown. This directly
undermines the ability of substantive researchers to make informed choices about models. The integration of
theory and methods is essential to building reliable and valid theories of substance use.
MLM is a modeling framework commonly used to assess risk and protective processes of substance use. It
has several strengths including the ability to model unequal time intervals, the use of maximum likelihood
estimation, and the widespread availability of MLM in statistical programs. However, MLM is not well-suited to
model reciprocal relationships (Falkenström et al., 2022), which are hypothesized in many theories of
substance use. Reciprocal effects can be appropriately modeled in DSEM, and DSEM has other strengths
such as the ability to address measurement error and to introduce random effects across a variety of estimates
(Asparouhov et al., 2018). Yet, DSEM is not without limitations when applied to substance use theory. For
example, there is currently no way to systematically build and evaluate DSEM models, which has serious
implications for inference (Hamaker et al., 2018). Further, an assumption of DSEM that is often not met is that
measurements are equally spaced. Undoubtedly, there are conditions in which MLM and DSEM can
adequately and appropriately model dynamic processes of substance use. However, until these conditions are
comprehensively evaluated, we risk building a literature marked by biased results that lack internal validity.
The purpose of this proposed program of research and training is to improve researchers' ability to test novel
theories of substance use, such as the edge on, edge off theory. I aim to (1) generate data consistent with the
characteristics of theories from the substance use literature, (2) identify conditions under which MLM and
DSEM perform optimally and conditions under which they result in biased parameter estimates, and (3)
disseminate guidance for using these methodologies to substance use researchers and meaningfully
contribute to the substance use literature by examining the novel edge-on, edge-off theory. My proposed
project will fully integrate advanced substance use training and research with quantitative methodologies so

Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) is a rare, accelerated aging disease caused by a single point
mutation (SNP) in the LMNA gene. This mutation results in the production of an aberrant protein called progerin
which disrupts proper nuclear function within cells. Patients with HGPS die at an early age most often due to
complications from severe atherosclerosis. The progression of this atherosclerosis is not fully understood. Animal
models that exclusively express progerin in either vascular smooth muscle (vSMC) or endothelial (EC) cells still
exhibit thickening of the vessel adventitia despite no progerin-positive cells in this region. This suggests multiple
vascular cell types can influence the same pathological characteristics, possibly through paracrine signaling.
Having a better understanding of which cell types within the vasculature contribute most to the fibrosis,
calcification, and stiffening that occur during atherosclerosis would be useful in generating more effective,
targeted therapies. Treating HGPS has proven difficult, with only one therapy approved for clinical use. Other
treatment options have been effective in animal models but have shown only modest benefits in patients. A new
genetic engineering therapy using an adenine base editor (ABE) can correct the LMNA point mutation and
significantly improved survival in an HGPS mouse model. Understanding what level of mutation correction is
required in the vasculature to alleviate pathological features would aid in translating this new technology to the
clinic. The goal of this proposal is to use an in vitro human vascular model of HGPS to better understand the
influence of different vascular cells on the progression of HGPS-induced atherosclerosis and to estimate what
level of mutation correction would be needed to improve the vascular pathology. We hypothesize the adventitial
fibroblasts are the primary contributors to vascular fibrosis, calcification, and stiffening in HGPS, and that
mutation correction within these cells will effectively reduce these disease characteristics. To test this hypothesis,
we will generate a tissue-engineered blood vessel (TEBV) disease model using cells from HGPS patients. In
Aim 1, we will determine the relative contributions of fibroblasts, vSMCs, and ECs on HGPS vascular disease
by testing different combinations of progerin-expressing cells in the TEBV model and evaluating disease
progression. For Aim 2, we will treat HGPS TEBVs with different doses of ABE, delivered by adeno-associated
virus, and evaluate editing efficiency in each cell type and progression of atherosclerosis. When completed,
these aims will provide a more physiologically relevant human model of HGPS vascular disease for testing new
treatments. Additionally, they will improve our understanding of how different vascular cells contribute to HGPS
disease progression and to what extent correcting the LMNA mutation within these cells will abate or reverse
atherosclerosis. Broadly, this work will also show the utility of using human microphysiological systems to model
disease and test the efficacy of new therapeutics."

Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease affecting nearly one million
people in the United States, and up to 80% of PD patients eventually develop Parkinson’s Disease Dementia
(PDD), many with co-Alzheimer’s Disease pathology. PD is a neurodegenerative disease impacting the
dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), which play a large role in controlling both
movement and cognition. The motor circuit involves the lateral SNpc projections to the striatum, while dementia
phenotypes involve the medial SNpc projections to various cortical and limbic related structures. To date, there
are no significant therapeutics that prevent progression of disease and dementia, highlighting a critical need for
further understanding of PD pathology. Notably, epigenetics has gained prominence, with histone deacetylase
inhibitors showing promise for neurodegenerative diseases, including PD. Recently, H3K4me3, trimethylated
histone 3 at lysine 4, has come to light as a neuroprotector in a drug induced rat model of PD. This proposal
aims to interrogate a novel epigenetic marker, dopaminylation, in PD. Our lab recently established a novel role
for dopamine termed dopaminylation, whereby dopamine acts as an epigenetic marker on Histone 3 glutamine
5 (H3Q5dop), adjacent to the significant H3K4me3 modification. H3Q5dop is covalently attached via the Tissue-
Transglutaminase 2 enzyme to proteins and this process is concentration dependent. Given the loss of dopamine
in PD, there is indeed an observed loss of H3Q5dop in postmortem human PD SNpc tissue and a global loss of
dopaminylation observed in postmortem human PD post-synaptic BA25 cortical tissue. Interestingly, the loss of
H3Q5dop was found in conjunction with and independent of the neighboring H3K4me3 epigenetic modification.
Preliminary findings suggest that H3Q5dop plays an important role in preserving and potentiating H3K4me3
readout, possibly pointing to H3Q5dop’s role in neuroprotection as well. Thus, I hypothesize that H3Q5dop
influences chromatin architecture via enhancing H3K4me3 signal, and its decrease in PD alters cellular
identity, SNpc projections to key motor and cognitive brain regions, and behavior. Firstly, this proposal will
interrogate H3Q5dop in human postmortem SNpc and BA25 prefrontal cortex via the integration of data from
epigenetic regulation, chromatin accessibility, and gene expression. Secondly, in mouse models, this proposal
will assess the loss of H3Q5dop mediated changes to transcriptional identity, SNpc projections, motor function,
and emotion-based learning. This innovative work will offer novel insights into H3Q5dop’s role in the
pathophysiology of PD, establishing a novel therapeutic target. This proposed research will take place at the
Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, within the Friedman Brain Institute, one of the world’s premier
institutions for translational brain and nervous system sciences. With hopes of becoming a leading physician
neuroscientist, working towards the proposed training goals will equip me with essential skills in molecular,
behavioral, and computational research while advancing my medical training."
10997054,"PROPOSAL SUMMARY-ABSTRACT
Adolescent suicide is a growing public health problem and a leading cause of death in the US. Rates of
adolescent suicide and suicidal behavior have been on the rise for the last two decades increasing
disproportionally among Black adolescents. Increasing rates of suicidal behaviors have also led to a surge in
adolescent ED visits. Parents play a central role in suicide prevention efforts by protecting their children from
self-harm and promoting their mental health following discharge from the ED for suicidal behavior (SB) when a
child’s risk for recurrent SB is greatest. Parents’ needs in caring for suicidal adolescents are often not
considered yet they hold primary responsibility for ensuring their child’s safety after ED discharge. Parental
self-efficacy (PSE) is a parent’s belief in their ability to fulfill their parenting role effectively and is a powerful
predictor of parenting competence and child well-being. In the context of this study, PSE to prevent SB is
conceptualized as a parent’s perceived ability to support their child in crisis, keep them safe, and prevent future
SB. This convergent mixed-methods study seeks to understand the psychosocial factors associated with SB
prevention self-efficacy among parents caring for adolescents following an ED visit for SB by addressing the
following specific aims: 1) Examine associations between parent-level psychosocial factors, adolescent
suicide-related characteristics, and parents’ SB prevention self-efficacy, 2) Based on individual parent
interviews, understand how psychosocial and contextual factors influence parents’ SB prevention self-efficacy
with an emphasis on understanding potential differences in the experiences of Black parents; and 3)
Integrating results from Aims 1 and 2, identify potential strategies for building parents’ SB prevention self-
efficacy in caring for an adolescent following an ED visit for SB. The study will be guided by a parent advisory
group and leverage the research infrastructure of a larger PCORI-funded adolescent suicide prevention study
in the Johns Hopkins Hospital Pediatric ED. Aim 1 (quantitative) will use cross-sectional data (n=125; 60%
Black/African American); Aim 2 (qualitative) will include individual interviews (sub-sample of parents n=20;
50% Black/African American). Correlations and multiple linear regression models will be used to test the
quantitative data; a content analysis approach will be used to analyze the qualitative data. Data from Aims 1
and 2 will be integrated to compare parents’ qualitative descriptions and quantitative scores and assess for
potential differences in parents’ SB prevention self-efficacy based on parent-level psychosocial factors,
adolescent suicide-related characteristics, and between Black/African American and White parents. Results of
this study will fill a clinical research gap with the future goal of developing interventions to bolster the protective
role of parents in preventing adolescent SB. The proposed study addresses the NIMH’s Strategic Plan,
Strategic Framework for Addressing Youth Mental Health Disparities, and recent calls to identify risk and
protective factors for youth suicide and prevention."
10997294,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There is evidence of a growing health disparity in mental health—particularly rising depression and
anxiety—in Latinx young adults. Fear of deportation is prevalent in this population, with nearly 39% of
Latinxs expressing concern about the possibility of themselves or someone they know being deported. Fear of
deportation has been linked to high levels of anxiety and depression among Latinx populations, yet little is
known about the underlying mechanisms driving this relation. While there is a growing number of studies
investigating systemic inflammation among Latinx populations, there remains a knowledge gap related to the
associations between inflammation and structural racism. The proposed project aims to expand health
disparity and discrimination research among Latinx immigrant young adults by examining how
systemic inflammation may mediate the relation between fear of deportation and depression and
anxiety. Specifically, the study will recruit 150 Latinx college students with temporary or no legal status and
150 Latinx students with permanent legal status to complete online questionnaires and provide a saliva
sample. The first aim of the proposed project is to assess the multi-domain effects of fear of deportation on
systemic inflammation (biological domain) and mental health outcomes (behavioral domain). It is hypothesized
that systemic inflammation will mediate the relations of fear of deportation with anxiety and depression. The
second aim of the proposed project is to identify multi-level risk factors that moderate the associations between
fear of deportation, systemic inflammation, and the mental health outcomes of anxiety and depression. The
study hypothesizes that acculturation (individual level), discrimination (community level), and skin color
(individual level) will act as moderators of links between fear of deportation, inflammation, and mental health.
Additionally, the third aim of the proposed project is to identify multi-level protective factors that may weaken
these links. It is hypothesized that political activism (individual level), parent-child attachment (interpersonal
level), and religiosity (community level) will mitigate the associations between fear of deportation, systemic
inflammation, and depression and anxiety. The proposal innovates by considering, for the first time, risk and
protective factors across domains and levels of influence that are operating at the biological level to exacerbate
and mitigate the effects of deportation stress on mental health. Additionally, it aims to shed light on the
influence of structural racism on health through biological processes. The findings of this study can inform the
development of targeted interventions and policies aimed at reducing a known health disparity and promoting
resilience among minoritized populations. As such, this study is aligned with NIMHD's strategic goal of
investigating the health determinants that underlie resilience or susceptibility to diseases and conditions
experienced by minority populations. It will also support the training of a first-generation, Latina immigrant who
seeks to address health disparities through doctoral study and an independent research career in psychology."

Our proposed project is designed to investigate the immunopathological basis of NK cell-mediated pancreatic
insufficiency which may lead to the future occurrence of diabetes mellitus (DM) among people living with HIV
(PLWH). Furthermore, we plan to explore HIV/antiretroviral therapy-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress
as a contributory pathophysiological phenomenon which would render pancreatic tissue more susceptible to
immune-mediated destruction in this population, with attempts to mitigate this through low-cost, ER stress-
inhibiting medication. Our comprehensive analysis of the altered immunophenotype among PLWH has revealed
several subsets of activated, pro-inflammatory NK cells dominating the circulation. We have also successfully
demonstrated direct effects of these altered NK cells among PLWH in contributing to the ongoing risk of other
non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease at a very young age. Based on
our previous research findings and existing literature, we have gathered sufficient evidence to back our proposed
studies. Our epidemiological findings have collectively predicted an increased risk of DM in an expanding HIV
population dominated by young adults in Sri Lanka, a lower-middle income country (LMIC) in South Asia, which
relies heavily on an active workforce for sustenance of its fragile economy. We strongly believe that our proposed
work and its main outcomes may broaden our understanding of the NK cell-mediated immunopathogenesis of
such NCDs and socioeconomically acceptable therapeutic/preventive strategies which could be implemented in
these critical populations in the future. We also believe that our exploratory study would create a significant
impact and ignite further research in this field of study. By conducting this project in an LMIC setting like Sri
Lanka, we hope to foster a network of research collaborations between two diverse settings, with plans to
strengthen the research infrastructure related to HIV and its comorbidities in Sri Lanka. Through our proposed
scientific techniques such as high-dimensional flow cytometry, novel immunohistochemical techniques,
transcriptomics and epigenomics, we hope to carryout exchange of knowledge and expertise and between our
study settings and help build necessary infrastructure in Sri Lanka in an effort to lay the groundwork for future
collaborations on HIV related research in this setting."
10999215,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Temporomandibular jaw joint osteoarthritis (TMJ OA) and other disorders of the TMJ affect up to 12% of the US
population. OA in general is the leading cause of disability in the US and is characterized by the deterioration of
the superficial cartilage lining the joints. A contributor to the high incidence of TMJ OA is the fact that humans
are unable to regenerate the specialized superficial cartilage of joints. Current treatments are limited to
minimizing pain instead of restoring natural joint structure and function. The Crump lab has recently shown that
adult zebrafish can regenerate the superficial cartilage of the synovial jaw joint after injury. This model relies on
transecting a major ligament supporting the jaw, which results in joint degeneration in the short term and full
regeneration of the superficial cartilage lining the jaw joint after the ligament heals. The limitations of this surgical
model are that it is labor-intensive, low-throughput, and highly variable. Using an f13a1b enhancer which we
discovered drives highly specific activity in superficial cartilage of the jaw and other neural crest-derived joints, I
have generated transgenic lines to specifically ablate joint cartilage. Using this ablation model, I have found that
jaw joint superficial cartilage regeneration is highly reproducible, and this will allow me to investigate the source
of new cartilage cells. For this proposal, I plan to optimize the transgenic model for joint cartilage ablation, and
then investigate the sources of the regenerating cartilage. To do so, I have identified through single-nuclei
chromatin accessibility studies several cell type-specific enhancers that will allow me to mark and lineage trace
putative progenitors during joint regeneration. Three potential sources of regenerated joint chondrocytes will be
investigated: 1) The perichondrium surrounding the jaw joint could house progenitor cells that move into the joint
upon ablation and form new superficial chondrocytes. 2) Deeper chondrocytes at the joint, which share properties
with growth plate chondrocytes, could transdifferentiate into superficial chondrocytes following ablation. 3) Rare
superficial chondrocytes that escape ablation could proliferate and repopulate the joint surface. Using newly
identified cell type-specific enhancers, I will create CreERT transgenic lines to trace the contributions of each
population during jaw joint cartilage regeneration. In parallel, I will carry out a single-cell multiomic analysis of
the regenerating jaw joint to discover in an unbiased way potential progenitor cells activated by injury that may
mediate repair. By identifying the source of jaw joint cartilage regeneration in zebrafish, I will be poised to further
explore the molecular basis by which zebrafish can regenerate their joint tissues. In the future, we hope to
uncover whether similar populations exist in the human TMJ that can be activated to counteract OA."

Adolescent dating violence (ADV) is highly prevalent among girls in the US and can have devastating
consequences for mental health, including increased risk for depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. As
such, there is a critical need for effective depression and suicide prevention strategies for ADV girl survivors.
Restorative justice (RJ) is one policy-based justice and accountability response to ADV that has the potential to
improve youth mental health disparities among ADV girl survivors. RJ allows survivors to narrate their ADV
stories and offer perpetrators an opportunity to acknowledge and remedy the harm, and engage in
rehabilitation, which supports survivor preferences and fosters healing. To our knowledge, no study has
examined whether state-level RJ policies and their implementation impact depressive symptoms or suicidal
ideation among ADV girl survivors over time and whether impacts differ by race or ethnicity. The proposed
fellowship builds on the applicant's prior background to prepare her for a career as an independent mixed
methods researcher and behavioral scientist with expertise in structural- and community-level prevention
intervention efforts for gender-based violence and its mental health consequences. The specific fellowship
goals are to: 1) deepen health policy methods and advanced multilevel and causal quantitative analysis skills,
2) develop and strengthen intersectional mixed methods skills in public health, and 3) refine academic writing
and communication skills. These goals will be accomplished through coursework and workshops, mentorship
from the sponsor team, and execution of the proposed research project including dissemination of study
findings. The specific aims of this proposed research are to: 1) examine associations between state RJ policies
with depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation among ADV girl survivors, and test the effect modification of
race/ethnicity (N=82,400), 2) among states with a RJ policy, examine associations between policy
implementation with depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation among ADV girl survivors, and test effect
modification of race/ethnicity (N=41,200), and 3) qualitatively describe perceptions of mental health and
preferences for justice and accountability among ADV girl survivors (N=30). The proposed research uses a
sequential explanatory mixed methods (QUANT -> QUAL) approach in a two-part research project. Aims 1
and 2 leverage 4 waves of population-representative data in 48 states from the 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2019
waves of the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBS) and data on RJ policies specific to adolescents
from a RJ legislative database. Aim 3 uses semi-structured interviews conducted with 10 white, 10 Black and
10 Hispanic ADV girl survivors to contextualize quantitative findings and identify ways to improve and tailor the
justice response for ADV girl survivors. This proposal aligns with NIMH's youth mental health disparities call by
examining how state policies impact mental health outcomes using longitudinal data, which has the potential to
inform the mental health equity and enhancement of justice practices for ADV girl survivors."
10997541,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Each of the 4-5 quick eye movements (saccades) that we generate every second is the result of a target
selection process that combines perceptual and motor planning signals modulated by attention mechanisms,
which prioritize the potential targets. The overarching goal of this project is to reveal how these attention
mechanisms are instantiated in the activity of the frontal eye field (FEF), a key oculomotor area. Specifically, I
propose to record neuronal activity from recognized neuronal types in FEF while monkeys perform two novel
visuomotor tasks. Many studies have investigated how oculomotor neurons contribute to visuomotor choices.
However, most have relied on serialized tasks where a perceptual judgment is made first and a motor report is
made subsequently, and given this structure, the resulting behavioral metrics (accuracy and RT) confound the
contributions of perceptual, motor, and attentional processes to each choice. An effective solution to this
limitation is to impose urgency which, in essence, means that motor plans are always initiated first, before the
task-relevant sensory cue is evaluated. Time pressure yields a novel psychophysical curve, the “tachometric
curve”, which is unique in its ability to resolve the contributions of distinct perceptual signals to the saccadic
choice process as it unfolds in time. Each of my two Specific Aims implements a novel, urgent decision-making
paradigm. In both cases the general strategy is to record FEF activity and, using the time-resolved behavioral
information provided by the tachometric curve, compare the neuronal responses evoked before and after
perceptual information arrives to the circuit. In Aim 1, I plan to use an urgent version of the classic random dot
motion (RDM) discrimination task to determine whether the spatially selective activity in FEF represents the
location where attention is deployed or, alternatively, the amount of sensory evidence that has accumulated in
favor of a choice toward that location. These two functions, attentional deployment and evidence accumulation,
represent entirely distinct theoretical constructs — but are readily confounded in standard, non-urgent tasks.
The proposed dissociation would represent a key conceptual advance. In Aim 2, I plan to use SpotChase, a
gamified, dynamic urgent task, to investigate how visuomotor performance depends on selection history
effects. It is now well established that visuomotor choices are determined not only by ongoing stimulus-driven
and goal-driven signals, but also by past events (stimuli, actions, rewards, etc.) recently experienced.
However, the impact of such selection histories is likely to be much stronger under natural viewing conditions
than in trial-based laboratory tasks. Because SpotChase is highly dynamic but still permits rigorous behavioral
quantification (specifically, construction of tachometric curves), it will afford a much more comprehensive
characterization of the neural basis of selection history effects under more relevant behavioral conditions.
Preliminary data promise significant advances in both Aims."
10999561,"Project Summary
Decades of genetic and experimental evidence has placed α-synuclein (αS) as a central player in the
pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson’s Disease (PD), Alzheimer’s Disease
(AD) and related dementias (ADRD). αS protein levels closely correlate with PD and ADRD risk, and reduction
has been shown to be protective in multiple disease models, making lowering αS levels a target for therapeutic
intervention. Despite that, there is very poor understanding of how the abundance and turnover of endogenous
αS protein is regulated. We recently found, using unbiased CRISPR screens in human cell lines and iPSC-
derived neurons, that disruption of the NatB complex resulted in a stark reduction in endogenous protein levels
and is well tolerated in human iPSC derived neurons. NatB installs N-terminal acetylation (AcN) of αS.
While AcN is a prevalent post-translational modification, its functional consequences are not well understood.
AcN has been implicated in several processes specific to αS, such as membrane binding, cell uptake, and
aggregation. Indeed, our own preliminary data support the importance of these effects and more. These results
led us to hypothesize that lack of αS AcN compromises interactions that are fundamental to its molecular
function and that pharmacological targeting of AcN represents a novel therapeutic strategy for αS’s
involvement in PD and ADRDs.
 We propose three aims that will rigorously investigate the implications of these findings on αS biology
and therapeutics. In Aim 1, we will identify the molecular interactions that are lost when αS lacks AcN. We
believe that this will provide critical insight into its biological function. We will also investigate the mechanisms
responsible for the rapid degradation of non-AcN αS compared to AcN αS. This may provide additional tools
for therapeutic reduction of pathological αS in disease and insight into αS turnover mechanisms. In Aim 2, we
will focus on understanding the outcome of NatB inhibition on the proteome and N-terminal acetylome of
human cells and neurons using quantitative proteomics approaches. Such understanding will be essential for
the development of NatB as a therapeutic target. Lastly, in Aim 3 we will develop the first NatB
pharmacological inhibitors for evaluation in vitro, and in iPSC derived neurons. We use state-of-the-art
computational approaches in combination with experimental high-throughput screening to identify molecules
that can inhibit NatB acetylation of αS with minimal effects on AcN of other proteins. These molecules will
serve as essential research tools and as lead therapeutic candidates for PD and ADRDs."

Aspergillus fumigatus is a major human fungal pathogen capable of causing a range of diseases, including
invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and disseminated aspergillosis in a wide variety of immunocompromised
individuals, including organ transplant recipients and cancer patients. Mortality rates are as high as 40-50% in
these patients and direct healthcare costs associated with invasive aspergillosis, $4.6 billion in the U.S., are
more than those of any other fungal infection. A. fumigatus, normally found in the soil and environment,
produces asexual conidia that are typically inhaled in the lungs. Under appropriate host environmental
conditions conidia will germinate and eventually form hyphae that can not only penetrate lung tissue but also
establish a disseminated bloodstream infection. Conidial germination is thus critical for A. fumigatus virulence
and pathogenesis. While a variety of post-translational and transcriptional regulators are known to play
important roles in conidial germination, very little, if anything, is known about translational mechanisms.
However, multiple lines of evidence suggest that translational regulation plays an important role, including the
demonstration that conidial germination can be abrogated by inhibitors of translation, but not RNA or DNA
synthesis, that dormant conidia harbor a significant number of stored transcripts, which are primed for rapid
translation and activation, and that translation is one of the earliest detectable events in germinating conidia. In
addition, a comparative proteomic and transcriptomic study indicated that many genes show significant
differences in transcript vs. protein expression changes during A. fumigatus conidial germination and
transcripts of several key regulators of this process possess unusually long 5’ UTR regions, which have been
associated with translational regulation of morphology and other virulence processes in the human fungal
pathogen Candida albicans. We have also recently used ribosome profiling to demonstrate that the C. albicans
yeast-hyphal morphological transition, which is similar to A. fumigatus germination/polarized growth, is under
widespread global translational regulation that does not simply parallel transcriptional regulation; many genes
associated with virulence and virulence-related processes show altered translational efficiency. Based on this
evidence, we hypothesize that translational mechanisms play an important role in controlling A. fumigatus
conidial germination, distinct from that of transcriptional mechanisms, which will reveal novel potential
antifungal targets. In order to test this hypothesis, we will: 1) determine the global translational profile of A.
fumigatus during conidial germination, 2) identify and characterize translational mechanisms important for A.
fumigatus conidial germination. Ultimately, this study will provide a better understanding of global regulatory
circuits and pathways controlling A. fumigatus conidial germination at the translational level. This study will also
identify and characterize several key translationally regulated factors important for A. fumigatus conidial
germination that could potentially serve as targets for novel and more effective antifungals."

 The tree shrew shares many advantages with rodents for biomedical research, such as small body size,
short reproductive cycle, and low maintenance cost. Importantly, it is phylogenetically closer to primates than
rodents, and exhibits a more developed visual system and higher cognitive capabilities. These unique
characteristics have led to a growing interest among biomedical researchers in using tree shrews as a model
organism. With the support of an R13 grant from the NEI, two meetings were recently held to bring together the
community of established and new investigators who use tree shrews in their studies, with a focus on visual
neuroscience. These meetings have helped scientific and technical exchange and have started to build a
collaborative community of tree shrew researchers. Here the PIs propose to build on this momentum and
establish a regular Tree Shrew Discovery conference, taking place once every two years. In each of these
meetings, the organizers aim to achieve the following goals: (1) to share the latest scientific discoveries and
novel technical developments; (2) to facilitate the training of diverse predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees, as
well as independent scientists who are new to tree shrew research; and (3) to continue building a collaborative
scientific community among tree shrew researchers. These meetings will allow for efficient exchange around
topics including species characteristics, breeding and rearing, experimental procedures and techniques, and
development of viral and genetic tools. Given the many advantages it offers for biomedical research, the tree
shrew model will continue to play an important and expanding role in addressing fundamental neuroscientific
questions. To vision sciences in particular, tree shrew research will help advance our understanding of visual
system function and development, ultimately leading to therapeutic solutions for myopia, glaucoma, amblyopia,
as well as other visual disorders."

The 2024 AUA ECIW will be held November 8-9, 2024, at the AUA Headquarters in Linthicum, Maryland. The
workshop will provide intense, individualized instruction for a group of approximately thirty early-career
investigators and late-stage trainees on how to prepare innovative and competitive research grant applications,
primarily to the NIH with emphasis on grants in benign urology. Researchers, both faculty mentors and
attendees, will be MDs and PhDs from diverse perspectives and backgrounds. The program provides dual-
track instruction (early and advanced) by NIH-funded senior scientists. This workshop serves as a catalyst to
increase the quality of urologic research grant proposals submitted to the NIH.
The Principal Investigator (PI), Christine Riordan, PhD, LCSW-C, is AUA Director of Research. The Steering
Committee consists of a wide array of leaders in urologic research and research training. All faculty possess
exemplary records in NIH research funding, mentoring trainees, and planning urology research education.
This workshop consists of three parts: 1) two months of remote mentorship during which faculty mentors
provide feedback on specific aims and grant applications, 2) a Pre-Workshop webinar for funding mechanism
speakers to present applicable grants from their respective institutions, and 3) a 1.5-day in-person workshop.
The workshop includes presentations on key facets of grant writing and professional development including:
Crafting strong Specific Aims; composing successful research proposals; effective NIH biosketches; common
grant writing pitfalls; transitioning from K to R grants; starting an independently funded lab as junior faculty; lab
management, project management, and budgeting; creating strong mentor relationships; and social networks.
Mentors are matched to participants based on scientific area to customize feedback on methodologies. By
requiring faculty mentors and participants to meet over the course of two to three months, the participants can
improve their specific aims and grant applications under the tutelage of experienced researchers. The highlight
of the workshop is the Mock Peer Review Study Section where faculty mentors participate in a NIH-style Study
Section to demonstrate how grants are reviewed and how to avoid common errors.
The Advanced Grant Development track provides support to investigators submitting K- or R-type grant
applications within nine months after the workshop and is the target for evaluating the impact of the ECIW.
According to a recent outcomes analysis, those who participated in this track between 2015 and 2021 have
gone on to earn over $10 million in major grant funding from the NIH, DoD, and other organizations."
11000435,"Project Summary/Abstract: The United States has invested significant resources through innovative research to address
the profound effects of Alzheimer’s Disease, and Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) on families and
society, but Black men historically have not experienced the full benefits of scientific advances from that research. For
example, non-Hispanic Black men have diminished health and increased morbidity due to preventable diseases (e.g.,
cardiac, diabetes, high blood pressure) and shorter life expectancies than their White male counterparts Additionally, elderly
Black men are more likely to fall and sustain a TBI than whites, which increases the subsequent vulnerability of brain health
and risk of dementia. Similarly, Black American men might be at increased risk for later-life neurological disorders
associated with exposure to brain injury from contact sports participation, military service, and other sources. Although the
prevalence of AD/ADRD in Black Americans is two to three times higher than in non-Latinx White Americans, a complete
understanding of the causes of this profound health inequality remains elusive. The lack of a highly trained, multidisciplinary
scientific workforce that addresses the full range of biological, biomedical, behavioral, and health sciences approaches to
AD/ADRD health inequities research hinders innovation among this population. This problem is compounded by the
persistent under-representation of Black American males in biomedical research. During this five-year renewal conference
series, leading multidisciplinary national and international scholars will come together with emerging investigators to
address specific cultural, social, and behavioral factors that contribute to some individuals in this population being more
cognitively resilient and experience a reduced risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease than others. Scholars will enhance
the NIA Health Disparities Research Framework (HDRF) with the inclusion of empirically based factors that are responsive
to the Black male experience, as well as focus on efforts to improve recruitment and retention strategies for participation
from this population in aging research. An essential feature of the conference series will be to engage community
stakeholders (e.g., NFL Alumni Association, Global Sports Institute, Black Men’s Health Clinic, Beloved Community
Services Corporation) in multiple aspects of the conference design, planning, and implementation including the selection of
scientists and clinicians, providing feedback on conference presentations, and dissemination. Planning, implementation,
participation, and evaluation of the conference will incorporate individuals from historically underrepresented groups.
The
aims of the renewal conference series are: (1) Host five multidisciplinary conferences that address knowledge gaps, and
identify future priorities in inclusion science, AD/ADRC clinical trials, cognitive reserve/resilience, aging, and AD/ADRDs
health inequalities life course research among Black men; (2) Train a culturally competent workforce that can advance the
science and practice of lifespan brain health optimization for Black men, and to stimulate new life course research focused
on brain health, cognitive aging, and AD/ADRDs among Black men; and (3) Focused and collaborative attention to the
increased representation of Black men in biomedical research. These initiatives align with the goals of the NIA Division of
Behavioral Health and Society Research (BSR), to achieve health equity, and improve the health of all groups."

held in the United States. The meeting will be held over 2 days with multiple opportunities for oral and
poster presentations including new investigators. Prizes will be awarded for the best oral and poster
presentations by trainees. There will be breakout sessions designed to foster collaboration between
experienced researchers and new investigators along with clinicians and patients. Attendees and
presenters will be able to apply for travel support and recipients will be chosen by the ICHG Scientific
Committee based on their expressed need, contribution(s) to the meeting, trainee/new investigator
status, identification as a member of an underrepresented minority, and/or individual with a disability
or residence in a developing country. ICHG historically has a high representation of women as both
speakers and attendees (>50% speakers, >75% attendees). Minority representation has been low, so we

 Sterols lipids, including cholesterol, are important for mammalian cell physiology. These molecules
modulate the fluidity of biological membranes and are therefore implicated maintaining membrane integrity,
stress tolerance, fusion events, etc. Sterols are also involved in intra- and intercellular signaling and are trafficked
to sub-cellular membranes. Whereas decades of research have provided molecular insights into eukaryotic sterol
synthesis, transport, regulation, and function, similar understanding of sterols is lacking for bacteria and archaea.
While it is thought that archaea do not make or use sterols, some bacteria do make and transport sterols; many
others are known to engage with sterols produced by eukaryotes. These bacteria include the pathogenic
spirochetes (Borrelia burgdorferi, Treponema pallidum), Mycobacteria, Chlamydia, Rickettsia, and gut
microbiota. For pathogens, the acquisition of sterols from the host is critical as they colonize and construct their
cell envelopes. For gut microbes, interactions with cholesterol can alter the host lipid metabolism, thereby
contributing to cardiometabolic diseases and dyslipidemia. Despite the preponderance of research about
microbial interactions with these lipids, lacking are molecular insights into how the interactions occur and how
they are regulated. We will address this knowledge gap, which we posit will reveal novel targets for therapeutic
interventions in bacterial colonization and aberrant sterol lipid metabolism.
 Given that some bacteria produce sterols de novo, we reasoned that achieving an understanding of sterol
handling in bacteria that make them could reveal insights into their handling in bacteria that use them. We
therefore focused on Methylcoccus capsulatus, a bacterium reported to produce sterols nearly 40 years ago.
Recent studies reported a significant divergence in sterol biosynthesis in M. capsulatus. We have since added
to those reports one showing that sterol trafficking is also substantially different. We identified three proteins that
traffic sterols: BstA, BstB, and BstC. BstA is a member of the resistance nodulation division family of transporters
that work as transporters for a wide range of bacterial metabolites. BstB is a periplasmic binding protein with
homologs involved in phosphonate transport. Finally, BstC is an outer membrane associated lipoprotein
belonging to a family of transporters whose substrates are not known. The overall structures of the Bst proteins
are markedly different from eukaryotic sterol transporters. However, they all contain ligand sites that are similar
in the presentation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues. We posit that a modified structural genomics
approach wherein the focus is on ligand sites instead of overall structure/sequence would enable the
identification of functionally homologous proteins in bacteria. This work will use bioinformatics, quantitative ligand
binding analyses, and structural approaches to identify and characterize sterol trafficking proteins in bacteria that
make sterols, pathogens that hijack sterols, and gut flora that modulate host sterol metabolism."

The exposed epithelial surfaces of the body, including the skin, gut, female reproductive tract, and airways, are
colonized by microorganisms that contribute to homeostasis and disease. While the resident microbiota has
been extensively characterized in many of these sites, the ocular surface microbiome is relatively
understudied. The use of metagenomic sequencing approaches has facilitated moving beyond targeted
culturing approaches to more fully characterize the breadth of organisms present in a specimen. However, the
relative microbial biomass at the ocular surface is much lower than other mucosal surfaces, such as the gut.
Metagenomic characterization of low microbial biomass specimens presents numerous challenges, as sources
of contamination not only arise during the sampling procedure and from the environment itself, but even from
laboratory processing methods. As a result, the lack of protocol standardization and omission of key controls
for sources of contamination limits the interpretation and potential for comparison across studies. To address
these challenges, we have assembled a large multidisciplinary team of experts in topics including (i)
development of standardized protocols and clinical validation of diagnostic tests utilizing metagenomic
sequencing for low biomass biospecimens, (ii) development of open source metagenome analysis tools, (iii)
clinical assessment of ocular surface and external eye findings among a large, diverse patient population, and
(iv) wet lab characterization of microbes under strict cleanliness guidelines. We previously described the use of
metagenomic sequencing to detect the presence of pathogens in biopsies from the brain, paraffin embedded
ocular tissue specimens, and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). By comparing a range of specimen pre-treatment and
processing approaches and sophisticated software tools, we were able to optimize the methods to maximize
organism detection and minimize or remove contamination. We validated our metagenomic sequencing and
analytical approaches to the rigor required for use as a diagnostic test. Here, we hypothesize that following
similar approaches with low microbial biomass ocular specimens will facilitate the characterization of the
healthy ocular surface microbiome. In Aim 1, we will compare specimen processing approaches and validate
our analytical methods. In Aim 2, we will compare specimen collection approaches, including collection
materials and procedures. We will then use our optimized specimen collection and processing approaches to
collect ocular specimens longitudinally for characterization of organism persistence. In Aim 3, we will identify a
subset of participants with persistent and/or unique organisms to collect additional specimens for validation of
composition and characterization of viability. Upon study completion, we will have contributed to the
characterization and understanding of the healthy ocular surface microbiome, and developed protocols,
analytical tools, and datasets that will be made publicly available."

African American (AA) older adults have a greater risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and related
dementias (ADRD) when compared to non-Hispanic White older adults, which increases the number of
caregivers for this racial group. AA caregivers are predominantly daughters of AA persons living with ADRD
(AA PLWDs). These adult daughters and their families must navigate formal care decisions for their AA
PLWDs, which have associated health disparities. These health disparities result in AA PLWDs experiencing
greater morbidity and worse quality of life. There are no structured programs specifically aimed at guiding AA
parent-adult daughter dementia dyads’ and families’ formal care decision-making processes for AA PLWDs,
and AA caregivers tend to exhaust informal caregiving sources before using formal care. My preliminary
research focused on AA dementia dyads (i.e., AA PLWDs and their AA caregivers) found that AA non-spouse
(primarily adult daughters) dementia dyads both experienced worse quality of life than both members of AA
spouse caregiver dementia dyads, supporting our focus on AA adult daughter caregivers. In addition, AA
caregivers identified a lack of cultural tailoring of formal care as a barrier for use by AA PLWDs and desired
more family involvement when making formal care decisions for AA PLWDs. Aligned with the National Institute
on Aging’s Behavioral and Social Science high-priority dementia caregiver research, the K23 award aims are
to: 1) examine the influences (i.e., behavioral, sociocultural, and environmental) on the formal care decision-
making process and the quality of life of AA PLWDs and their AA adult daughter caregivers, 2) describe the
decision-making processes of members of AA parent-adult daughter dementia dyads that affect current and
future formal care use for AA PLWDs and explore how these processes influence the quality of life of both
members of these dyads, and 3) design and test the feasibility of a prototype intervention for AA parent-adult
daughter dementia dyads and families to enable them to develop tailored strategies to support the formal care
decision-making process for AA PLWDs. Building on my training as a clinician with expertise in ADRD
caregiving, I will: 1) develop expertise in multidisciplinary decision-making models that can be adapted to
conduct culturally-relevant research within AA dementia dyads and families, 2) acquire skills in analyzing
quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods dyadic data for intervention development, and 3) obtain expertise
using intervention mapping and design thinking for the development, implementation, and evaluation of
intervention studies. I have assembled an excellent team of mentors (Drs. Hepburn, Powell, and Lyons) and
consultants (Drs. Whitlatch, Dunbar, Higgins, and Yeager). The K23 award will provide me with the necessary
foundation to become an independent nurse scientist dedicated to improving the quality of life of AA dementia
dyads and families, which ideally aligns with NIA’s mission to “understand health disparities and develop
strategies to improve the health status of older adults in diverse populations.”"

11002123,"ABSTRACT
The proteostasis network relies on numerous feedback mechanisms to strike a balance between the rates of
protein synthesis and degradation, which is crucial for the maintenance of protein homeostasis. Proper tuning of
the rate of protein synthesis is also critical for the fidelity of cotranslational protein folding, which requires
coordination between the ribosome and various molecular chaperones. This translational regulation is especially
important for the fidelity of membrane protein (MP) biosynthesis, as the disruption of translational dynamics
appears to coincide with cotranslational misfolding and premature degradation. Nevertheless, it is currently
unclear how the translational machinery detects and responds to the cotranslational MP misfolding. In a recent
study of the topological properties of the Sindbis virus (SINV) structural polyprotein, our team found that the
translocon-mediated membrane integration of the nascent polypeptide stimulates ribosomal frameshifting and
the premature termination of translation. This work revealed that cotranslational (mis)folding can alter translation
through programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF), which is typically viewed as an RNA-mediated translational
recoding mechanism. In the following, we outline evidence suggesting translocon-mediated PRF occurs during
the translation of many human MPs, including several misfolding-prone MPs such as the cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). We provide multiple lines of evidence that demonstrate that PRF
can occur at several “checkpoints” during CFTR synthesis, and show that a pathogenic mutation known to induce
cotranslational misfolding (ΔF508) stimulates ribosomal frameshifting and the premature termination of CFTR
translation. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that PRF sites allow the ribosome to tune the processivity
of translation in response to conformational transitions in the nascent chain. To test this hypothesis, we will
assess how mutations and small molecules that alter cotranslational CFTR folding impacts the processivity of
translation at each PRF site. To gain structural insights into this ribosomal frameshifting mechanism, we will also
extend our studies on the SINV structural polyprotein. To map the sequence constraints of translocon-mediated
PRF, we measured the effects of 2,003 mutations on the efficiency of ribosomal frameshifting by deep mutational
scanning. Our preliminary results reveal several structural features that appear to be critical for PRF, including
a putative lipid-binding face within a nascent transmembrane domain and a helical segment within the ribosomal
exit tunnel. To determine how these structural features induce PRF, we propose a novel fusion of molecular
modeling, cellular biochemistry, and virology experiments to elucidate these structural features. Finally, we will
leverage these insights to develop sequence-based energetic predictions for the efficiency of PRF within integral
MPs. We will also characterize putative PRF sites in several disease-linked MPs in order to validate these
findings and explore the potential role of PRF in MP homeostasis. Together, these investigations will provide
fundamental insights into a novel cotranslational feedback mechanism and the molecular basis of disease."

Background: Converging lines of evidence suggest that neuromodulation of the neural circuits underlying
methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) and subsequent relapse may be an innovative next step in improving
treatment outcomes. Emerging research supports the salience network (SN) as a promising target to
accomplish these goals. Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) is one type of neuromodulation
technique that allows for deeper stimulation of cortical neurons, thus reaching core nodes of the SN like the
insula. Objective: The aim of this 2-phase proposal is to assess: 1) whether the H4 coil protocol is effective at
engaging the AIns core node of the SN, 2) does this coil and protocol engage the neural target better than a
sham condition, and 3) does stimulation of this core node have downstream effects on behavior (i.e., relapse
risk). Methods/Design: In the UG3 phase, we will enroll 30 treatment-seeking participants with MUD into a
mechanistic trial to determine whether this treatment site and protocol effectively modifies the desired neural
target and reduced relapse rates. Participants will receive 30 sessions of 10Hz dTMS to the insula and PFC
using the H4 coil. Participants will receive 3 dTMS treatments per day for 10 days totaling 30 treatment
sessions. Participants will complete neuroimaging assessments at baseline, after 50% of treatment sessions,
post-treatment and 1 month after treatment. In order to advance to the UH3 phase, we will require that dTMS
increases activation (of at least a medium effect size) to the respective neural target AND result in reduced
relapse rates relative to treatment as usual. If the UG3 milestone criteria are met, in the UH3 phase we will
enroll an additional 60 adults with MUD into a 2-arm randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled mechanistic
trial to confirm target engagement relative to sham, assess the impact of the protocol on methamphetamine
use behaviors, and determine moderators of treatment response. Specific Aims: For the UG3 (Study 1), we
aim to demonstrate feasibility, tolerability and target engagement (neural and behavioral improvements). If
milestone criteria are met, in the UH3 phase (Study 2), we aim to 1. Confirm target engagement in a 2-arm
randomized, double blind, sham-controlled trial. 2. Examine the relationship between target engagement to a
more refined measure of use behaviors (i.e., % days abstinent). 3. Determine predictors of treatment
outcomes. Impact: The proposed research will elucidate mechanisms of brain and behavior change,
accelerate the development of new, device-based, treatment options and will be the basis for developing a
large-scale, dose-varying, clinical trial to test new treatment strategies for MUD."
11003550,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Anxiety is a common and impairing psychiatric comorbidity affecting up to 70% of youth with autism spectrum
disorder (ASD) for which there are very limited evidence-based treatments. Gold-standard treatment approaches
including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are often
unsuitable, ineffective, or poorly tolerated in youth with ASD. No large scale, well-powered clinical trials of
pharmacotherapy for anxiety in ASD have been published. Prior research on anxiety in ASD has key
methodological limitations including the lack of high quality clinical endpoints, objective biomarkers, or known
mechanisms underlying treatment response. Our long-term goal is to advance the evidence-based treatment for
anxiety in youth with ASD by identifying underlying treatment mechanisms and conducting high quality clinical
trials. The objectives of this proposal are to (1) identify autonomic nervous system (ANS) measures that can be
obtained in youth with ASD which correlate with anxiety severity in the K99 phase (Aim 1) and (2) to conduct a
randomized controlled trial of buspirone to preliminarily assess its efficacy (Aim 2) and whether ANS modulation
is a target mechanism (Aim 3) in the R00 phase. This contribution is significant since youth with ASD commonly
experience anxiety disorders and there are limited evidence-based treatments. The proposed research is
innovative in that it will be the first ASD clinical trial to incorporate objective physiologic mechanisms, decreasing
overreliance on subject self-/parent-report or clinician rating. Aims of the principal investigator’s K99 career
development and training plan include (1) Obtain training and applied experience acquiring and interpreting
autonomic nervous system (psychophysiology) data in youth with ASD, (2) Develop expertise in
psychopharmacology clinical trials design and execution, (3) Develop familiarity with applied biostatistics relevant
to intervention trials, and (4) Advance skills in manuscript preparation, grantsmanship, leadership, and
responsible conduct of research. These goals will be achieved through a training plan comprised of mentorship,
formal coursework, conferences, and manuscript/grant preparation. Knowledge gained via the training plan will
be augmented by the applied research experience. Drs. Christopher McDougle, Kerry Ressler, Sabine Wilhelm,
David Eddie, and Caitlin Ravichandran will serve as mentors on this award. Massachusetts General Hospital-
Harvard Medical School provides an exceptional environment in which to conduct this training and research. By
the end of the R00 period, the principal investigator will have a working methodology for obtaining ANS measures
relevant to clinical trials in youth with ASD and anxiety, a preliminary estimate of the placebo effect and
buspirone-placebo difference, and sample size needed to more fully test physiologic mechanisms. These will
inform a multi-site R01 effectiveness trial of buspirone or other anti-anxiety medications. The principal
investigator will also have the training and experience needed to successfully obtain R61/R33 funding to test
novel agents that are either in active development or repurposed non-CNS agents for anxiety in this population."

Despite decades of research, little is known about how to effectively prevent postoperative delirium or postoperative
cognitive dysfunction; however, emerging perspectives on the role of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in health and
disease suggest that increased permeability (BBB dysfunction) may be associated with the development of
postoperative delirium (POD) and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Up to half of all older adults develop
POD, and POCD is reported in 5-20% of surgical patients over 65 years; at present, neither condition can be
effectively prevented nor treated and both are associated with decreased quality of life and survival, as well as
numerous other negative outcomes. Our long-term goal is to advance knowledge of the effects of surgical stress on
the aging brain, ultimately leading to effective strategies to improve the cognitive safety of surgery. The objective of
this research is to investigate the extent to which an innovative brain imaging technique, water exchange index MRI
(WEI-MRI) evidence of BBB dysfunction predicts the incidence of POD and POCD, in a longitudinal study of older
adults undergoing major elective non-cardiac surgeries. Our central hypothesis is that in the aging brain, BBB
dysfunction is a biomarker for brain vulnerability that predicts increased risk for POD, POCD, and progressive
cognitive decline. We will test this hypothesis by accomplishing the following specific aims: 1) Evaluate
associations between BBB permeability and the incidence of POD; 2) Evaluate associations between BBB
permeability and the incidence of POCD; and 3) Identify changes in markers of endothelial injury and
inflammation in peripheral blood that predict POD and POCD. This approach is innovative because it employs a
noninvasive technology to precisely measure BBB permeability and pinpoint the area(s) of the brain in which it
occurs. The proposed research is significant in that it will lay essential groundwork for development of future
interventions to improve the cognitive safety of major elective surgeries in the aging population. Recognition of BBB
dysfunction may be of critical prognostic importance in determining brain susceptibility to surgical stress."

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common hemolytic disorder affecting African Americans. In situ (de novo)
acute pulmonary thrombosis is the underlying cause in ~20% of SCD patients hospitalized with respiratory
failure. The current therapy for pulmonary thrombosis in SCD is primarily supportive and a preventive therapy
does not exist. Autopsy and computed tomography studies have identified that occlusion of pulmonary arterioles
by platelet-rich thrombi contributes to development of pulmonary thrombosis in SCD patients. Adenosine
diphosphate (ADP) released from lysed erythrocytes activates platelets by stimulating purinergic P2Y1 and
P2Y12 receptors. We recently discovered that this pathway promotes pulmonary thrombosis following acute-
hemolysis in control mice, suggesting that ADP-induced purinergic signaling may also promote pulmonary
thrombosis in SCD. However, P2Y12 receptor antagonists have shown no benefit to SCD patients in recent
clinical trials, and it remains unknown why pulmonary thrombosis develops only in a sub-set but not all SCD
patients. Identifying molecular and genetic mechanisms that trigger pulmonary thrombosis in SCD, would enable
the development of Precision Medicine diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for these at-risk SCD patients.
Based on our new preliminary findings, we hypothesize that CD39 (ecto-nucleotidase) present in circulating
extracellular vesicles (EVs) degrades excess ADP to prevent pulmonary thrombosis in SCD, however, single-
nucleotide-polymorphism (SNP) rs3176891G in the CD39-encoding gene (ENTPD1) attenuates this protection
and identifies SCD patients who can benefit from anti-purinergic therapy. We will test this hypothesis using our
newly developed mouse model of pulmonary thrombosis triggered by intravenous (IV) administration of ADP, in
vivo imaging of lung in live mice, in vitro microfluidic studies with SCD patient blood, isolation and characterization
of EVs, SCD mice genetically deficient in CD39, and genetic analyses in SCD patients with vs without SNP
rs3176891G. In Aim 1, we will determine whether ADP-induced platelet aggregation and pulmonary thrombosis
is impaired in SCD. In Aim 2, we will determine whether CD39-carrying circulating EVs degrade excess ADP to
prevent pulmonary thrombosis in SCD. In Aim 3, we will determine whether SNP rs3176891G promotes
pulmonary thrombosis event in SCD patients by attenuating CD39-carrying EVs, leading to increased ADP-
induced platelet aggregation. These studies will introduce a novel paradigm that CD39-carrying EVs prevent
pulmonary thrombosis in SCD, and lead to first-ever Precision Medicine in SCD by identifying rs3176891G as
a risk for pulmonary thrombosis."
11002820,"Project Abstract
People living with HIV (PLWH) have poor clinical outcomes when they are excluded from care due to
intersectional stigma related to HIV, mental health (MH), and other dimensions. Recent studies and reviews
have highlighted three major challenges in identifying and addressing intersectional stigma: a lack of stigma
assessment strategies that are multi-dimensional and can be incorporated into routine clinical care, a lack of
tailored stigma-reduction activities, and a lack of implementation of multi-level interventions. These gaps make
it difficult to recognize and address intersectional stigma, leading to poor HIV care outcomes globally.
Digital health tools, co-designed with PLWH and healthcare workers (HCWs), have the potential to assist ART
centers in addressing these challenges. Guided by the principles of human-centered design, which our team
has utilized in a recent R34 study to improve adherence to HIV care in Nepal, we now propose to develop and
pilot test a digital tool with three components that can address the challenges in assessing, prioritizing, and
addressing intersectional stigma in ART centers. The components include: 1) a dynamic assessment strategy
that can be used during a clinic visit to collect both quantitative (i.e., ratings) and qualitative data (i.e., free text
of client’s perspectives) on stigma reported by PLWH; 2) a dashboard that incorporates this stigma
assessment data alongside routine clinical data (i.e., existing registry of clients in the ART center) so that ART
centers can directly link stigma with care engagement, and also identify relevant stigma-reduction activities;
and 3) a repository of evidence-based, culturally appropriate activities that can reduce stigma at the
intrapersonal-, interpersonal-, and clinic-levels.
The three components of the digital intervention are theoretically grounded and are based on prior studies and
consultations with local partners. The study’s Aim 1 is: To iteratively develop the digital health tool
INterseCtional stigma assessment and reduction at multiple Levels and mUltiple DimEnsions (INCLUDE) for
routine use in ART centers. We will achieve this by developing INCLUDE through a co-design process
involving PLWH, HCWs, researchers. We will then pre-pilot INCLUDE at a single ART center to prepare it for
Aim 2: To assess the acceptability and feasibility of INCLUDE among clients, HCWs, and ART center leads in
four ART centers. For this aim, we will conduct a pilot trial at four ART centers to assess the acceptability and
feasibility of INCLUDE. The human-centered co-design process ensures that INCLUDE meets the needs of
stakeholders and can be integrated into routine care. This project brings together our team’s longstanding
expertise and experience in HIV, stigma, MH, digital health, and in working closely with the local government. If
successful, this study will provide an intervention that can be incorporated into routine clinical practice to
systematically identify and address intersectional stigma to improve HIV care, and can be tested in a cluster
randomized trial with ART centers in Nepal and other regions that face similar challenges."
11003832,"Project Summary As thought-leaders now deconstruct the recent global pandemic, there is a conclusive and
resounding argument to conduct enhanced surveillance to accurately anticipate future outbreaks due to
endemic viral pathogens and, that to minimize the global health impact of future outbreaks, we must target the
most vulnerable among us. In our recently funded SBIR Phase I project, our team of affiliate scientists
developed and implemented a wastewater-sampling approach to monitor for COVID-19 and demonstrated that
we can utilize predictive modelling approaches to anticipate future COVID outbreaks by up to seven days.
Importantly, these models are flexible and potentially generalizable: leveraging aspects of epidemic trajectories
that span numerous disease classes and types. As part of our SBIR Phase I efforts, we also talked to well over
100 different potential clients, industry thought leaders and influencers. These conversations, combined with
our technical research, have led us to recognize that the impact of our predictive technology is highest within
the U.S. long-term care facility (LTCF (including skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), assisted living facilities (ALFs)
and other congregate living facilities (CLFs)) market – a >$173 billion annual market which is rapidly expanding
with an aging U.S. population and rising health care costs, further confounded by a massive labor shortage in
LTCFs. Our non-invasive (facility-level sewage outflow) sampling which requires little-to-no facility staff time
and can lead to highly accurate predictions of impending outbreaks is poised to have a massive and disruptive
impact on best practices for infectious disease risk mitigation in the LTCF market. However, while our Phase I
work provided critical proof-of-concept data and a clear potential pathway for commercialization, key critical
gaps still exist including: (a) validating predictive ability at the facility level, (b) demonstrating the ability to
model diseases beyond just COVID-19 to maximize impact (e.g., RSV, Influenza and norovirus) and (c)
demonstrating the ability to make predictions in real-time that impact facility level infectious disease behaviors
to reduce outbreak impact and yield tangible ROI for LTCFs. Thus, in this Phase II proposal, we leverage our
globally recognized team of wastewater based epidemiology (WBE) and data science experts, in partnership
with two of the largest U.S. based LTCF networks (Good Samaritan Society; Western Home Services), and the
leading non-profit LTCF advocacy organization in the U.S. (LeadingAge) to conduct the critically necessary
next steps in testing and implementation of our Phase I technology, in order to position the Aquora SecureCare
technology for full commercialization. In Phase II, we will (Aim 1) demonstrate the ability to anticipate locations
with future outbreaks across a wide range of infectious disease targets with significant lead time and (Aim 2)
demonstrate how WBE model predictions can be optimized to be useful for LTCFs. This Phase II work will
provide the critically needed, validation requested by our emerging LTCF partners that will enable us to engage
with these and more partners in full “Phase III” commercialization and (external) investment."

 Historically, bias in the U.S. has made it difficult for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer
(LGBTQ+) people to marry and form families. The situation is changing, due to a recent dramatic shift in legal
and societal acceptance of LGBTQ+ marriage and family building. People who identify as LGBTQ+ and whose
relationships do not fit within heterosexual and/or cisgender norms—are increasingly having children or
considering having them.
 LGBTQ+ parents generally experience similar parenting problems as heterosexual, cisgender parents, but
they also face unique challenges related to their sexual orientation and/or gender identity. LGBTQ+ parents
need effective, evidence-based training to address their unique needs and develop skills to mitigate external
stressors and facilitate resilience and empowerment. The lack of targeted parenting resources is a serious
problem for LGBTQ+ parents.
 Parenting education interventions can increase the use of effective strategies and improve long-term child
behavioral and mental health outcomes. The most effective parenting interventions rely on and model
evidence-based strategies for specific parent populations. However, despite the growing number of LGBTQ+
families with children, few services and interventions address their concerns.
 The proposed project, Evidence-based Parent Training for Diverse Families (PTDF), will address this gap
in research and practice. We will use information gathered from preliminary research and in Phase I to inform
the program content and produce numerous eLearning modules and user engagement tools. We will then
conduct a randomized controlled trial with 240 LGBTQ+ parents from two-parent families. Over 17 weeks, we
will test whether, compared to a wait-listed control condition, the full PTDF intervention improves self-reported
parent outcomes of stress, self-efficacy, knowledge, and parenting skills, as well as parent-reported child
behavior and stress variables. We also will examine the intervention's usability, content validity, educational
utility, relevance, acceptability, and user satisfaction. By the end of this Fast Track project, we will have an
appropriate, validated parent training product to improve parenting skills and child outcomes for LGBTQ+
families."

typhoidal Salmonella strains interact with MΦs remains limited, with most research focused on non-typhoidal S.
Typhimurium (STm). This gap in knowledge spurred our investigation. To bridge this gap in knowledge, we’ve
employed unbiased methodologies, including random barcode transposon-site sequencing (RB-TnSeq) library
screens under infection relevant conditions, genomic comparisons across different Salmonella serovars, and
transcriptional profiling of MΦs infected by STy. These approaches have allowed us to identify typhoidal-specific
fitness traits and factors. Our preliminary findings suggest that essential genes governing metal homeostasis
contribute to typhoidal Salmonella’s fitness in MΦs due to pseudogenization of genes functioning in similar
pathways. We have designed experiments to test these hypotheses (Aim 1). Furthermore, our bioinformatics
analyses have led us to a putative typhoidal-specific virulence factor, which is translocated into MΦs via a type
3 secretion system (T3SS) and is vital for intracellular replication. We will take molecular and biochemical
approaches to characterize this unique virulence factor within human MΦs (Aim 2). Finally, our comparative
transcriptional profiling of MΦs containing replicating vs. non-replicating STy has unveiled a distinctive phenotype
for MΦs containing replicating bacteria – anti-inflammatory, M2-like MΦs marked by phosphorylated STAT3
(pSTAT3). Elevated pSTAT3 levels in STy-infected MΦs are T3SS-dependent, suggesting that STy effectors
manipulate the metabolic and immune landscape of human MΦs. We are determined to uncover specific
virulence factors employed by STy to shape MΦ phenotypes (Aim 3). In essence, our research delves into the
intricate strategies employed by typhoidal Salmonella to manipulate the host and inform new strategies for
combating this formidable pathogen effectively."

Pharmacogenomics has shown itself to be on the leading edge of clinical translatability in genomic medicine,
with findings that are currently implemented across the US and internationally. Clopidogrel is an oral prodrug
used to treat coronary artery disease. Several pharmacogenomic studies have consistently shown that single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CYP2C19 are associated with clopidogrel efficacy and adverse events. No
study has comprehensively studied the transcriptomic and epigenomic associations to clopidogrel response
outside of European populations, with no studies in admixed populations. Thus, the ability of non-European
populations to benefit equitably from those pharmacogenomic findings in clopidogrel is unknown. We propose a
study of clopidogrel response in admixed Caribbean Hispanics. Our preliminary data shows that local ancestry
is an important consideration in understanding genomic associations to clopidogrel response, gene expression
and predictive modeling in admixed populations. We have also included a study of SDoH within this study
population to assess how social factors may impact overall healthcare in this understudied population. We have
assembled a team with long-standing expertise in patient recruitment and engagement in Puerto Rico, public
health, pharmacogenomics, and genomic methods in admixed populations to accomplish 3 aims: AIM1: Creation
of a multi-omic dataset and predictors of clopidogrel response in PR. We will collect biospecimens for all 3 omics
data types (genomics, transcriptomics and epigenomics) in 200 participants at two time points (prior to
clopidogrel dosing and after 1 month of therapy), and from 200 healthy controls. We will measure P2Y12
Reactivity Units at each time point and will follow all participants for 1 year to identify adverse events. We will
compare differences in the transcriptome (platelet) and the DNA methylome for association to clopidogrel
response at each time point. AIM2: We will use both the Social Vulnerability Metric (SVM), a composite measure
of SDoH variables, and the CAT-SDoH, a computer adaptive personal assessment tool, to evaluate how social
vulnerability may impact the outcomes of clopidogrel drug therapy. AIM3: We will develop a platelet gene
expression prediction model using our LA-GEM methodology using healthy Caribbean Hispanic controls and
then conduct a TWAS on our Caribbean Hispanic clopidogrel cohort. Our proposed work will bring equity to the
pharmacogenomics of clopidogrel in this understudied population."
10981642,"Life-long caloric restriction (CR) prevents age-related decline in kidney health, including impaired mitochondrial
function, lipid accumulation, and inflammation. We determined that renal expression of the nuclear hormone
receptors the estrogen related receptors (ERRs) ERRα, ERRβ, and ERRγ decreases with age, and that CR
prevents this decrease. We found that treatment of 22-month-old mice with a pan ERR agonist upregulates the
renal expression of ERRα and ERRγ, and reverses the increase in urinary albumin excretion, the impaired
mitochondrial function, and the increase in inflammation. However, knowledge gaps remain, including 1) the
podocyte and tubule specific effects of ERRα or ERRγ, and if beneficial effects of ERRs on age-related kidney
disease depend on 2) alterations in kidney lipid composition and 3) proinflammatory immune cells.
Hypothesis: We hypothesize that ERRs play an important role in modulating age-related kidney disease. We
propose that: (1) decreased expression of ERRα or ERRγ accelerates age-related kidney diseases, whereas
increased expression of ERRα or ERRγ slows age-related kidney disease (SA1); (2) ERRs modulate age-related
kidney disease by inhibiting the increased synthesis and accumulation of ceramides and glycosphingolipids
(SA2); (3) ERRs modulate age-related kidney disease by inhibiting proinflammatory immune cells (SA3).
In SPECIFIC AIM 1, we will test the hypothesis that inducible decreased expression of ERRα or ERRγ in the
podocytes or the tubules accelerates, whereas inducible increased expression of ERRα or ERRγ in the
podocytes or tubules slows age-related kidney disease.
In SPECIFIC AIM 2, we will test the hypothesis that ERRs modulate age-related kidney disease by inhibiting
the increased synthesis and accumulation of ceramides and glycosphingolipids.

Children show dramatic developments in executive functioning, the goal-directed processes that support
flexible adaptation of behavior in response to changing circumstances. Variations in executive functioning
during childhood predict important life outcomes across childhood and adolescence into adulthood, including
behavioral, health, socioemotional, and academic outcomes. Executive functions are impaired in clinical
disorders including depression, ADHD, autism and schizophrenia. Discoveries about executive functioning are
thus of fundamental importance to understanding and promoting precursors to optimal mental, behavioral, and
physical development. Given this significance, many studies and intervention attempts have focused on
understanding and supporting children’s capacity to engage executive functions. However, children adaptively
coordinate whether to engage executive functions based on a variety of factors beyond capacity. Children may
elect not to engage executive functioning because it is unlikely to pay off or to be worth the effort, or is not
valued by others around them. These choices can have cascading effects, supporting the development of
habits that make it harder (or easier) to engage executive functions in the future. Variations in executive
functioning and associated outcomes across individuals and diverse groups may reflect such adaptations. This
project thus investigates how executive functions are adaptively coordinated across development to match
environmental demands, how these adaptations can be harnessed during sensitive time periods to develop
effective interventions, and how these adaptations lead to cascading effects that are important to healthy
development. We systematically investigate these underexplored processes across three key domains relating
to executive function: A) temporal dynamics, B) delay of gratification, and C) response inhibition and mental
effort. Within each domain, we test three hypotheses: Children’s experiences, habits, and adaptations to their
unique environments shape their decisions to engage executive functioning, such that variations in executive
function can be understood in terms of matches or mismatches between demands of the current environment
and the way children have previously learned to engage executive function (Aim 1). Interventions will be
effective if they increase children’s decisions to engage executive functions and build habits around engaging
executive functions in relevant contexts (Aim 2). Children’s adaptations in their executive functioning have
cascading effects on their learning and academic achievement, challenge-seeking, problem behaviors, and
other executive functions, leading to benefits and costs and explaining links between executive function and
healthy development (Aim 3). These multi-component studies will leverage behavioral, neurophysiological, and
self- and parent-report measures to yield rich, well-powered, longitudinal datasets and advance an integrated
developmental understanding of the adaptive engagement of executive functions, effective interventions, and
associated life outcomes."

This clinical study proposal is being submitted in response to PAS-20-160 ""Small R01s for Clinical Trials
Targeting Diseases within the Mission of NIDDK, which does not require preliminary data."" in order to
address unmet needs in the acute kidney injury (AKI) field through a novel approach to ameliorate
immunopathology. AKI is a devastating clinical disorder and major health burden with no FDA approved
drugs for its prevention or treatment. Current barriers to successful treatment of AKI include off-target effects
of pharmacological agents, the invasive nature of certain therapies, a lack of appropriate animal models of
AKI that faithfully mimic human disease, and incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of AKI. Since
our first report that a simple ultrasound (US)-based protocol reduced tissue and systemic inflammation and
prevented ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in mice, we have demonstrated that this effect was dependent
on the spleen and functional α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7nAChRs). These observations are
consistent with the hypothesis that US treatment activated the splenic inflammatory reflex, a neuro-
immunomodulatory pathway. Our studies indicate that the protective effect of US depends on an intact
spleen, the presence of T cells and bone marrow-derived α7nAChRs, and splenic innervation. US has
wwoptogenetics we have mapped the neurocircuit of the inflammatory reflex pathway and are now poised
to determine the effect in human AKI. In particular we will examine the effect of pulsed US on AKI induced
from cardiac surgery, due to the importance of inflammation in this disorder. This clinical study proposal is
intended to build upon and translate our preclinical studies over the past several years and is designed to
test the hypothesis that pulsed US stimulation can be used effectively in human subjects to control
pathogenic inflammatory responses through the stimulation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex
pathway. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that pulsed US stimulation within the FDA-approved limits of
diagnostic ultrasonography is able to attenuate inflammation and alter the composition of immune cells
collected from healthy subjects. Subjects will receive US targeting the splenic nerve and then immune cells
will be isolated from their blood and treated ex vivo withw inflammatory stimuli to test their inflammatory
capacity in comparison to immune cells collected prior to US. Aim 2 will test, in a pilot study, the hypothesis
that prior ultrasound stimulation in a population at risk for the development of AKI, i.e. adults undergoing
cardiac surgery, will reduce systemic inflammation and innate immunity. Additional goals will be to acertain
if there are any side effects as well as to obtain necessary data and develop the necessary elements to
conduct a large rmulticenter clinical trial to determine the efficacy of pulsed ultrasound to prevent AKI."
10990901,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal aims to identify the mechanisms by which ATM kinase suppresses lymphomagenesis. ATM is a
tumor suppressor. Germline ATM defects cause Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T) syndrome with a 25% lifetime risk
for lymphomas. ATM is also the 3rd most frequently germline mutated gene in cancers. Somatic inactivation of
the 2nd allele is found in up to 50% of Mantel Cell Lymphomas and 4-8% of common epithelial cancers. In vitro,
both DNA damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) can activate ATM kinase. In the past two funding cycles,
we investigated how ATM suppresses lymphomas via its role in DNA damage response (DDR). Using mouse
models carrying ATM null, kinase-dead (KD), or missense mutations, we identified a structural function of ATM
that is regulated by its kinase activity. As such, the expression of KD ATM leads to embryonic lethality, while
complete loss of ATM (null) is compatible with development. Moreover, compared to A-T syndrome with little or
no ATM expression, ~ 70% of ATM mutated cancer expresses inactive ATM proteins, imposing a different
lymphoma risk than the null mutation. Mechanistically, we showed that ATM exchanges rapidly at DNA damage
sites, and its exchange is coupled with catalysis. Thus, inactive ATM protein physically blocks DNA repair and
causes hypersensitivity to TopoI inhibition. Several ongoing clinical trials are designed to target ATM-mutant
cancers with TopoI inhibitors. During these studies, we found that Atm-R3008H mutation abolishes DSB-induced
but not ROS-induced ATM activation and displays delayed lymphomagenesis, suggesting Atm’s role in oxidative
stress response might also contribute to tumor suppression. Thus, we propose investigating how ATM
regulates tumorigenesis by modulating oxidative stress responses. ROS activates purified ATM via
intermolecular disulfide bonds. But whether ROS activation of ATM contributes to tumor suppression remains
unknown due to 1) the lack of seperation-of-function mutation to study ATM ROS function during tumorigenesis;
2) ROS damages DNA, confounding DSB vs. ROS induced ATM function; 3) high oxygen in tissue culture
stressed Atm-/- cells (20% O2 vs. 5% in blood). Here, we reported that loss of SLC7A11 (a system xC- antiporter
critical for suppressing ferroptosis), but not Nrf2 (the master transcriptional regulator of oxidative response)
delays lymphomagenesis in Atm-/- mice by >200 days without affecting chromosomal translocations, revealing a
vulnerability of Atm-deficient cells to ferroptosis, non-apoptotic cell death by membrane lipids peroxidation and
rupture. Moreover, we found that Slc7a11 is uniquely expressed among immature T cells. Based on these, we
hypothesize that Atm regulates ferroptosis vulnerability to suppress immature T-cell malignancies. To test
it, we will study how 1) SLC7A11 loss delays Atm-deficient thymic lymphomas, 2) ATM regulates ferroptosis
sensitivity, and 3) whether ferroptosis can target ATM-deficient cancers and T-ALL without ATM mutations. The
results will reveal the physiological link between ROS-induced ATM activation and tumor suppression and
provide new strategies to target T-ALLs and ATM-mutated cancers."

Psychiatric Genomics Consortium for PTSD
 Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurs only in vulnerable individuals after exposure to severe
traumatic events. This risk is due, in part, to 40-50% heritability of differential vulnerability. Due to increasing
collaborations across the field of PTSD genomics and the advent of new analytical tools, it is a very exciting
time for PTSD genetic risk discovery. The purpose of this application is to facilitate meta-analyses of genome-
wide association study (GWAS) data for symptoms and diagnosis of PTSD.
 We propose to conduct large-scale meta-analyses through the PTSD group of the Psychiatric Genomics
Consortium (PGC). The PGC was created in 2007 to conduct field-wide mega-analyses of individual data for 5
major psychiatric disorders. With its current 11 working groups, it is the largest consortium (>800 scientists
from 40 countries) in the history of psychiatry. The PGC has produced major findings with regard to the genetic
architecture of psychiatric disorders. The PGC-PTSD group was launched in 2013 and has been enormously
successful. Currently our multi-ethnic data collection includes genotypes from 90 studies with a total N of over
1.25 million combined cases and trauma-exposed controls. We recently identified 95 genome-wide significant
loci and generated a polygenic risk score to identify individuals at highest risk for PTSD after trauma exposure.
 We hypothesize that with an increased sample size and deeper phenotype characterization, the PGC-
PTSD will accelerate our current understanding of the genetic architecture of PTSD. Our progress thus far
demonstrates feasibility and successes of the proposed work. Aim 1 proposes to increase sample size to
450,000 PTSD cases, including 100,000 cases of non-European ancestry, conduct GWAS meta-analyses to
detect novel common variants, and identify rare copy-number variants (CNVs) and single nucleotide variants
(SNV) hypothesized to contribute to PTSD heritability. This aim will be supplemented by the contribution of
diverse ancestry groups to ensure that advances in our genetic understanding of PTSD extend across
ancestral backgrounds in Aim 2. Aim 3 is centered around the characterization of functional consequences of
identified variants. Lastly, we will address the heterogeneity of PTSD and its overlap with internalizing
disorders in Aim 4. Identifying the genetic pathways underlying PTSD will lead to improved neurobiological
understanding, enhanced prevention, and improved treatment of this debilitating and prevalent syndrome."
10994977,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The gastrointestinal (GI) epithelium directly senses components of foods we eat, which contain a variety of
nutritive and non-nutritive stimuli. These stimuli come from foods with a range of osmolality from zero (water) to
>1,500 mmol/kg-H2O for some of the saltiest foods. GI epithelial cells are not only first to sense luminal
osmoles, but these cells, along with the kidney tubular cells, encounter the largest osmole swings of all cells in
the body. In functional and motility GI disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which affect 10 - 20%
of the US population, non-nutritive aspects of diets such as osmolality are often first line therapies. For
example, FODMAPs (Fermentable Oligo-, Di-, Monosaccharides and Polyols) are targeted for elimination in
IBS diets. FODMAPs are also highly osmotically active – they are known to drive luminal volume shifts which
may lead to symptoms. Both hypo- and hyper-osmotic stimuli invoke downstream signaling that regulates GI
motility and systemic physiologic responses. The enteroendocrine cells (EECs) are specialized sensory
epithelial cells that interact with luminal stimuli, both nutritive and non-nutritive, and these cells are capable of
regulating both local and systemic physiology including GI motility. While EECs are traditionally considered to
be nutrient sensors, our lab discovered an EEC subpopulation that transduces mechanical signals, thereby
opening the door to EECs being sensors of non-nutritive stimuli. Literature has shown that EEC receptor
activation drives two main signal transduction pathways: calcium (Ca2+) and cAMP which lead to release of a
range of signaling molecules, including serotonin (5HT). To investigate how EECs sense hyper and
hypoosmotic stimuli respectively, our lab is manipulating EEC receptors: V1aR, VRAC, and Piezo2. In VRAC
proteins, Ca2+ signaling drives Cl- currents. Understanding osmo-transduction will provide mechanistic insights
into commonly used clinical therapies. The overall goal of this proposal is to uncover the mechanisms by which
osmolality is sensed by EECs and how osmotic stimuli may engage EEC signal transduction to alter release of
signaling molecules and systemic GI physiology. The hypothesis is that EECs transduce osmotic stimuli in
location and subtype-specific ways - via cytoplasmic Ca2+, Cl- and cAMP, through osmoregulatory proteins,
and secrete signaling molecules to modulate GI motility. Aim 1 investigates the cellular pathways by which
EECs transduce osmotic stimuli. Aim 2 investigates the osmotically induced extracellular release of signaling
molecules by EECs and subsequent changes in GI motility. The results of this work are poised to bridge
knowledge gaps in EEC osmo-transduction, as well as inform broader osmosensing mechanisms in sensory
epithelia. The proposed work will be carried out in an environment that provides expert knowledge towards
achieving the specified goal, including collaborations with experts in visceral signal transduction, organoid
work, and osmolality. This proposal includes a comprehensive training plan by which the PI will gain valuable
skills in the study of molecular osmo-transduction on clinically relevant questions. Along with research
activities, the plan also includes clinical training and shadowing activities to prepare the PI for her transition to
the next stage of training as a future surgeon-scientist."
10978904,"Project Summary
T cells are key components of immune responses to infection and in autoimmunity. Like all cells, they require
ion channels and transporters for their function. Channels move ions such as calcium, sodium and potassium
across lipid membranes to maintain ion gradients, facilitate signal transduction and influence many cellular
processes. Several channels are known to play critical roles in immune cells. In general, however, only a small
number of the known hundreds of channels have been studied in T cells. This is a major gap in our
understanding of T cell biology and the mechanisms underlying T cell-mediated immune responses. From a
clinical perspective, ion channels are excellent drug targets as is evident from the fact that many channel
blockers are used for the treatment of cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric disorders. There are currently no
FDA-approved drugs targeting ion channels for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. To
address this gap in knowledge and missed opportunity for drug discovery, we conducted functional genetics
screens to identify hitherto unrecognized ion channels that control T cell function in the context of infection and
autoimmunity. Some of the strongest and least understood channel-related genes to emerge from these
screens were components of the sodium-potassium ATPase. This multiprotein complex is located in the cell
membrane and uses ATP as energy source to pump sodium ions out of cells in exchange for potassium ions
that go in. In neurons, this complex is essential for electrical excitability and in the heart for the ability of muscle
fibers to contract. In T cells, by contrast, the function of the sodium-potassium ATPase and its role in immune
responses to infection and autoimmunity are almost completely unknown. We identified four subunits of the
sodium-potassium ATPase in our screens and confirmed that two of them in particular are required for the
antigen-driven expansion of T cells in vivo. This expansion of T cells during infection or in autoimmune
diseases is an essential hallmark of adaptive immunity. Our data show that deletion of ATP1B3, one of the
subunits of the sodium-potassium ATPase we identified, almost completely suppresses T cell expansion and
disease in a preclinical model of multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease in which T cells promote
inflammation and destruction of the brain. Additional data generated by using unbiased transcriptomic and
metabolomics approaches point to a role of ATP1B3 and the sodium-potassium ATPase in regulating the cell
cycle and metabolism of T cells. In this proposal, we will determine how ATP1B3 regulates the function of the
sodium-potassium ATPase in T cells, investigate the signaling and metabolic mechanisms by which ATP1B3
controls T cell function, and determine how ATP1B3 regulates T cell-mediated immune responses and its
suitability as a drug target in autoimmunity."
10978973,"PROJECT SUMMARY. The expression of debilitating fear toward stimuli previously associated with trauma even
after they no longer pose a threat is a core pathology of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Such
maladaptive fear is caused by an inability to learn that the stimuli that had been previously linked to trauma are
no longer threatening. These deficits in extinction learning are a highly prevalent dimension of PTSD and
significantly hamper quality of life. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in isolation or in combination with
pharmacotherapies are the most widely used treatments to rescue deficits in extinction learning. Such treatments
are effective in approximately 50% of treated cases, emphasizing that there is room to more effectively rescue
deficits in extinction learning. One way to achieve this objective is to first understand how extinction learning is
facilitated by molecular and cellular processes in neural circuitry that influences extinction learning. While several
neuromodulators have been implicated in the pathophysiology of PTSD, among them, dopamine has been
shown to play a central role in extinction learning. Most of our understanding of dopaminergic influences on
extinction learning has come from a focus on the A10 cluster of dopaminergic cells in the ventral tegmental area
(VTA). However, A10 cells are one of several distinct clusters of dopaminergic cells that are evolutionarily
conserved in the mammalian brain. Gaining an appreciation for how dopaminergic cells outside of the VTA may
influence extinction learning will significantly advance our understanding of how dopaminergic signaling
modulates extinction learning. More importantly, leveraging any promise that manipulating dopaminergic cells
may hold to reduce deficits in extinction learning requires understanding molecular pathways and physiological
principles that are shared by or unique to dopaminergic cell clusters across the brain to influence extinction
learning. Our long-term goal is to determine how dopaminergic cells outside of the VTA contribute to extinction
learning and recall. To achieve this goal, our immediate objective with this proposal is to determine molecular
and cellular mechanisms in A13 dopaminergic cells in the zona incerta (ZI) that contribute to extinction learning.
To do so, we build on our work that has studied the influences of the ZI and of A13 cells on extinction learning.
We will combine auditory fear conditioning in mice with intersectional molecular-genetics, inducible RNAi,
optogenetic-based interference of protein action, and manipulation of cellular firing after activity-based tagging
of neuronal ensembles to study molecular pathways and cellular processes that afford A13 cells the ability to
influence extinction learning. This work will illuminate basic neurobiology underlying a clinically important
dimension of PTSD (extinction learning). Positive results will highlight highly conserved processes via which
many brain regions including dopaminergic hubs influence extinction learning. Future studies will profile how
stress-induced changes in these processes in A13 cells influence their communication with targets like the
periaqueductal gray and nucleus reuniens to disrupt extinction learning."

10982793,"SUMMARY – RESEARCH PROJECT 1: Transportation, Health, and Equity: A Community-Centered
Study of Road Pricing in Washington, D.C.
On-road vehicle emissions are the top contributor to air pollution-related health burdens in Washington, District
of Columbia, where they are associated with over 50% of NO2-attributable asthma cases and 23% of air
pollution-attributable premature deaths. As in other cities, these health burdens are inequitably distributed
largely due to historical and ongoing racially discriminatory planning: PM2.5-attributable morbidity and mortality
are five times higher in most impacted areas than in the least impacted areas. District leaders are pursuing
policies to address these issues. Road pricing (alternatively called congestion pricing) is a climate change
mitigation strategy being considered in cities around the world as a way to lower greenhouse gas emissions
from the transportation sector, improve air quality, reduce congestion and commuting times, shift travel from
vehicles to public transit and other active transport modes, and improve transportation equity. These policies
will likely achieve their intended goals along and near the targeted roads, for example, but it remains unclear
whether there will be unintended consequences such as displacing emissions, air quality impacts, and adverse
health outcomes outside of the regulated zone. The primary objective of this study is to quantify health and
equity implications associated with road pricing schemes under consideration in the Washington, District of
Columbia, area. Our aims are to: (1) Identify road pricing strategies to achieve GHG emissions reduction
targets in the District by leveraging community collaborator input; (2) Quantify neighborhood-level NO2, PM2.5,
and O3 exposure and health effect changes from road pricing through the development of a novel model
framework integrating fine-scale transportation modeling, air quality modeling, and population health data; and
(3) Assess the equity implications of the proposed road pricing strategies by comparing NO2, PM2.5, and O3
exposure and attributable morbidity and mortality for different population subgroups using spatially-resolved
demographic data and race- and ethnicity-specific relative risk estimates. This study will quantify traffic, air
quality, health, and environmental justice benefits anticipated from road pricing in the District. The primary
significance of this project over existing literature is estimating health and equity benefits of proposed road
pricing schemes using fine scale, state-of-the-science transportation, air quality, and health outcomes models.
This significance builds directly from the REACH Center theme of using big data to explore climate solutions
that advance health and environmental justice, by leveraging the power of novel geospatial datasets and
research co-generation with governmental and non-governmental partners. Critically, we have developed the
research plan through community and scientific collaborations, and the results will enable future efforts to
quantify health and equity implications of proposed policies in the District. Our work will provide a framework to
employ fine-scale transportation, air quality, and population data to assess transportation policy schemes
seeking to lower GHG and TRAP emissions, improve health, and reduce environmental inequalities."
10982794,"SUMMARY - RESEARCH PROJECT 2: Landscape fire PM2.5, air conditioning, and mortality among
dialysis patients
Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) would benefit from more knowledge about health risks posed by
climate change. One risk that is not fully explored for these patients is the long-term impact of exposure to fine
particulate matter (PM2.5) from landscape fire smoke. Large wildfires, an important portion of landscape fires,
have increased in frequency and size and models project that the risk of these fires will increase in coming
years due to climate change. Though research has shown that short-term exposure to landscape fire PM2.5
(e.g., 1-30 days) increases risk of all-cause mortality among patients receiving dialysis, we do not yet know if
long-term exposure to landscape fire PM2.5 increases mortality among ESRD dialysis patients. In addition,
residential factors that may mitigate climate change-related risks have not been fully explored for ESRD
patients. One of these residential factors is residential air conditioning (AC), which may provide multiple
benefits, including potentially reducing exposure to both heat and PM2.5 (from all outdoor sources). Recent
research has shown unequal intra-urban distribution of residential AC prevalence across metropolitan areas in
the US. We will examine whether residential AC prevalence may influence mortality among dialysis patients. In
coordination with the Community Engagement Core (CEC), we will work with a patient advisory board from the
American Association of Kidney Patients (AAKP) to discuss planned and future research, disseminate results,
and plan for continued engagement. The US Renal Data System (USRDS) maintains a nationwide registry of
patients who require dialysis. We will use the USRDS data of approximately 1.5 million patients who initiated
dialysis between 2006-2018 and follow them until 2019, creating a retrospective cohort to examine whether
landscape fire PM2.5 or AC prevalence influence mortality in dialysis patients. For Aim 1, our exposure is
number of days exposed to elevated landscape fire PM2.5, defined as days when landscape fire PM2.5
exceeded the current National Ambient Air Quality Standards 24-hr standard for PM2.5 of 35 µg/m3. We will use
publicly available estimates of 24-hr mean landscape fire PM2.5 (and control for non-fire PM2.5), which uses
spatially interpolated PM2.5 observations, available on a 15 x 15 km grid, for the full contiguous US each day.
We will interpolate the data to the ZIP code level, as residential ZIP codes are available for dialysis patients.
We will use a semiparametric multi-level mixed-effect Cox hazards regression for mortality and estimate the
hazard ratios of our exposure (landscape fire PM2.5 or prevalence of AC), adjusting for both individual- and
community-level covariates. For Aim 2, AC prevalence was previously estimated for 115 metropolitan areas.
We will restrict our analyses to examine these 115 metropolitan areas and employ a similar model and
confounders. This research will provide information critical to help guide preventive strategies for dialysis
patients, a population vulnerable to health effects of climate change. Through the CEC and AAKP
engagement, we will design present and future research, disseminate findings, and engage end-users."

networking activities including Annual Research Days, research seminars, a Climate and Health Connections
lunch series, scientific working groups focusing on shared interests among Center investigators, and
expanding clinical engagement and clinical research. It will foster a strong existing interdisciplinary network
and emerging collaborations in climate-health research grants linking several Center investigators. Finally, the
Developmental Core will ensure that climate and health research is responsive to topics arising from
government and community stakeholders, collaborating closely with the Community Engagement Core. This
will be accomplished by engaging government and community partners in Pilot Awards and by co-sponsoring
workshops with the Community Engagement Core to facilitate improved knowledge-to-action and community-
engaged research. The Developmental Core will deliver innovative approaches throughout the research design
and implementation phases by prioritizing community engagement and solution-oriented goals throughout all of
its research and educational activities. The ultimate goal is for REACH research projects to be co-generated by
community and policy stakeholders in partnership with Center investigators, thereby ensuring that the research
and its results are actionable and lead towards solutions to protect health from the hazards posed by climate
change."
10982796,"PROJECT SUMMARY - COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT CORE
The REACH Center Community Engagement Core will develop and apply strategies for catalyzing the co-
creation of REACH Center climate and health research projects and study outputs in support of policy
decision-making and implementation. By serving as a bridge between REACH Center academic investigators
and multiscale stakeholders, the Core will build trust, transform solutions, speed implementation, and lower
resistance to policy change through integration of community input and involvement into Center activities,
including its investigator-initiated research projects, pilot projects, and student fellowships. As effective climate
change mitigation and adaptation requires action at all levels of governance and facets of civil society, the CEC
will engage with a variety of actors and end-user communities who are positioned to take health-protective
action on climate change. This includes civic organizations that represent communities such as mayoral
associations, regional government associations, health and hospital systems, environmental organizations,
and disease-focused associations, as well as federal, state, and local governmental agencies. Rather than
focusing on a single or small set of community groups, the CEC focuses on providing tools and frameworks
that build capacity for developing targeted, collaborative teams between investigators and end-users that have
the knowledge, skills, experiences, and agency to create change. The Core will initiate and facilitate co-design
strategies for developing and applying the outputs of scientific investigations that inform climate solutions,
including mitigation or adaptation interventions or policies. To do so, the Core will create researcher/end-user
teams by matching REACH Center research project and pilot award academic investigators with relevant
community groups, advance scientific literacy and awareness of climate change and human health links
through communication and outreach strategy support, and integrate community engagement across REACH
Center Cores. The Core will also evaluate formative REACH Center engagement and communication
strategies between investigators and potential end-users of research project outputs in the co-generation of
policy-relevant research questions and products to further advance to a Center of Excellence. This will be
accomplished by developing a set of evaluation metrics for select research and pilot project teams based on
shared objectives of researchers and end-users, and identifying successful engagement processes and
infrastructure needs for further catalyzing use of REACH Center research products in federal, state, and local
policy contexts. The Community Engagement Core will empower REACH Center investigators to develop
community-engagement skills and access networks of end-users that allows for the application of scientific
insights and tools in policy decision-making, design and implementation. These activities will establish a
pipeline of research activities capable of generating community-centered findings and supporting the
implementation of durable climate and environmental health policy solutions."
10982797,"PROJECT SUMMARY - EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT CORE
The REACH Center Exposure Assessment Core aims to provide expertise and services on big data use,
exposure assessment, and statistical analysis to support research exploring health and equity impacts of
climate solutions. The Core will develop unique, new services and capabilities in selecting and using
appropriate techniques and tools to assess exposure for a variety of climate-health research applications,
including epidemiology, risk analysis, burden of disease assessment, disease forecasting, future projections
under emission scenarios, policy analysis, and equity analysis. Datasets and tools will include satellite remote
sensing, ground stationary and mobile monitoring, statistical and geophysical modeling, among other
techniques. Specifically, the Core will build capacity among Center investigators to identify and select
appropriate geospatial climate and environmental datasets. To do so, the Core will empower researchers to
identify important climate-relevant hazards with screening-level mapping tools and aid researchers in selecting
fit-for-purpose geospatial climate and environmental datasets. The Core will also lower the barrier to using
geospatial climate and environmental datasets in research exploring health and equity impacts of climate
solutions. This will be accomplished by spatially and temporally aligning climate and environmental data with
health data, providing user guides with data descriptions and sample code, and providing consultation services
for researchers to ask questions about applying the datasets. Finally, the Core will provide statistical support,
including comprehensive statistical analysis, data usage advisory and consultancy, and conducting statistical
and collaborative research to advance beyond what is available in the current literature. The Exposure
Assessment Core will bridge the gap between novel geospatial datasets and research on health-protective and
equitable climate solutions by making geospatial climate and environmental datasets more accessible,
interoperable, and interpretable for health researchers. The Core enables the Center and the broader
community to overcome a major challenge in climate and health research: that climate and environmental data
are often spatiotemporally mis-aligned with health data, are poorly accessible to researchers outside of
geosciences, and come with various strengths, weaknesses, and uncertainties."
10982799,"Climate change is increasing temperature variability and extremes, causing both direct effects on health (e.g.,
death, heat stress) and indirect impacts on food and water supplies. Research by our team and others has
clearly demonstrated that climate change disproportionately affects individuals and communities that
experience social and environmental vulnerabilities and discrimination. There is a critical need for evidence-
based solutions to reduce the impacts of the warming climate on marginalized communities to enable timely,
effective, and impactful interventions. The Center for Climate: Equitable and Accessible Research-based
Testing for Health (C-EARTH) will catalyze transdisciplinary research approaches involving individual- and
policy-level solutions to address multiple climate risks to human health, particularly in populations at greatest
risk, reflecting our environmental justice and health equity goals. The aims of C-EARTH are to: 1) create new
research capacity for the development and evaluation of climate change and health (CCH) solutions to address
the consequences of heat and improve health equity, catalyze collaborations across disciplines, support career
development of early-stage investigators, oversee a community-based pilot grant program on CCH solutions,
and provide data infrastructure and heat tracking systems (Administrative Core); 2) identify climate-related
health effects and test CCH evidence-based solutions among the most marginalized and at-risk members of
society in partnership with community health workers and non-profit organizations in Boston, Madagascar, and
South Africa (Research Project); 3) engage with community partners to cultivate trust, communication, and
shared decision-making towards implementing community-based climate solutions that improve health
inequities (Community Engagement Core); and 4) catalyze CCH implementation science and participatory
research to implement and evaluate evidence-based solutions to address CCH and improve health equity by
providing qualitative and quantitative analytic support, policy translation, and capacity-building initiatives for
researchers and local leaders (Implementation, Solutions, and Evaluation Core). The C-EARTH leadership,
research, and multidisciplinary support team brings complementary expertise in community engagement,
environmental and population health research, nutrition, implementation science, cost-benefit analyses, health
equity, and national and international climate policy – thus enabling transdisciplinary solutions-oriented
research. C-EARTH will be instrumental in building the capacity to develop and test culturally sensitive
evidence-based solutions for climate justice in high-risk and marginalized communities around the world, with
opportunities for replication and scalable solutions to maximize impact."
10982962,"Project Summary/Abstract
Neurodevelopmental processes are shaped by dynamic interactions between genes and environments.
Maladaptive experiences early in life can alter developmental trajectories, leading to harmful and enduring
developmental sequelae. Pre- and postnatal hazards include maternal substance exposure, toxicant exposures
in pregnancy and early life, maternal health conditions, parental psychopathology, maltreatment, structural
racism, and excessive stress. To elucidate how various environmental hazards impact child development, it is
imperative that a normative template of developmental trajectories over the first 10 years of life be established
based on a sufficiently large and demographically diverse sample of the US population. To accomplish this, the
Healthy Brain and Child Development National Consortium (HBCD-NC) has been formed to deploy a
harmonized, optimized, and innovative set of neuroimaging (MRI, EEG) measures complemented by an
extensive battery of behavioral, physiological, and psychological tools, and biospecimens to understand
neurodevelopmental trajectories in a sample of 7,500 mothers and infants enrolled at 24 sites across the United
States (US). The HBCD-NC will carry out a common research protocol under direction of the HBCD-NC
Administrative Core (HCAC) and will assemble and distribute a comprehensive and well-curated research
dataset to the scientific community at large under the direction of the HBCD-NC Data Coordinating Center
(HDCC). The overarching goal of the HBCD-NC is to create a comprehensive, harmonized, and high-
dimensional dataset that will characterize typical neurodevelopmental trajectories in US children and that will
assess how biological and environmental exposures affect those trajectories. A special emphasis will be placed
on understanding the impact of pre- and postnatal exposure to opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco and/or other
substances. To address these broad objectives, the sample of women enrolled will include: 1) a racially,
ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse cohort that is representative of the US population; 2) pregnant woman
with use of targeted substances (opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco); and 3) demographically and behaviorally
similar women without substance use in pregnancy to enable valid causal inferences. In addition, the HBCD-NC
will identify key developmental windows during which both harmful and protective environments have the most
influence on later neurodevelopmental outcomes. The large, multi-modal, longitudinal, and generalizable dataset
that will be produced for the first time by this study will provide novel insights into child development using state-
of-the-art methods. The HBCD-NC study will inform public policy to improve the health and development of
children across the nation."
10983044,"ABSTRACT (OVERALL)
Climate change is an unprecedented threat intensifying health risks and disparities. Social and structural factors
like material need insecurities and the built environment converge with climate change to amplify health harms
for disproportionately impacted groups, and these factors can be targeted to improve communities’ resilience to
climate-sensitive exposures. California is an ideal test bed for pioneering climate-health solutions, as a global
leader in climate action with extensive experience on the frontlines of climate change and with diverse climate-
affected communities. The proposed Equity and Climate Opportunities for Health (ECO-Health) Center at the
University of California will use a precision climate and health approach to build a pipeline of epidemiological
and community-engaged research characterizing how modifiable social and structural factors shape key health
outcomes and disparities across the lifespan in the context of climate-sensitive exposures. The Center will
channel this evidence into equitable climate resilience solutions co-developed and implemented with
disproportionately impacted communities. To achieve these goals, the ECO-Health Center will undertake three
specific aims. Aim 1 will be to develop and sustain diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA)-centered
researcher training and career development programs, using a foundation of adaptive expertise, to foster the
development of early-career, under-represented, and community-based researchers who can generate
actionable climate-health knowledge. This will include mentorship, training in state-of-the-art methods, including
machine learning, implementation science, and community-engaged research, and evidence-to-policy
translation to support transdisciplinary projects. In Aim 2, through a Research Project, data dashboard, and pilot
projects, the ECO-Health Center will generate localized evidence and action-oriented research strategies to
address climate and health justice. Researchers will employ cutting-edge methods to uncover multi-dimensional
climate-health vulnerabilities in the contexts of extreme heat and wildfire smoke as well as their co-occurrence,
and model hypothetical resilience interventions at the local level. Findings will inform targeted, co-designed
strategies to alleviate disparities through modifications of the built environment and reduced material need
insecurities. Fundamental to this work will be the Center’s commitment to developing and maintaining strong,
collaborative academic-community research partnerships that are rooted in the principles of equity and justice
and embrace the goal of achieving tangible, equitable health benefits for all. In Aim 3, a Community Engagement
Core will follow principles of environmental justice to facilitate community perspectives, disseminate actionable
findings, and build capacity. Ultimately, the ECO-Health Center will pioneer a framework for health equity
solutions generalizable across climate-health challenges in the U.S. and worldwide, and will build an innovative,
adaptive, and transdisciplinary community of practice prepared to meet the evolving health and equity challenges
arising from climate change."
10983045,"ABSTRACT (ADMIN CORE)
Climate change is an unprecedented threat to human health and converges with modifiable social and structural
factors to amplify health risks and health disparities among disproportionately impacted populations. Our mission
is to establish the ECO-Health Center (Equity and Climate Opportunities for Health) at the University of California
(UC) to drive solutions-focused, community-engaged research on the complex intersection of climate change,
the social and structural context, and poor health outcomes. The Administrative Core (AC) of the proposed
Center will provide pivotal leadership, coordination, and oversight to achieve the Center’s aims. The AC will
operate through four key administrative bodies, each serving a distinct yet complementary role. The Executive
Committee will lead the AC and serve as the primary decision-making body, overseeing scientific, programmatic,
and administrative decisions for the Center. The Career Development and Training Unit will ensure that a diverse
cadre of learners at all levels are engaged in the Center’s research activities through workshops, works in
progress, and training programs on climate epidemiology, causal inference methods, machine learning,
implementation science, intervention development, and community-engaged research. The Data Analytic Unit
will develop and maintain the Center’s data hub, including ensuring data harmonization, protocol sharing, and
data availability and accessibility via online platforms. The Community-Engaged Research Development Unit
will oversee the administrative processes of the pilot grants, including soliciting, selecting, and assessing
community-partnered pilot projects. The work of the AC will also be guided by four advisory bodies – the Internal
Advisory Committee (IAC), the External Advisory Committee (EAC), the Community Advisory Board (CAB), and
the NIH Research Coordinating Center/Climate Change and Health Community of Practice – that will provide
guidance on the operations and progress of the Center. While ensuring equitable engagement with scientists
and communities, the AC aims to (1) Provide scientific and programmatic leadership to the ECO-Health Center,
(2) Build the foundation for effective partnerships and foster communication and synergies between all Center
elements, and (3) Ensure efficient and responsive management of the Center’s operations, finances, and other
resources. We are committed to including people from diverse perspectives, disciplines, and expertise in every
component of the AC to facilitate communications and collaboration, and foster innovation. We will engage
communities disproportionately impacted by climate change in all phases of the Center’s research and training.
By providing administrative guidance and coordinating structures, the Administrative Core will accelerate high-
impact, community-engaged research on equitable climate-health resilience within California communities
disproportionately harmed by climate hazards. The ultimate goal is to position the ECO-Health Center as a
leading research institution, laying the groundwork for future research focused on climate, health, and equity."
10983046,"ABSTRACT (RESEARCH PROJECT)
Extreme heat and wildfire smoke events are projected to increase in frequency. They are currently impacting
health in California and around the world; however, health effects of co-occurring extreme heat and high-
intensity wildfire smoke at the same time are understudied. Disproportionately impacted communities are the
most exposed to these climate-sensitive events, the most sensitive to their adverse effects, and the least likely
to have the economic, social, or political resources necessary to prepare for or recover from such events.
Inequities in exposures translate to inequities in health, and we will approach this climate health challenge with
data-driven and community-engaged strategies to understand and mitigate exposures in highly impacted
communities. We propose to investigate, in the broadest and largest study to date, the impact of co-occurring
heat waves and wildfire smoke on health effects across the life course including pregnancy outcomes,
infectious diseases, respiratory conditions, and cardiovascular disease. Selected health outcomes will include
low birth weight, preterm birth, and gestational hypertension (pregnancy), healthcare utilization, lower
respiratory tract infections (LRTI), and asthma (pediatric), and healthcare utilization, LRTI, asthma, chronic
obstructive lung disease, myocardial infarction, and heart failure (adult). We will investigate how these
relationships may be modified by multiple social and structural conditions at the small-scale level including the
built environment and insecurities in material needs like food, housing, income, and healthcare. We will identify
promising social and structural factors to model and target for intervention design and build upon community-
partnered work to mitigate exposures and health effects attributable to extreme heat and wildfire smoke
events. Our multidisciplinary team of climate scientists with clinical, environmental, and epidemiological
expertise will collaborate to identify climate-related vulnerabilities in the structural and social context in
disproportionately impacted communities that can be translated into equitable solutions for health through
community-collaborative research partnerships. Our aims are to: 1) Examine health effects of co-occurring
extreme heat and wildfire smoke exposure by social and structural factors (e.g., the built environment and
insecurities in material needs like food, housing, income, and healthcare) across California at the zip code
level; 2) Simulate the impact of community-preferred and modifiable social and structural mitigation scenarios
on health effects during co-occurring extreme heat and wildfire smoke exposure and present to community
partners; and 3) Co-design and prototype social and structural interventions to mitigate the health effects of co-
occurring extreme heat and wildfire smoke exposure. Our research project will provide the ECO-Health Center
with integrated large-scale climate and health data to quantify links, with a focus on social and structural
stressors, and innovative community-engaged and solutions-based approaches to climate justice and health
equity."
10983047,"ABSTRACT (CE CORE)
The Community Engagement (CE) Core advances the scientific mission of the ECO-Health Center by closing
the gap between research and practice through equitably engaging with California’s most disproportionately
impacted communities in all aspects of the Center’s research activities. Including communities in research that
seeks to address resources, policies, practices, and programs relevant to their well-being ensures that their
experiences and perspectives shape realistic interventions in ways that successfully mitigate the health
impacts of climate change. There is growing evidence that CE approaches are effective in the public health
arena. The CE Core will incorporate the Environmental Health Literacy framework to broadly facilitate CE
research to advance health equity in the face of a changing climate by advancing the level of literacy across
various climate health topics and promoting the mutual and bi-directional exchange of information, ideas, and
expertise between community members and climate health researchers. CE is particularly important for
strengthening the ability of scientists and communities to collaborate on climate-health research on the social
and structural context, including material need insecurities and the built environment. We will implement three
Specific Aims. Aim 1 will integrate community perspectives into high-impact climate-health research on social
and structural factors. To achieve this aim, we will partner with community stakeholders to inform ECO-Health
scientists on the most pressing issues to incorporate into climate and health research through a statewide
needs assessment, and develop the ECO-Health Community Advisory Board (CAB) to obtain relevant
community input to strengthen the design, implementation, and dissemination of research. Aim 2 will increase
community access to high-impact climate-health science on social and structural factors. With support from the
CAB, we will review, synthesize, translate, and disseminate cross-cutting climate and health research findings,
products, and approaches to facilitate their application by community members, community-based
organizations, healthcare professionals, and policy makers. We will also provide technical assistance, training,
and support to scientists and communities so both may contribute to and apply ECO-Health research findings.
Aim 3 will foster community-engaged research. We will support CE research that increases community
participation, empowerment, and influence in all phases of research, from design, implementation, and
analysis to dissemination through collaborative, sustainable, and equitable processes. We will support the
Community-Partnered Action Research Pilot teams and other ECO-Health scientists through capacity building,
including a tailored approach to developing R-level NIH proposals. Through implementing these aims, the CE
Core will support transdisciplinary ECO-Health scientists to thoughtfully engage with communities to formulate
and conduct research projects, interpret and disseminate the findings, and foster research that is prioritized by,
meaningful to, and respectful of people who are most affected by climate change."
11001019,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Intense natural disasters including hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes have become more frequent and
closely spaced in recent years. Large scale natural disasters can severely damage and degrade health care
facility structural integrity and equipment, create environmental hazards, and negatively affect health service
delivery (e.g., cancelled surgeries; postponed preventive care; pharmacy closures; staffing, medication, and
medical supply shortages; large transient surges in emergency department volume) – all of which contribute to
increased stress among health care providers. Superimposing infectious disease epidemics on the natural
disasters further exacerbates stress on the health care system. Over the span of 3 years, Puerto Rico suffered
from 3 major back-to-back public health emergencies including 2 natural disasters and a pandemic. First,
Hurricane Maria hit in September 2017 causing major devastation throughout the island. Communities lost
access to essential services such as electricity, potable water, safe roads and bridges, and health care. Most
of the island’s public and private health care facilities closed or had limited capacity for months. Second, in
December 2019, a series of more than 500 quakes of magnitude 2.0 or greater struck Puerto Rico causing
more infrastructure damage to many struggling health facilities and leaving thousands homeless or living
outside in their yards. Third, Puerto Rico continues to deal with the novel coronavirus-19 (COVID-19)
pandemic. This study will provide a unique opportunity to understand the effects of 3 distinct public health
emergencies on a minority population with significant health and health care disparities. We have designed a
mixed methods, multi-level study that will triangulate quantitative and qualitative data to study the pre and post
effects of the 3 public health emergencies on Puerto Rico’s health care system’s preparedness, response, and
recovery efforts and how the emergencies have affected the resiliency, experiences, and utilization of the
island’s health care system. The study will use administrative utilization data from 50 general hospitals and 20
federally funded health centers on the island, qualitative interviews of health system leaders and providers, and
follow-up interviews of a representative cohort of 3,062 island adult residents. Using the Donabedian quality of
care model and concepts from an emerging literature on health system resilience as our study framework, we
will 1) identify factors that influenced the capacity of Puerto Rico’s health care system to prepare for, respond
to, and recover from Hurricane Maria, the earthquakes, and COVID-19, 2) model the cumulative effects of
multiple disasters on health system resiliency and how these effects interact, and 3) elicit lessons learned from
health care leaders and providers. We will synthesize the information from our triangulated research approach
to provide data driven recommendations for an effective and coordinated approach to mitigation,
preparedness, response, and resiliency under conditions of increasing frequency and intensity of disasters."
10997607,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Opioids derived from opium are amid the oldest medications dating back to the 1800s, originally used for
gastrointestinal distress and now are among the most effective treatments for pain management. It wasn’t until
the mid-1800s that the abuse potential for opioids was evident, and this problem has since multiplied on an
international scale. Within the last decade, the number of opioid overdose deaths per year in the United States
alone has more than tripled. It is therefore urgent to not only find solutions to combat opioid overdoses, but to
also develop new treatments for pain management. Opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD), the main
cause of opioid overdose deaths, is primarily mediated through mu opioid receptors, particularly in two small
brainstem regions, the preBötzinger complex (preBötC) and the parabrachial complex (PBN) that are sufficient
and necessary to drive OIRD. Recent reports have also highlighted important cell types and downstream
molecular mechanisms within these brain regions that mediate OIRD. Moreover, several laboratories within the
last few decades have been exploring the function of the mu opioid receptor gene, Oprm1, which undergoes
extensive alternative splicing to generate two classes of splice variants: Exon 1- (E1) and Exon 11- (E11)
associated variants. The functional relevance of these splice variants has been demonstrated in mediating the
actions of various mu opioids, including analgesia, tolerance, physical dependence and reward. However, it
remains unknown how the two sets of Oprm1 splice variants influence OIRD. Preliminary data and unpublished
data from our laboratory demonstrate differential actions of E1- and E11-associated variants in OIRD from
varying doses of fentanyl and morphine in our rat models. Therefore, the overarching hypothesis is that the two
classes of Oprm1 alternatively spliced variants (i.e., E1- and E11-associated variants) in the preBötC and PBN
differentially influence OIRD. Aim 1 examines the role of E1- and E11-associated variants within two key brain
regions modulating respiration, preBötC and PBN, on OIRD in rats, and will be completed in Year 1 of this
fellowship training. Aim 2 identifies the expression of E1- and E11-associated Oprm1 variants within various
cell types of the preBötC & PBN in rats (Year 2). To test these aims, we generated two gene targeted rat
models, in which Oprm1 E1- or E11-associated splice variants can be conditionally deleted. Comprehension of
the distinct roles of E1- and E11-dependent variants on OIRD in these two brain regions and in key cell types
within these regions is expected at the end of this proposed project. Investigation of how these effects are
altered by different opioids, doses, and sexes will also be assessed. The proposed study will advance our
understanding of Oprm1 alternative splicing mechanisms and their role in OIRD, allowing us to develop
therapeutic strategies to combat OIRD."

 Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major global public health threat with approximately 296 million chronically
infected people worldwide and over 800,000 deaths per year. Chronic HBV infection is a leading cause for
development of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite the effectiveness of the prophylactic HBV
vaccine, it has no impact on established chronic infections. Consequently, there is a great need to discover new
therapeutic strategies to cure chronic HBV infection and slow or stop the resulting disease.
 The annual International HBV Meeting is the only forum that gathers the international community of
researchers who study infection, persistence, pathogenesis, and drug development for HBV and the closely
associated hepatitis delta virus (HDV). This International HBV Meeting has been held yearly since 1985 and has
been rotating between the US, Europe, East Asia and Australia. In 2024, this meeting will be held Chicago, IL,
in 2025 in Europe and the meeting site for 2026 will be determined next year.
 Success of the International HBV Meeting relies on the contributions of not only the established
investigators, but importantly, also on early career researchers from diverse backgrounds. To facilitate the
participation of young scientists, we request funding to support travel expenses for early career and under-
represented researchers at the 2024, 2025 and 2026 International HBV Meetings. The 2024 meeting will
provide the opportunity for scientific exchange and dissemination of the latest research information to discover
new strategies for potentially curing HBV and HDV. An estimated 500-600 delegates will attend the 2024
meeting. The meeting will consist of 10 oral scientific sessions, 2 poster sessions, 3 plenary lectures from experts
outside of the HBV field who will bring different perspectives, and a lecture given by the recipient of the
Distinguished Award in HBV Research that is awarded annually by the meeting. Toward the goal of curing HBV
and HDV, this meeting will host a HBV cure satellite symposium to discuss mechanisms of antiviral therapies,
and by an HBV community forum where scientists from the HBV community engage with the general public,
media, students and those affected by HBV to discuss HBV/HDV and the related diseases.
 As in the past, great effort has been made to minimize the cost of the meeting. A major strength of the
meeting organization being continual support from the Hepatitis B Foundation since 2005. To enable and
facilitate participation of early career researchers and under-represented minority investigators to maximize the
significance of the meeting, we request support from the National Institutes of Health to help defray their travel
costs. This funding will be used to ensure attendance and presentation by early career researchers, particularly
from low and middle-income countries, as well as disadvantaged and under-represented minority investigators."
11000030,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over 800 million persons worldwide have chronic kidney disease (CKD) and experience a considerable two-to-
three-fold excess risk for cardiovascular disease, starting at even the earliest stages of renal dysfunction. As
renal disease severity worsens so do the associated cardiovascular outcomes and, unfortunately, standard risk
reducing therapies become less effective or even harmful. Accumulating data suggest that systemic inflammation
is a central mechanistic trigger and driver of renal-related cardiovascular pathobiology, from the earliest through
the most advanced stages of renal dysfunction. The upstream initiation of systemic inflammation in humans is
governed primarily by small molecule derivatives of polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism, termed eicosanoids.
These bioactive lipid effectors of both pro- and anti-inflammatory activity include leukotrienes, lipoxins, and
prostaglandins. To date, the interaction between eicosanoid pathways, CKD phenotypes, and cardiovascular
outcomes remain poorly understood. This proposal aims to provide a more detailed understanding of how
upstream eicosanoid pathways can be variably active, imbalanced, and perturbed in relation to an individual’s
propensity for developing not only progressive CKD but, importantly, renal-related adverse cardiovascular
outcomes. Advanced mass spectrometry methods now allow for the rapid and accurate quantification of
hundreds of upstream eicosanoid mediators representing multiple enzymatic origins. We will use these methods
to test our hypotheses that (i) certain identifiable eicosanoid pathways underlie the development of CKD and
associated cardiovascular risk starting at the earliest stages of disease progression, (ii) perturbed eicosanoid
activity also contributes to excess cardiovascular risk in the more advanced stages of CKD, and (iii) certain
eicosanoids can be identified as intervenable mechanistic triggers of cardio-renal pathobiology and, if validated,
may later serve as therapeutic targets. We propose a systematic approach to comprehensively investigating the
components of upstream inflammatory activity in relation to outcomes across the spectrum of chronic renal
disease related cardiovascular risk. This work will pave the way for follow-up studies investigating the efficacy of
anti-inflammatory therapies, including both existing and novel agents, for modulating variation in distinct
eicosanoids and, in turn, cardiorenal outcomes."
11000924,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
Every year approximately 300,000 women die from cervical cancer, with over 90% of those deaths occurring in
low-and middle-income countries (LMICs).1 The majority of cervical cancers are preventable through vaccination
against high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV), the virus that causes nearly all cervical cancers, or by
screening for and treatment of precancerous lesions among women already infected with HPV. In 2021, the
WHO recommended HPV testing among women aged 25-49 years for all cervical cancer screening programs
worldwide.3 Despite this recommendation, access to affordable HPV testing remains a barrier, and to date, there
is limited field experience with HPV testing across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). HPV self-sampling holds great
promise in improving access to screening and promoting equity by increasing control over where, when, and
how women are screened. Preliminary data from two recent studies conducted by MD Anderson in Mozambique
have shown that cervical cancer screening with HPV DNA testing is feasible in Mozambique and that participants
in the study preferred self-collection approaches.11,12 Guided by the Knowledge-to-Action conceptual framework,
which was designed to enhance uptake of evidence-based practice into clinical care, we propose a hybrid type
III effectiveness – implementation trial to test implementation best practices of deploying the Screen & Treat
approach to cervical cancer screening utilizing self-collected HPV DNA testing within HIV care and treatment of
select health facilities. This proposal directly addresses the ability to safely scale-up a Screen & Treat approach
to cervical cancer screening. We propose to capitalize on a pool of screen-eligible women accessing routine
care within targeted HIV care and treatment services. The primary outcome of interest is the number of women
screened and the number of screen-positive women undergoing treatment. Secondary outcomes will focus on
other implementation outcomes, and if successful, will be utilized to inform future research to take this approach
to scale across Mozambique."

Bhave in her career goals to advance as a national leader in clinical trials for breast cancer and early
phase therapeutics, and in her ongoing efforts to enhance the clinical trial program at Winship. The
ECIA award will support protected time for Dr. Bhave to focus on key initiatives to increase trial
accrual at Winship through building a stronger phase I clinical trials infrastructure, and further develop
her own promising protocol concepts at the national level. The ECIA funding mechanism will
undoubtedly help foster academic growth and lead to further leadership roles within Winship and the
NCI Trial Networks."

11000569,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Puerto Rico Cancer Research Meeting (PRCRM), hosted by Universidad Central del Caribe – School of
Medicine (UCC-SOM), aims to bridge the gap in cancer research by addressing challenges faced by local
scientists and students due to geographical limitations. As the second leading cause of death in Puerto Rico,
combating cancer mortality rates becomes crucial. Limited access to resources restricts opportunities for
students and researchers to attend national scientific meetings. This one-day annual conference is an essential
platform that facilitates cross-disciplinary exchanges among underrepresented investigators, trainees, patient
advocates, and cancer survivors. It comprises diverse sessions including plenary lectures by distinguished
researchers, a cancer/survivor advocacy talk, trainees’ short talks sessions, poster and networking sessions, as
well as a UCC graduate program information session. With a primary emphasis on promoting diversity and
inclusion, this meeting targets underrepresented scientists and students from diverse backgrounds. Former
attendees of past PRCRM editions are now contributing as postdoctoral fellows, research trainees, or residents
of esteemed local and national institutions. The meeting's specific aims are:
1) To promote the dissemination of basic science and latest clinical research in cancer prevention, therapy
 resistance, innovative treatments, metastasis and health disparities to audiences in Puerto Rico.
2) To empower underrepresented trainees in the biomedical workforce from Puerto Rico and participating
 partner institutions by providing a pioneering scientific forum, and giving them a significant national venue
 to share their research work.
3) To strengthen networking and collaborative efforts between local and national institutions, fostering a
 diverse and inclusive teamworking environment for trainees, faculty, and cancer survivors.
Anticipated outcomes of the PRCRM include the stimulation of new research collaborations, the development of
grant proposals, trainee advanced career opportunities and significant advancements in cancer research. This
initiative has the potential to significantly increase the diversity in the biomedical workforce and serve as a model
for other countries with the same challenges."
11000644,"The Third Britton Chance International Symposium on Metabolic Imaging and Spectroscopy
Project Summary
Elucidation of metabolic processes is critical for a wide range of fundamental physiological research and for
clinical applications associated with cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular-, skeletomuscular-, lung-, neurological-,
and neurodegenerative-diseases, and brain function. Many researchers aim to elucidate metabolic processes,
but they do so with the perspective of a particular biomedical field or imaging technology. Unfortunately, few
opportunities exist for researchers dedicated to metabolic imaging and spectroscopy to convene outside of their
communities. Thus, the goal of this proposed conference is to bring together clinicians, biomedical scientists,
and physical scientists from different communities to collaboratively explore key topics in metabolic imaging and
spectroscopy, especially as it relates to biomedical and clinical applications. Emphasis will be placed on clinical
translation, latest technical developments, and multi-modal metabolic imaging/spectroscopy. The conference
program is aligned with the missions and interests of several NIH institutes including the NIBIB, NCI, NINDS,
NIA, and NIDDK. Specifically, the conference will feature: 1) In-depth methodology sessions that focus on
developing tools for the study of biological/physiological processes such as hemodynamics, glycolysis,
mitochondrial bioenergetics, hypoxia and redox state; these processes are common underlying factors in many
diseases; 2) Application sessions focused on the connections between metabolism and pathology in cancer,
brain, muscle, and visceral organs including heart/lung/liver/kidney; 3) Panel discussions to identify critical
research questions, innovations, clinical translation needs, and regulatory issues (e.g., IRB, IND, etc.); 4) A
workshop on career development and grant writing to help investigators, particularly new investigators; 5)
Enhanced participation of junior researchers (students, postdocs, research associates, and early-stage
investigators) facilitated by travel stipends, flash-highlight talks, poster awards, round-table small group
discussions with senior researchers; 6) Enhanced diversity by encouraging participation of minorities and women
with dedicated travel scholarships. Dr. Chance was a founding father of both in vivo NMR Spectroscopy and
Biophotonic Imaging/Spectroscopy, and he was a pioneer in the study of metabolism and physiology. He remains
inspirational for many researchers working in different subfields, due to his emphasis on cross-disciplinary
research exchange, innovation, and clinical translation, and his efforts to build the scientific community by
tirelessly educating and helping students and young researchers. Branding this event as a “Britton Chance”
symposium will help increase conference visibility within this diverse research community; indeed, >200 people
participated in each of the first two symposiums (2013, 2018). By reflecting and carrying on the scientific spirit of
Dr. Chance, we anticipate that this proposed third symposium will stimulate innovation, collaboration, and deeper
involvement of junior researchers in the field. After the symposium, both review and research manuscripts will
be solicited and published in focused issues of two peer-reviewed journals."

The ubiquitous presence of toxic metal exposures in the environment is a global public health concern, with
disadvantaged populations disproportionately exposed and susceptible to adverse effects. Lead, arsenic,
cadmium, and mercury are the most commonly occurring toxic environmental metal exposures in the general
population. These metal exposures appear among the top 7 of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease
Registry Substance Priority List, prioritizing substances based on a combination of their frequency, toxicity, and
potential for human exposure. Observations from population studies support associations between these metal
exposures and cardiovascular diseases in adulthood; however, the literature is sparse for early life
cardiometabolic health impacts. Research on the childhood origins of cardiovascular diseases shows that early
life factors influence cardiovascular risk over the life course, with adolescence a sensitive developmental

these as mechanisms for understanding how early life metal exposures can affect cardiometabolic health.
period for establishing cardiometabolic phenotype trajectories. There is emerging evidence of
DNA methylation and telomere length, thus
Addressing gaps in the current scientific literature will improve exposure remediation and risk reduction
strategies in the most vulnerable populations and provide support for new disease prevention opportunities.
The proposed epidemiologic research will provide insights on the (1) early-life health effects of metal
exposures, (2) impacts of metal co-exposures, (3) adolescence as a sensitive period for cardiometabolic
phenotype programming, and (4) mechanisms of action by which metal exposures cause cardiometabolic
dysfunction. This study's overall goal is to evaluate the effect of metal co-exposures on cardiometabolic trait
trajectories and biological aging during adolescence. We will leverage the established Bangladesh
Environmental Research in Children's Health (BiRCH) cohort, comprised of 500 youth residing in rural
Bangladesh. Enrolled participants will be aged 11 to 13 years at the time of the proposed first research visit.
We propose the following specific aims: (1) to evaluate the association of metal exposures with longitudinal
cardiometabolic traits during adolescence; (2) to evaluate the association of metal exposures with changes in
DNA methylation and DNA methylation age during adolescence; (3) to evaluate the association of metal
exposures with changes in leukocyte telomere length during adolescence. The proposed epidemiologic
research during adolescence will provide new data to unravel the effects of metal exposures on cardiovascular
diseases' pathogenesis in very early stages. This research may offer novel findings for DNA methylation and
telomere length as biosensors of metal exposures, leveraged in future studies to identify individuals at high risk
of cardiometabolic dysfunction and other relevant adverse health outcomes."
11000581,"SUMMARY
Since its inception in 1985, the goals of the Kern Lipid Conference have been to promote metabolic science and
increase understanding of metabolic pathobiology and cardiovascular disease. The conference strives to provide
an inclusive, open forum for established and young emerging scientists from academia and industry. The 2024
Kern Lipid Conference will be co-chaired by Drs. Jonathan R. Brestoff, Nada A. Abumrad, and Gregory Steinberg
and will have the theme “Lipids and Mitochondria in Cardiometabolic Diseases.” It will be held August 12-
14, 2024 at the Viceroy Hotel in Snowmass, Colorado. The primary goals of the 2024 conference are (1) to
provide a dynamic interactive environment that leads to novel insights into disease mechanisms involving lipid
metabolism and mitochondrial function and (2) to engage and inspire young scientists from diverse backgrounds
to develop their careers studying lipid biology, mitochondria metabolism, and cardiometabolic disease
pathogenesis. We will examine multiple organ systems including the cardiovascular system, heart, liver, brain,
and adipose tissue while delving into metabolic diseases including obesity, diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver
disease, and atherosclerosis, and other associated conditions such as cancer and neurodegeneration. The
program will feature 5 sessions on exciting new areas of research: (1) Lipids and Mitochondrial Metabolism in
the Brain, (2) Immune cells and Lipids in Cardiometabolic Diseases, (3) Mitochondria Transfer in
Cardiometabolic Diseases, (4) Lipids and Mitochondrial Metabolism in the Regulation of Cardiometabolic
Disease Pathogenesis, and (5) Lipids in Cancer. There will be 33 talks over a 3-day period (10 from early career
scientists), an evening poster session, and career development sessions for early career scientists. Breaks,
lunches, a closing dinner, and a closing reception on the premises promote interactions between participants.
Idea exchange is maximized by allocating ample time for questions and discussion after oral presentations. The
Kern Conference has traditionally attracted many early career scientists (~40% of the participants) and
established scholars in their fields as well as creative scientists from industry. Participation of young scientists is
strongly promoted with oral presentation opportunities, the poster session, inviting them to serve as session
chairs, and awarding 3 prestigious early-career awards that will advance their career development: the Roger
Davis Investigator Award for Transitional Faculty, the David L Williams Lecture and Scholarship Award, and the
Franz Simon Poster Award. The setting and meeting format will facilitate interaction and discussion among
attendees, making it likely that novel insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic approaches for
cardiometabolic diseases and associated comorbidities will emerge from the 2024 Conference. This R13
application is critical to the success of the 2024 Kern Conference because it will enable us to support the
attendance and highlight the research from more early career scientists (graduate students to Assistant
Professor), especially those who are from underrepresented groups in biomedical research."

11003497,"ABSTRACT
The concept of the “microbiota-gut-brain axis” has advanced to current research that supports the hypothesis
that the gut microbiome may be responsible for the cognitive decline seen in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). In our
RF1 proposal we have: 1) built a cohort of 260 older adults and have been following them over time, collecting
clinical and cognitive assessment data as well as biological samples in the form of stool and peripheral blood; 2)
determined both microbiota taxonomy and gene function among these older adults; 3) utilized stool samples to
determine how the microbiome can induced intestinal inflammation and how this correlates back to observed
systemic inflammation; and 4) studied the microbiome metabolic product differences to explain how these
products can influence microglia functioning. This cohort is comprised of older adults clinical diagnosed with AD
(n=32), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n=48) or no cognitive problems (ND) (n=66). Among each of
these classes we have subjects that have improved their cognitive testing over time, remained stable, or declined
in cognition at different rates. Our central hypothesis is that there is a characteristic dysbiotic microbiome
among AD older adults and that the level of inflammation-type dysbiosis positively correlates with both local and
systemic inflammation and cognitive decline. Specifically, in Aim 1 we have been assessing characteristics of
the AD patient's microbiome in comparison to older adults with MCI or ND and longitudinally assessed the
microbiome composition and correlated it to changes in cognition. In Aim 2 we have been determining the extent
of microbiome dysbiosis among AD patients, correlating this with the level of induce in vivo/vitro epithelial
dysfunction, and then back to cytokine markers of inflammation and T cell population markers of
immunosenescence. Finally, in Aim 3 we have been performing metabolomics to identify metabolite profile
differences between AD patients, and both MCI and ND older adults and used identified metabolites in our in
vivo/vitro assays to describe its effects on microglial functioning. This supplement is requesting additional funding
to better characterize each group (AD, MCI, and ND) beyond clinical diagnosis and to include peripheral blood
markers that can identify the pathology associated with AD. Use of blood biomarkers aligns with the more
recently established NIA-AA Research Framework and movement in the field towards more biologic
characterization of AD. We plan to measure concentrations of Aβ peptides and phosphorylated-tau, as well as
ApoE proteotypes and neurofilament light chain levels from the peripheral blood. These biomarkers correlate
well with concentrations in CSF and PET imaging, which are expensive and impractical to perform for every
research participant. Our work is taking a critical step forward to bridge microbiome associations with AD to
causality by showing how the AD associated microbiome dysbiosis can lead to systemic inflammation,
inflammation-causing immunosenescence, and ultimately cognitive dysfunction. This additional funding would
greatly strengthen our current findings and add new insight into pathologic mechanisms."
11003504,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Candidate & Environment: The short and long-term goals of the candidate are to gain skills, knowledge, and
experience necessary to become a successful independent investigator in gene therapy for neuromuscular
diseases (NMDs) with respiratory pathology, such as Pompe disease. Duke University is the optimal location for
the candidate to achieve these goals with a world-renowned Pompe disease clinical and research center, along
with myology and gene therapy experts, who frequently collaborate and who host monthly research seminars.
Research: Pompe disease is a fatal glycogen storage disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding acid
α-glucosidase (GAA), which is responsible for hydrolyzing lysosomal glycogen. GAA deficiency results in
glycogen accumulation in the lysosomes of muscles (cardiac, skeletal, smooth) and motor neurons. The only
FDA approved treatment is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) of recombinant human GAA (rhGAA). ERT
effectively treats cardiac muscle glycogen accumulation but cannot completely correct skeletal muscle pathology
due to disrupted autophagy. In addition, ERT cannot cross the blood-brain barrier to treat motor neurons, and
therefore, respiratory failure persists. Thus, to prevent respiratory distress in Pompe patients, there is a need for
therapies that can clear glycogen and repair autophagy in the respiratory muscles and motor neurons. The
overall goal is to identify novel adjunctive therapies to improve respiratory muscle and motor neuron
pathology in Pompe disease. We propose to administer three autophagy activators which can cross the blood-
brain barrier and assess their therapeutic impact on the motor unit of Pompe mice (Gaa-/-). Acute intermittent
hypoxia (AIH), rapamycin, and recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) gene therapy are potential therapies
to treat Pompe disease, which will be evaluated across three aims. Each therapeutic has a unique and
complementary ability to address autophagy, a critical component of Pompe disease cellular therapy, in key
respiratory muscles and motor neurons. (1) Hypoxia is an activator of the autophagosome initiation complex.
Additionally, AIH induces neuroplasticity in respiratory motor neurons in neurogenerative disorders. (2)
Rapamycin is currently administered to Pompe patients as an immune suppressor, however, rapamycin also has
a direct negative impact on master metabolic regulator, mTORC1, thus activating autophagy. (3) rAAV-GAA
provides the deficient enzyme, thereby reducing glycogen and improving lysosome health which is a key to
restoring normal autophagy. In the final aim of this proposal, we will combine rAAV-GAA therapy with AIH and
rapamycin to determine the cumulative effect. Key methods of analysis include neurophysiology to assess neural
output of respiratory nerves, whole body plethysmography to assess respiration, molecular proteomics analysis
for autophagy pathway proteins, and immunohistochemistry to identify cellular architecture of muscle and CNS.
These novel interventions are already used in clinical trials and have the potential to quickly translate to clinical
care in Pompe patients suffering from respiratory distress."

Neutralizing titer is a demonstrated correlate of protection across most viral pathogens. The traditional assay to
assess neutralization titer is the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), which is generally regarded as
slow, subjective, and variable. To conduct large scale clinical vaccine trials, thousands of serum samples from
vaccinated individuals are typically assessed in neutralization assays, a scale that is difficult to achieve using
live virus in high containment facilities. Optical reporters such as GFP and luciferase encoded in ‘reporter
viruses’ are an alternative to PRNT and are more streamlined, safe, and scalable than PRNT assays but still
require a week of experimentation. Here we propose to develop a Rapid Reporter Virus (RRV) to assess virus
infection and neutralization rapidly and safely. The development of this novel assay is in direct response to our
customers’ requests for a better neutralization readout."
11004865,"Introduction
This purpose of this proposal is to request supplemental funding for the UAB/Tuskegee FIRST Partnership
(U54-CA267746-000538702) to cover costs for travel and lodging expenses for faculty hired under the
program (Benjamin-Carver FIRST Scientists) to attend the annual FIRST Grantees Meeting. Our request
covers the duration of the project period. Outlined below are A) the justification for this request, B) the
recruitment plan/timeline, C) the budget justification for the requested funds.
A. Justification
Support for FIRST faculty travel and lodging to the FIRST Annual Grantees Meetings was not originally
included in RFA or the Notice of Award for U54-CA267746-000538702. Consequently, our existing award does
not include funds for travel and lodging expenses for our Benjamin-Carver FIRST Scientists to attend the
FIRST Annual Grantees Meetings. Because attendance at the annual meeting is an expectation of the FIRST
faculty hires, this supplement will provide the funding necessary to cover these expenses.
B. Recruitment Plan and Timeline
Benjamin-Carver Scientist Recruitment and Hiring Process
Within the overall research theme of Health Disparities, our recruitment and cluster hiring focuses on four
research areas where health disparities are particularly evident: Cancer, Obesity/Diabetes, Cardiovascular
Disease, and Neuroscience. Having 12 total positions allows the UAB/TU FIRST Partnership to hire four
clusters of three junior faculty across these areas of opportunity. Across the two institutions, our goal is to hire
9 faculty at UAB and 3 at Tuskegee.
The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), through the Heersink School of Medicine (HSOM), has used
“coordinated hiring” in the past, but both UAB and Tuskegee University (TU) are newcomers to cluster hiring or
targeted recruitment to attract diverse faculty in specific research thematic areas. We utilized the Education
Advisory Board’s playbook for effective cluster hiring to ensure successful integration of all necessary
elements. This helped us plan our process and guaranteed that we were including all important program
components like inclusion of stakeholders and sustainability. To support this initiative, the UAB HSOM
provided the experienced staff and infrastructure to lead the recruitment, using its Office for Strategic
Recruitment team to coordinate the search. Doing so provided uniformity in the process and experience for
recruits and provided the resources and knowledge to create a high-quality recruitment experience for
candidates.
Application review and candidate selection are done through the Recruitment and Selection Committee. The
Recruitment and Selection Committee is primarily responsible for placement of position announcements and
sharing of the position announcement through multiple appropriate channels. In order to attract diverse
applicants, we are intentional in our recruitment, applying traditional and non-traditional strategies. We make
special efforts to advertise new positions in venues that have greater reach among women and minority
candidates, including professional organizations and social media (LinkedIn, Facebook) for underrepresented,
minority, and women scientists. In addition to placing ads in scientific journals, research-specific publications,
and research conference publications, we engage diverse faculty networks and research organizations
enriched for African American, Latinx, and female members (e.g., Association of Black Cardiologists, American
Medical Women's Association, Executive Leadership in Academic Medicine, NIDDK’s Network of Minority
Health Research Investigators). As we begin Year 3 and recruitment for our second cohort of scientists, we
have updated the language in some of our social media ads to reflect the specific clusters and research focus
areas we are targeting to complete our cluster hiring plan and to fill the cohort.
All position announcements include language outlining the details of the FIRST Cohort, including
the rationale behind cluster hiring, review criteria, and a summary of the cohort support resources and
activities. Announcements have inclusive language designed to broaden the pool of potential applicants.
All applicants are required to submit a statement of diversity outlining their efforts/experience at promoting
diversity and inclusive excellence. The announcement makes clear that the statement of diversity will be
heavily weighted during the selection process.
As applications are received, they are reviewed by the Recruitment and Selection Committee and the most
meritorious applications are selected for the interview stage. After a virtual interview is completed, the
Committee recommends candidates that are most promising to proceed to departmental review. These
candidates are chosen based on their record of research with a focus on health disparities, potential for rapid
advancement in their field, and potential for helping to promote inclusive excellence in research at both UAB
and Tuskegee. The Committee, in collaboration with the MPI team, decides on potential primary departments,
discusses the applicant with the department, and forwards the application for departmental review. The
potential primary department then follows their normal review and interview process and informs the MPI team
whether they would like to hire the applicant. Then, in a collaboration between the UAB/TU FIRST program
and the department, an offer is made to select candidates.
Recruitment Goals
The UAB/TU FIRST Partnership hiring plan is organized in clusters under the theme of health disparities. The
first year of the project period was spent planning and beginning our recruitment promotions. Interviews for the
initial wave of hires were held after the start of Year 2. During Year 2, 68 interviews were held with 7 FIRST
Benjamin-Carver Scientists hired, 6 at UAB and 1 at Tuskegee. We have 5 open positions remaining: 1 in
Cancer, 2 in Obesity/Diabetes, and 2 in Cardiovascular Research. Within these, we are looking to fill 2
additional positions at Tuskegee University and 3 at UAB. At present, one offer letter is in process for a
second hire at Tuskegee in the Cancer Cluster. Please see Table 1 for details.
We are now actively recruiting and reviewing applications for the remaining 5 positions, with an emphasis on
completing each of our clusters. Since the start of year three we have held four interviews. There are currently
four more being scheduled and applications continue to be received and reviewed. Our goal is to complete
interviews and extend offers for the remaining positions by Summer, 2024. All Scientists hired in this second
round will start by August, 2024 and will be fully onboarded by September, 2024. Therefore, we anticipate up
to 12 of our scientists (multiple potential scientists at varying stages of interviewing or hiring process in addition
to our 7 existing Scientists) will attend the 2024 FIRST Annual Grantees Meeting, with all 12 attending in 2025
and 2026.

10979839,"Project Summary
Lipoproteins are dynamic complexes of lipid and protein in the circulation that are correlated with
cardiovascular events. Lipoprotein particles can interact with over 100 different proteins in the
circulation. However, except for a few core lipid-binding proteins (apolipoproteins), the functional
implications of these protein-lipoprotein interactions are not known. We found that about 20% of
lipoprotein-associated proteins are protease inhibitors. Proteases are enzymes that cleave other
proteins and they play important roles in many physiological pathways. In atherosclerosis, their activity
is often associated with inflammation and unstable lesions that may be more prone to rupture. Because
lipoproteins accumulate within atherosclerotic lesions and these particles are enriched with protease
inhibitors, we propose that lipoprotein-associated protease inhibitor activity may be a novel mechanism
by which lipoproteins can suppress vascular inflammation and stabilize atherosclerotic lesions.
 Alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) is an abundant plasma serine protease inhibitor that is detected on
both low density and high-density lipoproteins (LDL and HDL, respectively). AAT is an endogenous
inhibitor of neutrophil elastase, a protease generated by neutrophils and macrophages within
atherosclerotic lesions. Our central hypothesis is that lipoproteins can modulate AAT function and this
contributes to lipoprotein-mediated effects on atherosclerosis by influencing vascular inflammation. Our
preliminary data suggest a unique structural interaction between AAT and lipoproteins that results in
functional preservation of AAT activity. Aim 1 of our proposal will investigate this structure-function
interaction in detail and will determine the mechanistic basis for this observation on LDL and HDL.
These studies will utilize cross-liking mass spectrometry and detailed in vitro functional assays. The
literature and our preliminary data support a potential role of AAT in various cardiovascular diseases,
however, the mechanistic contribution of AAT to vascular inflammation in atherosclerosis has not been
studied. Aim 2 will determine the role of lipoprotein-associated elastase-inhibitor activity in vascular
inflammation and atherosclerosis using in vivo mouse models of atherosclerosis. Furthermore, we have
developed a novel lipoprotein-targeting elastase-inhibitor peptide for synthetic enhancement of
lipoprotein-associated protease inhibitor activity. Aim 3 will utilize a newly generated AAT-deficient
mouse model to examine the impact of AAT on hepatic lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis. Together,
these studies will fill a significant knowledge gap in our understanding of how non-apolipoprotein
components of lipoproteins can impact atherosclerosis risk by modulating the antiinflammatory potential
of lipoproteins. This work will also develop new tools for enhancement of lipoprotein function and data
on the potential of this approach for atherosclerosis prevention or stabilization of high-risk lesions."
10981764,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The use of antibiotics in the first year of life has been recognized as a strong, consistent, and modifiable risk
factor for the development of asthma in childhood in numerous individual studies. However, a critical window
during which infant antibiotic exposure could have a greater effect on childhood asthma risk has yet to be
identified. Furthermore, whereas the results of some studies indicate that this association is likely due to
changes in the human microbiome, these studies have used techniques that are unable to accurately identify
relevant bacterial species or their function, which is critical to design interventions to prevent the long-term
detrimental effects of infant antibiotic exposure. To address these multiple knowledge gaps, the goals of this
proposal are 1) to determine the age when infants are most susceptible to the harmful consequences of
antibiotics on childhood asthma risk, 2) to examine microbial pathways through which infant antibiotic exposure
could lead to childhood asthma, and 3) to identify early-life upper respiratory tract (URT) and gut bacterial
species, patterns, and/or products that could increase the resilience of these 2 microbial communities and be
protective for childhood asthma onset after infant antibiotic exposure. To achieve these goals, we propose the
following specific aims: 1) to test the hypothesis that the age of infant antibiotic exposure is inversely
associated with childhood asthma risk (aim 1), 2) to test the hypothesis that infant antibiotic exposure is
associated with changes in the taxonomic and functional profiles of the URT and gut microbiome throughout
the first year of life (aim 2A), and that these changes mediate the association of infant antibiotic exposure with
childhood asthma risk (aim 2B), and 3) to test the hypothesis that, among infants exposed to antibiotics,
specific taxonomic and functional profiles of the early-life URT and gut microbiome are associated with
childhood asthma risk. To accomplish our goals in an effective and cost-efficient manner, we will 1) capitalize
on the strengths of our prospective birth cohorts with distinct longitudinal study designs, comprehensive
information on infant antibiotic exposure, and serial sampling of the URT and gut, 2) leverage the cutting-edge
laboratory and bioinformatic pipelines that we have assembled for our numerous prior studies of the human
microbiome, and 3) build upon an ongoing and successful collaboration between experts in the field. Our
proposal is a stepping stone to address a critical and unmet need: how to protect children from the long-term
detrimental effects of infant antibiotic exposure. By identifying a critical window of opportunity to intervene, the
microbial pathways to target, and candidate probiotics and/or bacterial products, the ultimate goal of the
planned studies is to inform the design of microbiome-based therapeutics that can help deliver antibiotics
safely during early life and reduce the burden of childhood asthma."
10980709,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Biologic males and females often experience different outcomes during influenza infection. Sex hormones can
mediate the severity of an infection by altering innate immune responses and are one factor influencing sex-
dependent differences in infection outcomes. It has also been shown that hormones can impact virus replication
in human respiratory cells in a sex-specific manner. However, a systematic understanding of the mechanisms
linking hormone levels and biological sex to immunity, virus replication, and disease outcomes is lacking. This
research program will leverage predictive, mechanism-based mathematical modeling and network perturbation
algorithms to identify the mechanisms by which estradiol (E2), a major sex hormone, regulates the host response
during influenza virus infection. And as hormones effect biological males and females differently, we will
determine how the mechanisms linking hormone levels and host responses may differ between the sexes. In
Aim 1, we will identify the lung host responses that are regulated by estradiol in male and female, influenza-
infected mice. Detailed, temporal immunologic and transcriptomic data will be collected, the gene expression
data analyzed to identify potential E2-regulated pathways, and dynamical mathematical modeling applied to the
immunologic data to identify the immune mechanisms that are affected by hormone treatment. In Aim 2, human
respiratory epithelial cells and lung macrophages from male and female donors will be pretreated with estradiol
and then infected with influenza virus. The viral load, phospho-signaling and gene expression will be quantified,
and recently developed network-based perturbation analyses will be applied to identify the top gene expression
regulators. Validation studies will be performed on the top pathways and regulators to confirm their activity in the
context of influenza infection in vitro. In Aim 3, using immune cell depletion, knockout mouse models and
dynamical mathematical modeling, we will assess the role of monocytes in sex-specific, estradiol-regulated
immune responses during influenza infection, and determine how immune regulators identified in vitro impact
infection severity in vivo. Overall, this program will determine how E2 regulates the host response during
influenza infection in order to alter infection outcomes and reveal what aspects of E2 regulation are sex-specific.
Newly identified host factors and E2-regulated mechanisms are strong candidates for drug targeting and can
lead to improved treatment based on patient sex or circulatory hormone levels."

The proposed research will uncover new radical-based methodologies that facilitate the synthesis of
complex bioactive compounds. Organic radicals are highly reactive species with unique
chemoselectivities that complement canonical two-electron chemistry. Recently, the emergence of new
reaction strategies that leverage single-electron redox events and harness radical intermediates for the
selective functionalization of organic molecules has provided chemists with useful tools for solving
contemporary synthetic problems. However, the highly reactive nature of many organic radicals has
made it difficult to impart catalyst-control over the regio- and stereoselectivity of these fleeting
intermediates, especially when complex reaction systems are concerned. In the past funding period, we
developed new catalytic strategies that leverage the unique redox features of low-valent Ti complexes to
achieve redox-neutral and net-reductive transformations, and through catalyst innovation, we
demonstrated that free radical-mediated reactions can be made highly enantioselective. These promising
results prompted us to continue to invent novel catalytic and reaction strategies that can effectively
harness radical intermediates and provide powerful tools for solving a range of longstanding synthetic
problems. In the new funding cycle, we will build on our previous success while moving our research into
important new areas of inquiry. In the proposed work, we aim to advance new approaches that employ
radical-based catalysts or reagents to address prominent challenges in organic synthesis. The
transformations targeted in each project area are either currently unknown or significantly limited in
reaction scope or selectivity. Some of the specific reactions that we aim to develop are: site-selective
oxidation of alcohols, enantioselective oxidation of amides and ethers, oxidative synthesis of stereogenic-
at-phosphorous(V) compounds, site-selective amination, halogenation, and desaturation of alkanes, and
deconstructive functionalization of alcohols. In-depth studies using canonical physical organic and
electroanalytical techniques will provide insights into the reaction mechanisms that will be used to guide
optimization. Ultimately, the realization of these proposed transformations will represent a significant
advance for the field of organic synthesis and support innovation in the synthesis of biomedically
important molecules."

The alarming 339% increase in the incidence of explicit racial discrimination (e.g., threats, unfair treatment due
to one’s race) experienced by Asian Americans since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic is of high public
health significance given its robust associations to alcohol-related problems, depression, and physical health
outcomes (e.g., poor sleep) among minority groups including Asian Am. While important strides have been made
in understanding the link between explicit racial discrimination and numerous health outcomes, it is a complex
process encompassing at least 3 different types of racial discrimination: explicit, internalized and vicarious.
Internalized racial discrimination refers to inculcation of racist stereotypes, which for Asian Am. includes the
model minority stereotype and self-devaluation of oneself and one’s race. Vicarious refers to observing,
witnessing or hearing about other Asian Am. being a target of racism. Although internalized and vicarious racial
discrimination have been found to have similar adverse health consequences as explicit racial discrimination,
what remains unknown is: how different types of racial discrimination distinctly and transdiagnostically impact
daily (moment by moment) and prospective health trajectories among three potentially high-risk and vulnerable
Asian groups: U.S.-born Filipino, Korean and Indian Am. The theory of “weathering” illustrates how the
cumulative effects and burden of racial discrimination creates allostatic load on the body and consequently
undermines current and future health. We will conduct a 36-month longitudinal measurement burst design study,
using bi-annual surveys with 900 18–19-year-old U.S-born Filipino, Korean and Indian Am. from the community
and campus, and apply ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methods with a nested subsample (n=180).
The age group 18-19 years represents a critical developmental period as problematic alcohol and other drug
use (AOD), depression, and anxiety emerge and peak during this time. We will identify cultural resilience-
promoting factors including ethnic/racial identity dimensions and universal factors (social support and coping)
that buffer the negative effects of racial discrimination. AIM 1a: Identify and characterize the developmental
trajectories of alcohol use and other drugs (AOD) use, mental health (depression, anxiety, PTSD), and physical
health (sleep, general health) over the course of 36 months. AIM1b. Establish how explicit, internalized, and
vicarious racial discrimination are associated with the trajectory classes of AOD, mental health, and physical
health. AIM 2: Identify cultural resilience-promoting and universal factors that moderate the effects of explicit,
internalized, vicarious, and cumulative exposures to racial discrimination on health outcomes. AIM 3 will establish
the real-time contribution of different types of racial discrimination on daily and next day alcohol use, mood, and
sleep using EMA. Study findings will offer novel insight about Asian Am. during this unprecedented time of
ongoing racial discrimination concerns and its cumulative and negative long-term health effects on these
marginalized and underserved groups."
10981741,"Abstract
End-stage kidney disease patients on in-center hemodialysis (HD) experience a substantial symptom burden,
which is associated with poor health-related quality of life (HRQOL), hospitalizations and mortality. Fatigue,
pain and depression are among the most debilitating symptoms, reported by more than 60%, 50% and 20%
of patients, respectively. Despite the significant prevalence and impact of these symptoms, treatment options
remain limited. The management of symptoms has been identified as a high research priority advocated by
patient advocacy groups and in both the National Institute of Health's scientific workshop and Kidney Disease
Improving Global Outcomes conferences. Recently, we successfully completed a randomized controlled trial,
Technology Assisted Stepped Collaborative Care (TĀCcare), to test an intervention to improve symptom
burden among 160 diverse patients on HD from Western Pennsylvania and New Mexico. Our intervention
had unique strengths that included targeting symptom cluster (fatigue, pain and depression), a shared
decision-making approach for pharmaco- and/or cognitive behavioral-therapy (CBT), stepped approach for
treatment, telemedicine delivered CBT in dialysis units, and a collaborative care model that integrated
symptom management with patients' dialysis and primary care teams. Our results showed clinically significant
improvements in fatigue and pain, and small improvement in depression, after a 12-week intervention that
were sustained for 6 months, as compared to an attention control arm. The goal of this proposal is to
conduct a hybrid Type II effectiveness-implementation, cluster randomized trial of TĀCcare 2.0 facilitated by
dialysis staff in a real-world setting. The TĀCcare 2.0 intervention will build on successful design elements of
the original intervention, enhance depression management strategies and increase durability of effect by
incorporating monthly longitudinal telemedicine-delivered booster sessions to complete a total 12-month
intervention. This proposal leverages our team's experience, collaboration, unique institutional resources, and
stakeholder advisory board (dialysis unit leadership, staff and patients) input, and will recruit 424 diverse
patients from 36 dialysis units (diverse in academic affiliation, rural/urban location) in Pennsylvania, New
Mexico, Tennessee, Alabama, Nebraska and New Jersey. We aim to 1) evaluate effectiveness of TĀCcare
2.0 in reducing fatigue, pain or depression (co-primary outcomes) after 12-week intervention compared to
usual care in HD patients (Aim 1); and 2) examine implementation barriers and facilitators at patient, provider
and organizational levels using Practical Implementation Sustainability Model (PRISM) based mixed-methods
(Aim 2). If successful, this study will provide transformative evidence and a blueprint to dialysis clinics and
policy makers for an integrated, scalable intervention and a set of implementation strategies and facilitation
toolkit to deliver interventions for improving symptom burden and meaningfully changing clinical care for
patients on HD."
10980934,"Hemolysis is one of the critical pathogenic mechanisms of pulmonary hypertension (PH),
predisposing individuals with hemolytic conditions to PH. Notably, 10-30% of sickle cell disease patients
and up to 80% of thalassemia patients develop PH, starkly contrasting to a mere 0.001% prevalence
in the general population. Moreover, our recent findings indicate significant correlations between
elevated sub-clinical hemolysis in Group 1 PAH patients and PAH severity. However, the critical
mechanism of heme actions leading to PH progression still needs to be understood. By elucidating the
impact of heme on the pulmonary vasculature, we aim to shed light on the contribution of heme-
mediated mechanisms to the pathogenesis of Group 1 PAH.
 Our previous studies demonstrated that the free heme directly triggers intracellular signaling in
endothelial cells by activating the MKK3/p38 pathway. However, the precise mechanism by which free
heme activates this signaling axis remains to be determined. Our search for heme-sensor factors
identified a Heme-Activating Protein (HAP1) responsible for sensing the heme and initiating heme
target genes in Yeast. The homolog of HAP1 in humans is the INAVA, known to be responsible for
triggering an immune response in macrophages and disrupting the barrier in epithelial cells.
 However, there is a gap in knowledge on the molecular mechanism of INAVA action in
endothelial cells and its involvement in hemolytic complications and PH pathogenesis. Based on our
compelling preliminary data, we introduce INAVA as a novel intracellular heme-sensor protein activating
MKK3/p38-mediated signaling by engaging 14-3-3 kinase. Notably, both INAVA and 14-3-3 are
overexpressed in the lung tissues of PAH patients and have increased interaction, implying a disease-
related signaling role. We aim to examine the hypothesis that free heme, by binding to INAVA, induces
14-3-3 activation in the cytosol. This increases endothelial proliferation, barrier dysfunction, and
cytokines, leading to PH pathogenesis.
 Our research effort, focused on investigating endothelial cell heterogeneity using a single-cell
approach, allowed us to discern the distinct pulmonary endothelial cell populations, each possessing
unique gene signatures and functional arrays. We found five novel populations of general capillary ECs,
named gCapA-E, in addition to well-known pulmonary arterial, venous, lymphatic endothelium, and
aerocytes. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that heme possesses a differential effect
on each of these endothelial cell populations, compromising the maintenance of adequate endothelial
barrier by gCapA, impairing angiogenic properties of gCapC, and altering proliferation of gCapB."

The Health Research (HR) Core of the Center for Clinical & Translational Research at the University of South
Carolina (CLINTRUSC) serves as the hub for the Pilot and Developmental (P&D) Project Program. HR Core
support of P&D projects is critical for 1) growth of CLINTRUSC’s clinical research workforce and 2) advancing
clinical and translational (C&T) research that serves the needs of the communities in the Midlands of South
Carolina (SC). In concert with the Studies Review & Support Unit (SRSU) of the Administrative Core (AC), the
HR Core will oversee every aspect of the P&D program from solicitation of P&D project proposals to
dissemination of study findings that result from P&D projects. The HR Core will be led by two senior investigators
(Drs. Bonilha and Murphy) with strong records of attaining extramural funding in complementary research areas
(clinical and pre-clinical, respectively). As Leaders of the HR Core, they will work together to bridge the
translational gap between basic and clinical research. A Project Manager and a Compliance Manager,
responsible for the day-to-day operations of the HR Core, complete the HR Core team. The overall goal is to
establish a robust C&T science program with a focus on diseases that affect populations in the Midlands of SC.
To achieve this goal, the HR proposes three specific aims: 1) encourage collaboration between investigators
across different disciplines and at different career levels; 2) provide funds for P&D projects for CLINTRUSC
investigators to generate preliminary data for extramural applications; 3) develop procedures for ongoing
oversight of the P&D project program. The HR Core will work closely with the AC, the Professional Development
(PD) Core, the Community Engagement and Outreach (CEO) Core, and the Research Design, Compliance, and
Data Management (RDCD) Core to ensure that CLINTRUSC investigators have the support and infrastructure
needed to successfully complete their P&D projects. The AC is the management and governance entity of the
CLINTRUSC overseeing all operations. The PD core provides an intensive mentoring program to ensure that
P&D awardees receive support in mentoring and grant writing so that their P&D projects are transformed into
successful extramural awards. The RDCD provides guidance in study design, statistics, and data management
as well as compliance. The CEO will facilitate recruitment and retention, notably including special populations.
Interactions between CLINTRUSC Cores will ensure that every P&D awardee receives all necessary support to
ensure the success of their projects. The HR Core has established metrics to define success and evaluation of
these metrics and the HR Core at large will be assessed annually by CLINTRUSC Directors, the Cores Review
and Support Unit, and the External Advisory Committee. The goal of the HR Core is to permit the emergence of
a cadre of strong, diverse, adequately mentored and comprehensively supported translational research
investigators. Overall, the HR Core will support the maximum growth of CLINTRUSC and generate C&T science
with the diversity and depth necessary to make an impact in the community we serve in the Midlands of SC."
10984301,"Humans are generally social and these social relationships can promote a healthier lifestyle and
increase longevity. Yet, when these social relationships are lost or come to an end, the perceived
social isolation and accompanying loneliness can lead to significant physiological, psychological,
and social consequences that impair an individual’s ability to function and greatly impairs their
quality of life. Although it is widely recognized that social bonds contribute to health, the
mechanism(s) by which social bond disruption translates into compromised mental and physical
health are not fully appreciated. An understanding of the biological substrates that drive social
bonds, and the negative sequelae following loss of social bonds, is essential to develop a
framework for pharmacological interventions to reduce health risks associated with loneliness.
The conditions and disorders associated with loneliness have each been linked to inflammation
and metabolic disruption. The proposed studies will determine the extent to which social bond
disruption engages inflammatory and metabolic substrates in the brain of a social species. Given
that the negative effects of loneliness are not simply ameliorated by the presence of other
individuals in humans, it is essential to examine the underlying protective mechanisms of social
bonds, and the biology engaged when bonds are broken, in order to develop interventions aimed
at optimizing physical and psychological outcomes for those lacking positive social support. The
overarching hypothesis of this line of inquiry is that the neural-glial response engaged by social
bond disruption increases neuroinflammation and compromises neural mitochondrial function
through disruptions in oxytocin (OT) signaling. Using the socially and genetically monogamous
California mouse (Peromyscus californicus), we will determine the extent to which pair bond
dissolution increases the neuroinflammatory response to challenge and the extent to which
stress-related behaviors can predict the anticipated inflammatory response to pair bond
dissolution (Aim 1). We will also test whether pair bond dissolution disrupts synaptosome
mitochondrial function (Aim 2). Lastly, we will determine to what extent OT can ameliorate the
impact of pair bond dissolution on the neural-glial axis (Aim 3). The impact of social experiences
on the brain may be critical to understanding the biological drivers of mental health disorders and
neurodegenerative conditions, like Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias."
10989496,"Occupational silica exposure is linked with systemic autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody
(ANCA)-related vasculitis. The health burden is significant because systemic autoimmune diseases have been
reported in 6% of those employed in mining occupations, and 21% of those with severe forms of silicosis.
Although several novel animal models of systemic autoimmunity induced by exposure to crystalline silica (cSi)
exist, there is no experimental model in which cSi exposure results in inflammatory arthritis. This is a significant
barrier to our understanding of how occupational/environment exposures contribute to the development of
arthritis. The “mucosal origins hypothesis” argues that arthritis pathogenesis originates at mucosal sites and then
transitions to articular joints. Crucial to this is a pre-clinical phase of autoantibody production and chronic
systemic inflammation influenced by genetic susceptibility to systemic autoimmunity. Using BXD2 recombinant
inbred mice, which develop generalized systemic autoimmunity and erosive arthritis, we found that transoral
instillation of cSi led to an exaggerated serum anti-ENA5 autoantibody response followed by pronounced
synovial inflammation, cartilage damage, bone erosion, and pannus formation of ankle joints. The anti-ENA5
response is strongly associated with cSi induced systemic autoimmunity, suggesting that its induction contributes
to the aggressive nature of the inflammatory arthritis in the context of an appropriate genetic susceptibility. To
study the feasibility of the BXD2 as a model of cSi induced arthritis we propose two aims to define the relationship
between pulmonary exposure, systemic autoimmunity, and inflammatory arthritis. Aim 1 will address the
hypothesis that severe inflammatory arthritis in cSi exposed BXD2 mice depends on a cSi driven autoantibody
response that requires the autoimmune prone genetic susceptibility of the BXD2 to mature into a chronic
inflammatory response leading to severe inflammatory arthritis. The proposed studies will determine if genetic
predisposition is essential to development of cSi induced inflammatory arthritis. They will also examine the
relationship between cSi exposure, pulmonary inflammation, systemic autoimmunity, and inflammatory arthritis
to identify how immunological events occurring at a mucosal site relate to development of joint arthritis. In Aim
2 we will test the hypothesis that cSi particles find their way to joint spaces, resulting in localized inflammatory
events which are then aggravated by an already existing cSi induced chronic autoantibody response leading to
severe inflammatory arthritis. We will test this by asking if cSi particles can be found in ankle and knee joints,
and if intra-articular injection of cSi is sufficient for arthritis or if passive transfer of IgG from anti-ENA5 positive
cSi exposed BXD2 mice is necessary to enhance arthritis severity. Successful completion of these studies will
result in a novel experimental model of cSi induced inflammatory arthritis, and provide a better understanding of
how adverse immunological events at mucosal surfaces can impact pathology in distant tissues."
10989190,"ABSTRACT
Every year in the United States, over 35,000 newborns suffer from neurologic injury at the time of birth due to
hypoxia. Despite widespread use of cardiac external fetal monitoring (EFM) for the last 60 years, the rate of fetal
neurologic injury has not decreased, highlighting the urgent need for better assessment methods in labor.
Currently, clinicians still rely on cardiac EFM, which reflects a downstream effect of initial neurologic damage
due to interruptions in fetal oxygenation resulting in subsequent heart rate changes. Relying on downstream
effects can be inaccurate and result in both false positive and false negative diagnoses. Evaluating fetal brain
activity via fetal electroencephalography (fEEG) has been shown to be a promising method as it shows abrupt
signal changes up to ten minutes before cardiac EFM changes measured in fetuses with acidemia. These ten
minutes in delivering a fetus can be the difference between lifelong cerebral palsy and a developmentally normal
child. However, vaginal fetal EEG (V-fEEG), the only currently available method, is invasive, requiring vaginal
electrodes attached to the fetal scalp. Consequently, it has been abandoned as a monitoring method. Non-
computerized abdominal fetal EEG, which is non-invasive, has been proposed, but is uninterpretable due to
extensive signal artifact from non-EEG signals from the abdomen due to maternal and fetal movement, muscle
activity, and maternal and fetal electrocardiogram signal. Our work overcomes this challenge by harnessing
advances in artificial intelligence to identify and filter out non-fetal EEG signals, allowing fetal neurologic activity
to be accurately and non-invasively measured. We have developed an algorithm that has been refined and
applied to patients that shows classical fetal EEG response to auditory stimuli, or evoked brain stem potentials.
Using this algorithm, fetal EEG signals can be separated cleanly from maternal and other fetal noise. Our
hypothesis is that our method of computerized abdominal fetal EEG (cAb-fEEG) can rapidly and accurately
reconstruct fetal neurologic activity and is equivalent to invasive V-fEEG monitoring. To test this hypothesis, we
will first compare our method of cAb-fEEG to direct V-fEEG in a group of 46 patients to quantify reconstruction
error (regression residuals) between the signals. Second, neurology clinical experts in EEG interpretation will
evaluate the neurological features of both cAb-fEEG and V-fEEG. To achieve these aims, we have assembled
and will lead a team of experts in EEG research, electrical and computational engineering, clinical neurology,
obstetrics, and pediatrics. We expect the results of this study will formally provide a strong base for cAb-fEEG
and lay the foundation for future clinical studies to evaluate cAb-fEEG as a monitoring method to improve
perinatal outcomes. The results of this research will provide a non-invasive and novel method to directly measure
fetal neurologic activity and have the potential to decrease the rates of preventable brain injury at birth."

Single cell genomic technologies are fast evolving technologies capable of measuring a variety of omics data
modalities in individual cells. With a wide range of applications such as discovery of new cell types, mapping
temporal and spatial cellular programs in development, tissues and organs, and studying cell-cell interactions in
tumor microenvironments, etc., these technologies are rapidly transforming biomedical research. Early single cell
genomic studies are primarily focused on characterizing how cells are different in a sample. Recently, however,
single cell studies increasingly produce a large number of biological or patient samples, creating new opportuni-
ties and growing demands for studying how samples are different and how omics programs are associated with
sample phenotype. Despite these new opportunities and demands, the sample-level heterogeneity represents
an extra layer of complexity not fully dealt with by existing data analysis methods.
 This proposal aims to develop new analytical methods and software tools to address three open challenges in
the unsupervised analyses of multi-sample single cell genomic data at population scale, across data modalities,
and across species. Our Aim 1 will address the challenge that longitudinal data with densely sampled time points
from the same patient are difficult to obtain for studying dynamic cellular programs along disease progression.
We will develop an alternative strategy and analytical method, sample trajectory analysis, to infer temporal pro-
gression of sample phenotype and its associated cellular programs using cross-sectionally collected samples.
Our Aim 2 will tackle the problem of integrating data across samples and modalities to allow analyses of sample
similarities and differences. We will develop a systematic sample harmonization method to address challenges in
harmonizing data with unmatched features, choosing optimal feature type and resolution, and removing unwanted
technical noises while keeping meaningful biological variation. We will also create an analytical framework to sup-
port systematic unsupervised analysis of sample heterogeneity. Our Aim 3 will develop a solution to comparative
analysis of multi-sample single cell data across species which is important for identifying conserved and diverged
biological processes between human and animal models. Such knowledge is fundamental for designing and
interpreting animal model experiments for studying human diseases.
 Upon completion of this proposal, we will deliver our methods through open-source software tools. These
tools will be widely useful for analyzing single cell genomic data with multiple samples. By addressing several
major challenges in single cell genomic data analyses, our new methods and tools will help unleash the full
potential of single cell genomic technologies for biomedical research and can have a major impact on advancing
our understanding of both basic biology and human diseases."
10994436,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Transformation of normal cells to cancer cells involves complex changes influenced by oncogenes, inactivation
of tumor suppressors, and disrupted signaling pathways, imposing a metabolic demand that is sustained through
alterations in critical metabolic pathways and the availability of nutrients in the tumor microenvironment to support
tumor expansion. Previously, we have shown that the electron transport chain (ETC) is necessary for in vivo
tumor initiation and progression. However, the exact reasons behind the crucial role of the ETC in tumor growth
remain somewhat unclear. We hypothesize the ETC supports tumor growth by maintaining oxidative tricarboxylic
acid (TCA) cycle activity by replenishing NAD+ and converting succinate to fumarate for production of lipids,
nucleotides, heme, and glutathione. However, a comprehensive understanding of the TCA cycle's importance
in tumor growth has not been achieved thus far. Hence, we chose to focus our investigation on malate
dehydrogenase 2 (MDH2), a key enzyme involved in the final step of the TCA cycle, to explore its significance
in tumor growth. MDH2 has two distinct functions involving conversion of malate to oxaloacetate and cytosolic
NAD+ generation through the malate-aspartate shuttle. Preliminary data, demonstrates that the absence of
MDH2 impaired orthotopic tumor growth of murine lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells in immunocompetent
mice. This proposal outlines our plan to further investigate the necessity of MDH2 in tumor initiation and
progression using a novel MDH2 floxed mouse line with the Kras+/LSL-G12D; Trp53fl/fl (KP) mouse model of LUAD.
Furthermore, as tumors progress, they become hypoxic concomitant with a decline in ETC function and
mitochondria NAD+ regeneration. Moreover, MDH2 plays a role in regenerating cytosolic NAD+. Thus, we will
address whether cytosolic or mitochondrial NAD+ acts as a limiting factor for LUAD in the KP mouse model. To
address this, we have also generated conditional mice expressing cytoplasmic or mitochondrial Lactobacillus
brevis H2O-forming NADH oxidase (LbNOX) enzymes, which convert NADH back to NAD+ in the cytosol or
mitochondria, respectively. To complement these experiments, we will perform CRISPR knockouts of MDH2 or
express CytoLbNOX and MitoLbNOX in orthotopic lung cancer mouse models using mouse cell lines derived
from the KP mouse model. A key set of experiments will assess whether MDH2 is required for normal alveolar
epithelial cell development and function in adult mice. These investigations will enhance our understanding of
the necessity of mitochondrial metabolism dependent TCA cycle and NAD+ regeneration in supporting lung
tumor growth and normal lung epithelial cell function."

The idea of evolutionary constraint is central to understanding of how populations have and will adapt(ed) in
response to heterogeneous selective pressures. Constraints therefore determine how organisms with relevance
to human health, like pathogens and cancers, adapt to different drugs, hosts, or environments. Constraints can
be formed by strict trade-offs, when mutations adaptive in one environment have antagonistically pleiotropic
costs in alternate environments, or by more dynamic processes, when the ability to select for hypothetically
possible costless generalism is limited by mutational accessibility, speed of selection, or ecological opportunity
for selection. These overlapping processes can make evolutionary constraint difficult to measure and these
different processes difficult to disentangle. Despite the centrality of constraint to evolutionary theory, these
difficulties mean that the processes forming constraints at different levels remain poorly understood—
leaving open questions about how they affect evolution.
In this proposal, I leverage high throughput microbial experimental evolution lineage tracking methods
that provide unprecedented power to measure the distributions of fitness effects for mutations in
multiple environments. These methods allow us to generate quantitative insights into the dynamics of
evolutionary constraint. Aim 1 will ask whether constraints in laboratory experimental evolution resemble
natural variation by measuring the joint distribution of fitness effects (JDFE) for natural isolates of S. cerevisiae
in two nutrient environments mimicking natural conditions (synthetic wine must and synthetic beer wort) and then
experimentally evolving a barcoded laboratory strain in these and an alternating media environment to determine
whether the laboratory evolved JDFE resembles the naturally evolved JDFE. Aim 2 will explore how
evolutionary constraints change over time by leveraging a rebarcoding system to experimentally evolve S.
cerevisiae in the same conditions as Aim 1 for 5 evolutionary `steps' (~400 generations) and measure the JDFE
at each `step'. Most laboratory experimental evolution examines shorter time scales, but we know from long-term
experiments and natural observations that evolutionary dynamics change over time as populations near fitness
peaks and/or change their environment. Thus, Aim 2 will allow us to quantitatively measure how constraints
change over time.
Through this work, I will build a powerful system for conducting high-throughput, long term evolution in multiple
environments. The proposed research will significantly expand my training in the areas of quantitative genetics,
population genetics, and molecular biology while encouraging increasing independence. It will therefore
compliment my PhD training in evolutionary ecology to allow me to build an integrative research program
that links genetic, evolutionary, and ecological processes to understand how constraints determine eco-

Post-translational modification (PTM) by phosphorylation plays an important role in protein folding, stability, and
function. In bacteria, protein phosphorylation plays a key role in bacterial physiology and virulence gene
regulation (pathogenesis) by participating in signal sensing and transduction networks. Protein phosphorylation
occurs predominantly on six amino acids, and they form different chemical bonds. Phosphorylation of serine,
threonine, and tyrosine residues forms a stable ester bond. Phosphorylation of aspartate and histidine forms a
relatively unstable phosphoramidate P-N bond. These two types of phosphorylation are predominantly involved
in signal transduction and gene regulation. On the other hand, phosphorylation of the arginine residue (Arg) is a
novel mode of PTM recently discovered in Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Mycolibacterium
smegmatis. In these organisms, Arg phosphorylation occurs in >100 different proteins and is involved in protein
quality control, translational, and transcriptional regulations. Despite the importance in the bacterial physiology,
nothing is known about Arg phosphorylation in Streptococcus, a medically important genus. We found that in
Streptococcus mutans, a dental pathogen, Arg-phosphorylation occurs; however, the homolog of the B. subtilis
and S. aureus Arg-kinase (McsB) is conspicuously absent in streptococci. The major goals of this study are to
understand the physiological role of Arg-phosphorylation in S. mutans and to identify the putative kinase enzyme
responsible for Arg-phosphorylation in streptococci."

Antibodies play a pivotal role in the adaptive immune system due to their ability to specifically bind to a diverse
array of antigens. There are two structurally diverse forms of antibodies that have arisen throughout evolution:
1) immunoglobulin (Ig)-based antibodies, which are found in gnathostomes (i.e., jawed vertebrates); and 2)
variable lymphocyte receptor (VLR)-based antibodies which are found in agnathans (i.e., jawless vertebrates).
Gnathostomes generate Ig-based antibodies by two diversification methods. Primary diversification of Ig-based
antibodies occurs via V(D)J recombination where the variable antigen-binding exon is assembled from various
gene segment options to generate a diversity of binding specificities in developing B lineage cells. Secondary
diversification of Ig-based antibodies occurs through somatic hypermutation (SHM) which is mediated by
activation induced cytidine deaminase (AID) in activated germinal center B cells (mammals) or B cell-rich
lymphoid structures early in life (chickens). Agnathans have an alternative form of leucine rich repeat
(LRR)-based antibodies called variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs). While there are many convergent
properties of Ig and VLR antibodies, there has been no evidence of SHM in VLRs despite the existence of a
homolog to AID in lamprey, which opens doors to evaluate the impact of Ig- and LRR-based structures in
tolerating diversification through an SHM-mediated protein-variation mechanism. Preliminary computational
data suggest that the diverse structures of Ig- and LRR-based antibodies may vary in their capacity to maintain
structural integrity during hypermutation, a process crucial for the expression of antibody diversity. These
results are consistent with a hypothesis that structural stability constraints may play a role in real-time protein
mutability potential. This proposal will test that hypothesis that Ig-based antibodies are more mutationally
tolerant than LRR-based antibodies, with two specific aims: (i) determine the mutational tolerance of Ig-based
and LRR-based antigen receptors in vitro, and (ii) define diversity and maturation of Ig and VLR substrates in
vivo. Aim 1 will evaluate the ability for large mutation libraries of sets of three Igs and three VLRs to continue to
be expressed and bind antigen. Aim 2 will compare VLR diversification and affinity maturation to a single chain
immunoglobulin-based antibody (i.e., VHH) to immunogens in vivo. The expected outcome of this proposal will
be to (i) deliver biophysical insights into the aptitude of evolutionarily distinct but functionally convergent
adaptive immune receptors for mutation-driven diversification, and (ii) begin to inform optimal substrate design
receptive to mutation-library-driven biotechnological evolution of biomedically relevant substrates."

There are few effective treatment options for smoking cessation. The identification and validation of reliable
biomarkers for tobacco use disorder has the potential to greatly facilitate treatment development and improve
clinical outcomes. Attentional bias, a behavioral correlate and potential biomarker of addiction, is consistently
observed in nicotine users and is related to the risk of subsequent relapse following smoking cessation. Our
group has developed and tested a novel virtual reality (VR) nicotine cue exposure paradigm with promising
preliminary results, including obtaining large nicotine-related attentional bias effect sizes. Thus, the goal of the
proposed project is to validate the attentional bias neurophysiological marker derived from the VR Nicotine Cue
Exposure paradigm (VR-AB) as a biomarker of tobacco use disorder and investigate its potential as a predictive
marker and candidate surrogate endpoint for use in the development of novel pharmacologic interventions for
smoking cessation.
To achieve the goals of this project, 200 daily tobacco cigarette users will be assessed on the VR Nicotine Cue
Exposure paradigm then pseudo-randomized (matched on age and sex) to receive varenicline or placebo (n per
group=100). Following eight days of titration, participants will be assessed again on the VR Nicotine Cue
Exposure paradigm at target dose of varenicline (1 mg twice daily). They will then be followed via mobile
assessments for eight days on the target dose to assess short-term nicotine use behaviors. Varenicline will be
used as a pharmacological challenge to validate the VR-AB marker given this medication’s proven ability to
attenuate nicotine craving/cue salience and reinforcement.
In accordance with NIDA’s Notice of Special Interest on Biomarker and Biotypes of Drug Addiction (NOT-DA-
20-012) and the FDA’s Biomarkers, EndpointS, and other Tools (BEST) resources, the broad aims of the
proposed project are to: (1) validate the reliability of the VR attentional bias (VR-AB) marker and estimate the
VR-AB effect size as moderated by varenicline, (2) evaluate VR-AB as a predictive biomarker for response to
varenicline, and (3) evaluate VR-AB as a candidate surrogate endpoint by assessing the predictive validity of
the VR-AB biomarker on short-term nicotine use behaviors as moderated by varenicline."

 Radiotherapy is a cornerstone of treatment for prostate cancer, but radiation-related genitourinary (GU)
and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities can negatively impact quality of life among survivors. Radiotherapy can
damage the bladder and rectum leading to gross bleeding, inflammation, pain, fibrosis, and when severe, life-
threatening complications. Up to 20% of men treated with radiotherapy for prostate cancer develop mild to
moderate late GU and/or GI toxicities that are often permanent and negatively impact quality of life; up to 5%
develop severe or life-threatening effects requiring medical or surgical intervention. Radiation exposure drives
risk of late toxicity, but genetic predisposition is a significant contributor and can explain why some patients
develop toxicity while others no not despite identical treatment plans. Our prior work shows that late GU and GI
toxicities are polygenic in etiology, with risk modified by the combined effects of many low-penetrance single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), raising the attractive possibility of using a polygenic risk score to identify
susceptible patients prior to starting radiotherapy. Towards this goal, we developed a novel machine learning
approach to combine information from many risk SNPs and dose-volume parameters into a radiogenomic (ML-
RGx) risk score. Our preliminary data shows that this modelling approach out-performs existing methods and
shows promise for use in the clinic. The proposed project will apply this method to a large training dataset from
the NCI-supported International Radiogenomics Consortium to build ML-RGx models of GU and GI toxicity that
will then be externally validated using data and biospecimens from two large phase III radiotherapy trials
completed through the NRG Oncology cooperative group. Bioinformatic approaches will be applied to prioritize
SNPs for inclusion in the modelling and to uncover biologic pathways underlying genetic predisposition to normal
tissue injury. The study has three aims: (1) to train ML-RGx models for each of radiation-induced GU and GI
toxicity and define a threshold for low and high risk; (2) to validate ML-RGx models in two independent datasets
from NRG Oncology cooperative group trials; and (3) to assess feasibility and impact of ML-RGx models on
treatment planning workflow in a Radiation Oncology clinic. This work will bring personalized medicine to the
field of radiation oncology and improve prostate cancer care. Our innovative modelling approaches will also
uncover important molecular pathways that could be targeted with interventions to prevent and/or mitigate
toxicities."

The long-term vision of this proposed research is to build the next generation of methods to put medicine into
the brain and solve the most challenging and impactful neurological diseases. We plan to achieve this by
addressing the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the most significant barrier to delivering medicine to the brain.
Specifically, we aim to achieve cell type-specific control of the BBB by installing magnetic “switches” that would
allow therapeutic molecules across this barrier (
MagnetoBBB). This idea is based on two of our recent studies.
First, we have found that increasing intracellular calcium levels can change the BBB permeability, defined as the
ability of drugs to cross from the blood to the brain, based on our related studies using lasers and nanoparticles
to overcome the BBB. Second, our recent work on Ferritin-iron Redistribution to Ion Channels (FeRIC) has shown
the ability to induce calcium signals by producing biochemical signals and is safe in several cell types. In this
proposed work, we aim to establish the feasibility of cell-type specific modulation of the BBB with FeRIC and
magnetic field for drug delivery into the brain. To achieve these goals, we propose two specific aims. First, we
will investigate and optimize the BBB control using a human brain microvascular endothelial cell line or in vitro.
The in vitro system allows us to optimize and express the FeRIC constructs on the microvascular cell line for
magnetic field stimulation. We will characterize the calcium and calcium-induced signals inside these cells. We
will further determine the BBB changes by measuring the electrical resistance across a cell monolayer consisting
of these cells and the ability of molecules to cross the monolayer. Second, we will study the ability of
MagnetoBBB to control BBB inside a rodent brain or in vivo. We will first deliver the FeRIC genes into the
microvascular endothelial cells using viral and nonviral methods. We will then investigate the magnetic field
strength and duration needed to change BBB permeability in live brains. Our proposed approach will offer several
significant advantages over existing technologies. First, MagnetoBBB offers a physiologically-like mechanism to
modulate endothelial calcium levels and BBB permeability. Second, it allows non-invasive and cell-type specific
modulation of BBB with tissue penetrating RF field. Third, MagnetoBBB uses broadly accessible technology
suitable for multiple drug dosages such as chemotherapy, as the inexpensive RF coil can be made portable and
easily accessible. Lastly, the magnetic BBB switch is compatible with various imaging methods such as MRI
imaging to monitor the BBB opening and brain function. This proposed exploratory R21 addresses the key
aspects for a longer-term effort in cell type-specific control of the BBB for brain therapeutics."

The coordinated expression of the nuclear and the mitochondrial genomes is critical for mitochondrial function;
yet, what regulates this process in humans is unclear. This coordination, termed mitonuclear balance, is
especially important for the biogenesis of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes,
which are composed of >90 proteins encoded by both the nuclear and the mitochondrial genomes. A significant
challenge in gene regulation is the synthesis of these complexes, as the two physically separate genomes must
coordinate their gene expression programs to produce the correct ratios of the subunits, ensuring proper complex
assembly and function. The imbalanced production of OXPHOS subunits can be detrimental to the cell; orphan
subunits and assembly intermediates lead to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, which can lead to
mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial disorders, including neurodegeneration and metabolic conditions.
Using a FACS-based CRISPR screen developed by our lab, we recently discovered that metabolism-related
factors play a role in the balanced expression of OXPHOS complex IV subunits in human cells, thus linking
certain aspects of cellular metabolism to mitonuclear balance. The overall objective of this proposal is to identify
novel factors that regulate OXPHOS protein biogenesis and determine their mechanism of regulation. The
central hypothesis is that diverse aspects of metabolism influence the expression of the two genomes across
compartments for balanced OXPHOS protein synthesis. In Aim 1, I will investigate the function of MMADHC, a
protein involved in vitamin B12 metabolism, and which is a putative regulator of complex IV subunit synthesis. I
will determine the role of MMADHC on OXPHOS protein biogenesis and mitochondrial health, its impact on
transcription and translation of OXPHOS subunits, and its role in establishing critical metabolite pools. In Aim 2,
I will use our CRISPR/FACS screen to individually knock-out ~3000 metabolism-related genes, and identify
genes whose loss leads to imbalanced expression of dual-origin subunits of complex I. I will determine the gene
regulatory roles of the top hits, and whether they are regulators of complex I subunits specifically, or of OXPHOS
complexes in general. I will conduct the proposed research at Harvard Medical School, in the lab of Dr. L. Stirling
Churchman, who is an expert on nuclear and mitochondrial gene expression and who has developed a variety
of sequencing technologies for studying the different levels of gene regulation. This proposal is part of a
comprehensive professional training plan to prepare me for a career as an independent research scientist
investigating coordination of gene expression across the nucleocytosolic and mitochondrial compartments, and
its dysfunction in disease and development. With the completion of the proposed work, the results will uncover
general pathways involved in mitonuclear balance, with a focus on diverse aspects of cellular metabolism.
Additionally, the detailed investigation into putative regulators may identify gene targets for therapies for
mitochondrial disorders."

Despite major advances in heart transplant patient management, 1 and 5-year survival rates for
heart allografts have remained static over the last decade. Advances, and cost reduction, in
various genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomics and other omic technologies over the
last decade, and the scaling of deep phenotyping and electronic health records affords unique
opportunities for precision medicine.
In this proposal we outline a number of key multiomic molecular studies and integrative
analyses to bridge the genome and dynamic physiology in cardiac transplant patients. We aim
to diagnose and prognosticate acute allograft rejection and to assess the impact of biomarkers
of post-transplantation complications including acute rejection, from the various omics across
using ‘integrative personal omic profiling’ (iPOP) developed by investigators in our team. We
outline a transformation advance in the molecular diagnoses of acute cardiac allograft rejection
within the formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) heart allograft biopsy samples, which may
change the current standard-of-care which uses conventional histopathology grading alone.
We will also assess how genetic polymorphisms impact other omic profiles in the same-, and in
subsequent-, timepoints from the same individuals through to post-transplantation complex
phenotypes such as acute rejection. We aim to investigate how genetic variants in the HLA and
minor histocompatibility (mHA) regions impact clinically relevant post-transplantation outcomes
including acute rejection and patient survival."

The vast majority of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is sporadic, with aging being the biggest risk factor. Yet age-
related changes within neurons that can facilitate AD pathogenesis remain elusive. Intriguingly, there is an
intricate link between aging and cell polarity. Dysregulation of polarity is observed in many cellular contexts
during aging, such as increased permeability of epithelial barriers, defective asymmetric division of stem cells
and increased frequency of cancer. Similarly, dysregulation of cellular polarity and compartmentalization
are observed in AD neurons, with redistribution of axonal tau to the somatodendritic compartment and
progressive loss of synaptic contacts. However, the mechanisms underlying this polarity dysregulation remains
unclear. Remarkably, several recent genetic studies have identified PARD3, encoding the polarity protein
partitioning defective 3 (Par3), as a potential novel risk gene for AD and related tauopathies. In addition, our
recent work revealed Par3 shows significantly reduced expression by middle-age, and a further loss of Par3 is
observed in human AD brains. Loss of Par3 increases compartmentalized APP/BACE1 convergence of
amyloid precursor protein (APP) with its β-secretase BACE1, leading to intracellular β-amyloid (Aβ)
accumulation. Moreover, we found forebrain conditional knockout (cKO) of Par3 leads to age-dependent tau
pathology and cognitive decline, and loss of Par3 results in autophagosome accumulation, all prominent
features of AD brains. Finally, phosphoproteomic profiling in Par3 cKO hippocampus reveals changes in
microtubule binding proteins that are important for neuronal polarity. These exciting data have led to our
central hypothesis that polarity dysregulation in aging brains leads to microtubule-based membrane
transport defects that contribute to cognitive impairments in AD. Specifically, we hypothesize that loss of
Par3 disrupts compartmentalized microtubule dynamics, leading to defects in polarized endolysosomal
trafficking and autophagic flux in AD neurons. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that loss of Par3 in AD disrupts
polarized endolysosomal trafficking through differential regulation of dendritic and axonal microtubules. Aim 2
will test the hypothesis that loss of Par3 causes defects in autophagy and restoration of Par3 ameliorates AD
pathologies. Our studies will utilize advanced molecular imaging techniques, including tauSTED super-
resolution imaging, FRET, FRAP, and optogenetic manipulations of cellular and molecular activities. We
combine different molecular imaging approaches with biochemical and phosphoproteomic analyses, as well as
behavioral analysis in novel Par3 conditional knockout and Par3 conditional knockin mouse models. Taken
together, our proposed studies will establish the molecular mechanisms by which loss of Par3 in the aging
brain contributes to cognitive deficits in AD progression and whether restoring Par3 expression can ameliorate
AD pathologies. The results will shed light on the mechanism of sporadic AD in which aging is the major risk
factor and polarity dysregulation may be a common feature."

Black and Latinx gay and bisexual men are at highest risk of comorbid conditions resulting from HIV.
Cardiovascular disease has become the leading contributor to mortality among persons with HIV, as both
conditions are often co-morbid. This is due to chronic inflammation, as a result of HIV, which increases CVD
risk. As a result, prominent HIV comorbid conditions also include high blood pressure and type II diabetes
mellitus. Compared to the general population, CVD risk is 1.5 to 2 times higher in people with HIV, and this risk
increases with age. By the year 2030, an estimated 78% of persons with HIV will be 50 years old or older, and
nearly 80% will have one or more chronic conditions. Increased risk of HIV-related comorbidities, such as heart
disease are due to racism, discrimination, and homophobia, and inequitable social determinants that drive
CVD risk (nicotine exposure, diet quality, low physical activity, insufficient sleep, high cholesterol levels, blood
pressure, blood sugar, and body mass index). Even when HIV viral load is well-controlled, HIV-infection
causes immune activation and chronic inflammation, which can cause a narrowing of blood vessels, and can
result in high blood pressure, chest pain, and/or buildup of plaque in the heart, ultimately resulting in heart
disease. The status quo as it pertains to traditional chronic illness prevention has been conventional patient
teaching in the clinical setting. However, prevention efforts to thwart heart disease have not reached
acceptable levels to have a population impact, and have mostly fared better in heterosexual, non-minoritized
populations. The LEARN Study is a pilot waitlist control trial to test a virtual environment as prevention
education in Black and Latinx sexual minority men with HIV. Our LEARN findings suggested that Black and
Latinx sexual minority men with HIV are concerned about HTN, T2DM, CVA, and cancer. Cancer risk was due
to the increased risk of cancers, other than AIDS-defining illnesses, among people with HIV as well as risk for
cardiovascular-related comorbidities. We propose a follow-up study to these findings in LEARN 2 using an
innovative clinical/community-based partnership, an equity-focused multidisciplinary team, with a culturally
salient and tailored virtual environment to preemptively mitigate HIV-related comorbidities with shared risk
factors that disproportionately affect Black and Latinx sexual minoritized men. Project objectives are to: 1) to
utilize formative research to modify our intervention to address the social determinants of health that impact
prevention of shared clinical risk factors for HIV-comorbidities; 2) determine the efficacy of LEARN2, as
prevention education for HIV-comorbidities; and 3) to conduct a process evaluation of LEARN2 feasibility and
acceptability and determine which intervention components are most successful in initiating change. This
project represents a shift in the status quo and signifies a trailblazing effort that leverages a multidisciplinary
team, virtual tools, and clinical/community-centeredness to advance health equity in diverse, sexual minority
populations, while informing research, clinical practice, and policy."

As one of the most common pregnancy complications, nearly 600,000 women in the United States suffer from
postpartum depression annually. Consequences of postpartum depression are far-reaching and include
maternal suicide, functional impairment, and impaired development and psychiatric illness in offspring. Despite
the high prevalence and significant consequences, under current treatment paradigms less than 16% of
women with postpartum depression receive treatment and only 3.2% in total achieve remission. Treatment
uptake in this population is influenced by concerns regarding pharmacotherapy during lactation and caregiving
demands for a newborn. Novel treatments that remove the significant obstacles to accessing care inherent to
the postpartum period, such as non-pharmacological therapies delivered in-home, are urgently needed. Within
the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domain of arousal/regulatory systems, the circadian timing system and
its alignment with the sleep-wake cycle—called the phase angle difference—represents a promising novel
treatment target. Morning bright light therapy advances circadian timing and is an effective antidepressant for
seasonal and non-seasonal depression. Importantly, bright light therapy is a non-pharmacological intervention
that is administered in-home. However, its efficacy in postpartum depression, and mechanism of action, have
not been established. This administrative supplement is proposed for a parent a randomized controlled trial of
wearable bright light therapy relative to dimmed light placebo for postpartum depression. Inspired by emerging
evidence that implicates light sensitivity as a novel treatment mechanism for light therapy in seasonal affective
disorder, we now have a unique opportunity to leverage ongoing data collection by testing light sensitivity as a
treatment mechanism for wearable morning light therapy in postpartum depression. The aims of the
administrative supplement are as follows: AIM 1: Compare light sensitivity pre- to post-treatment between
women with postpartum depression assigned to bright light therapy (n=15) and dimmed light placebo (n=15).
AIM 2: To evaluate associations between light sensitivity and depression symptoms at pre-treatment, as well
as changes in light sensitivity and changes in depression symptoms from pre- to post-treatment. This project
will be the first to test preliminary effects of wearable bright light therapy on light sensitivity in postpartum
depression, associations between light sensitivity and postpartum depression symptoms, and whether changes
in light sensitivity are associated with changes in postpartum depression symptoms. It will lay the foundation
for understanding novel treatment mechanisms of light therapy, an important step towards personalized
medicine approaches for postpartum depression."

Status epilepticus (SE) is the most common serious neurological emergency among children worldwide. In the
low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) of sub-Saharan Africa, the burden of childhood SE-associated
mortality and morbidity appears to be especially high. However, the phenotypes of childhood SE, clinical
predictors of SE-associated mortality and of SE-associated neurodevelopmental morbidity, and genomic
predictors of SE, SE-associated mortality and neurodevelopmental morbidity have not been well-characterized
in this region. The clinical and genomic predictors of benzodiazepine-resistant SE, which is common and may
contribute to SE-associated mortality, have also not been well-characterized, especially among African
children. A large percentage of children (~80%) with SE in northern Nigeria experience SE as their first
seizure, and the estimated incidence of childhood SE in Kano is relatively high. Little is known of the clinical
and genomic risk factors for the development of epilepsy among African children who experience SE as their
first seizure. The H3Africa consortium is yielding insights into the genomic factors of common human diseases
across the African continent and and will provide controls for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of SE.
This project, Childhood Status Epilepticus and Epilepsy Determinants of Outcome (SEED), will establish a
large cohort of children with SE in Kano, northern Nigeria who present to pediatric emergency rooms in Kano.
Innovative capacity building will include the incorporation of point-of-care EEG and EEG-video in large
pediatric emergency rooms in Kano, performed by specially trained community health extension workers
(CHEWs) who will be trained in both basic epilepsy care and EEG technology. A team of specialists working
together at Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital (AKTH) and at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) will
utilize video exams, EEG-video, detailed histories, and brain MRI to perform deep phenotyping on this large
cohort of children with SE. Clinical risk factors for in-hospital SE-associated mortality, short-term SE-
associated mortality, long-term SE-associated mortality, and SE-associated neurodevelopmental morbidity will
be determined. GWAS will be performed on the entire cohort, with gender matched controls from H3Africa,
through collaborations between AKTH, Bayero University Kano, the Sidney Brenner Institute for Molecular
Bioscience in South Africa, and VUMC. Genomic risk factors for childhood SE-associated mortality and
morbidity will be determined, as well as clinical and genomic risk factors for development of epilepsy among
children who experience SE as their first seizure and clinical and genomic risk factors for benzodiazepine-
resistant SE. SEED will provide valuable insights into childhood SE in sub-Saharan Africa."

Vibrio cholerae (Vc), the causative agent of cholera, colonizes the mucosal surface of the small intestine. Infec-
tion is mediated via virulence factors to penetrate the mucus layer, attach to epithelial cells, and proliferate, all
the while modulating interactions with both host cells and the gut microbiota. The human gut microbiota is
highly diverse, and interpersonal variation in the structure and function of the microbiota drives dramatic differ-
ences in Vc colonization. At the center of microbe-microbe and microbe-host interactions lies the host mucus
layer, comprised of secreted mucin glycoproteins including the dominant mucin MUC-2. Mucus provides at-
tachment sites and carbon sources for both pathogens and commensal members of the gut microbiota at the
interface of the epithelium and the gut lumen, as provides a key physical barrier to infection. However, the role
of mucin metabolism in metabolic interchanges between Vc and specific configurations of the gut microbiota,
and the resulting impact on personalized Vc infection outcomes, has not been well studied. Here, we show that
TagA, a secreted metalloprotease upregulated by the Vc virulence master regulator ToxT, promotes Vc growth
in mucin, and that TagA is a bifunctional protein, acting as both mucinase and a mucus secretagogue that in-
duces host mucin production. Using a combination of ex vivo tissue culture and in vivo gnotobiotic mouse
colonization models combined with TagA mutants lacking either proteolytic activity or MUC2-inducing activity,
we found that TagA’s two activities have different effects on Vc fitness during infection depending on the pres-
ence of specific human gut microbes. We have generated model gut microbiota characteristic of human gut
microbiota states: one model microbial community similar to that of healthy individuals, which promotes Vc in-
fection resistance, and another model microbiota characteristic of the dysbiotic state found in cholera endemic
areas associated with high susceptibility to Vc colonization. TagA mucolytic activity is important for Vc infection
resistance within the colonization-resistant microbiota, while the mucin-inducing activity of TagA FN3 leads to
increased Vc infection within dysbiotic communities. Therefore, we hypothesize that Tag drives Vc metabolic
interactions with specific gut microbiota leading to community-specific attachment, growth, and overall infection
outcomes. We will test aspects of this core hypothesis in four specific aims. Aim 1 will elucidate mechanisms
driving mucin-dependent interactions of Vc with commensal gut microbes in epithelial attachment and growth.
Aim 2 will examine how personalized gut microbiota structure in cholera endemic areas modulates mucin- and
TagA-dependent disease phenotypes. Aim 3 will determine how TagA-microbiota interactions drives produc-
tion and metabolism of host mucins. Finally, Aim 4 will elucidate the role of proximity and spatial specificity in
driving microbiota-dependent Vc disease outcomes. The ultimate goal of this application is to shed light on the
role of pathogen-mediated mucin metabolism in microbial interactions during enteric infection."

Antibiotic resistance is becoming a major public health problem worldwide, with antibiotic resistant pathogens
infecting hundreds of millions and killing over a million patients worldwide each year. Infections such as
pneumonia, tuberculosis, blood poisoning, gonorrhoea, and foodborne diseases are becoming harder or
impossible to treat with the existing medicine. Majority of antibiotics currently in clinical use are natural products
or their derivatives. However, recently discovery of natural products with novel mechanisms to kill pathogens
have become more challenging due to the high rate of rediscovery of known molecules, as the traditional
technologies only capture the highest abundant molecular products of microbial isolates. The introduction of
modern sequencing technologies and genome mining in early 2000 has revolutionized the field of natural product
discovery. While these technologies have revealed millions of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs, clusters of
genes that encode for natural products) in microbial genomes, currently these methods cannot predict the
precise action of enzymes in BGCs, and therefore fail to correctly predict the final molecular product of BGCs.
Chemia Biosciences is developing technologies to predict the molecular product of these BGCs based on high-
throughput mass spectrometry data collected on extracts of microbial cultures. In the past, the PI and co-PI have
developed techniques for identifying known and discovering novel natural products by a computational analysis
of mass spectrometry data. The main goal of this proposal is to develop methods for discovering novel
antimicrobial polysaccharides and aminoglycosides, a biomedically important class of natural products that
include antibiotics streptomycin, gentamicin, neomycin, kanamycin and tobramycin. The software developed in
the course of this proposal will be available to partners as a cloud service."

The purpose of this proposal to demonstrate the feasibility of building a practical shim sub-system based on a
minimally interacting in-bore shim coil using a highly controllable power array for use in commercial MRI scanners
for multi-band neuroimaging and spectroscopy applications at high fields.
Over the past several years, the importance of improved B0 shimming for echo planar imaging (EPI) has been
recognized by several groups. Technical developments have focused on ways of providing higher spatial
frequency corrections and higher strength of local B0 corrections. Two methods of accomplishing those goals
were applied: 1) multi-coil (MC) arrays frequently utilizing DC-coupled RF coils or 2) very-high order shim (VHOS)
inserts based on spherical harmonic (SH) symmetries. Also, for the human brain, optimizing the B0 shim
corrections on a slice-by-slice (SBS) basis was demonstrated to significantly improve homogeneity. Because of
this, several groups have developed dynamic updating approaches, including strategies to mitigate artifacts due
to eddy-current effects associated with dynamic shim updating (DSU). It has been demonstrated that the use of
VHOS inserts based on 4th order SH can provide superior shim performance to sparse MC arrays for both static
and dynamic shimming. It has also been demonstrated that theoretically and experimentally VHOS inserts can
achieve MB=2 with equivalent homogeneity to SBS with significant gains over whole brain shimming maintained
up to MB=4. Thus, a new VHOS insert technology capable of distinct corrections at up to 3 or 4 spatially disparate
slice locations simultaneously with equivalent performance to SBS shimming enabled by DSU technology will
greatly improve performance of MB EPI and other sensitive techniques.
To achieve the goal of up to MB=4 we will leverage our recent work on second generation 7T scanners. The
goal of this Phase I proposal is to demonstrate an optimized prototype of easily installable digitally controlled,
real-time multiband shimming system for Siemens Terra 7T implementation with commercialization in Phase II."
11004868,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Prostate cancer (PC) is the most common cancer in men, and the second leading cause of cancer death among
men in the United States. There is a critical unmet need to develop novel, efficacious therapeutics for PC. NUAgo
Therapeutics, Inc. is developing an RNA-interference-based therapeutic for PC based on research conducted at
Northwestern University into a naturally occurring anti-cancer mechanism. This research identified a class of
short (19-22 nt long) double-stranded (ds) interfering RNA molecules (here termed “sRNAs”) that potently target
genes that are essential for cancer cell survival. These sRNAs are derived from CAG trinucleotide repeat (TNR)
sequences that are found in genes associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, including huntingtin
(the cause of Huntington’s disease) and the androgen receptor (AR) gene (the cause of spinobulbar muscular
atrophy [SBMA]/Kennedy disease). Both diseases are associated with reduced cancer incidence. Evidence
indicates that CAG expansions lead to increased production of short interfering RNAs that bind to complementary
transcripts and downregulate their expression. sRNAs containing the CAG repeat (“sCAG”) are extremely toxic
to cancer cells by targeting highly expressed CUG repeat-containing genes, providing both a mechanistic
explanation for the reduced incidence of cancer in patients with certain neurodegenerative diseases and a novel
therapeutic approach for cancer treatment. PC is a particularly attractive target for this novel therapeutic
approach. The number of CAG repeats in the AR gene is inversely correlated with PC incidence, the
aggressiveness of the disease, and the risk of distant metastasis. Longer CAG repeats thus appear to have an
anti-tumor effect, suggesting susceptibility of PC cells to sCAG. The goal of this STTR project is to develop an
sCAG-based therapeutic, which will be delivered to cells using lipopolyplex (LPP) nanoparticles, to treat PC. In
Aim 1, the uptake and activity of sCAG-LPP (“NU002”) will be evaluated in mouse models of prostate cancer,
quantifying both sCAG delivery and silencing activity in PC cells in vivo. Uptake and activity of the NU002 and a
non-toxic control sRNA will be evaluated in both tumor and normal cells in four mouse models, including two
xenograft models of PC and a syngeneic PC model. Uptake will be monitored by fluorescently labeling the
sRNAs, while silencing activity will be measured using a fluorescent reporter gene that includes a corresponding
target sequence. RNA sequencing will be used to measure the expression of target genes in tumors. In Aim 2,
the anti-tumor effects of NU002 will be characterized in vivo in the same four xenograft and syngeneic models
as in Aim 1, measuring the effect on excised tumor size at 4-6 weeks post-treatment. Histological and liver
enzyme analyses will be used to examine toxicity in normal tissues, and RNA sequencing will again be performed
on tumor and normal tissue samples to quantify the expression of targeted genes. This Phase I work will provide
proof-of-concept data supporting future work that will focus on preclinical IND-enabling studies and formulation
development in preparation for a first-in-human clinical trial."
10980711,"Project Abstract:
Efficient vertebrate nervous systems require the precise insulation of central nervous system (CNS) axons by
myelinating oligodendrocytes. However, we know very little about how axons are selected for myelination and
why some CNS structures are avoided. We set out to investigate these questions and identified several genes,
including junction adhesion molecules 2&3 (jams 2&3) and transmembrane protein 125b (tmem125b) as putative
regulators of CNS myelin targeting and growth. Tmem125b is expressed in mature, myelinating oligodendrocytes
in zebrafish, mice, and humans with an expression pattern that is consistent with its possible role in myelin
targeting and myelin maintenance and jams 2&3 are expressed in neurons and oligodendrocyte lineage cells. In
our preliminary studies, we have discovered that mutations of tmem125b as well as jams 2&3 cause ectopic
myelination of CNS neuronal soma, consistent with a role for these proteins in myelin targeting and/or growth.
In this application, we will extend these findings to: 1) determine the role of tmem125b in CNS myelination (Aim
1), 2) characterize the role of jams 2&3 in developmental myelination (Aim 2), and 3) identify the binding partners
for Tmem125b that inhibit ectopic myelination to neuronal soma (Aim 3). When complete, we will have a deeper
understanding of the role of tmem125b and jams 2&3 in CNS myelination as well as insight into the mechanisms
that drive appropriate myelin targeting during development."

The most important unmet need in oncology is to overcome the lack of effective therapy for advanced solid
tumors in adults and children. Despite major advances in immunotherapy, radiation therapy, precision medicine,
and nuclear medicine, the vast majority of advanced solid tumors presenting clinically today are still incurable.
Radiotheranostic therapies offer the tremendous advantages of precision medicine and patient selection over
other cancer treatment modalities but lead to objective responses in only 30-60% of patients. Innovations in
radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) to address the major barriers to consistent tumor control are sorely needed:
suboptimal drug delivery and lack of retention of radionuclides at the target site. For cancer, RPT is administered
as an unconjugated or chelated radionuclide or in combination with a delivery vehicle, such as a peptide or
antibody (radioimmunotherapy). This project aims to develop a highly versatile RPT platform that harnesses
engineered bacteria to concentrate therapeutic radionuclides in tumors. We hypothesize that an engineered
bacterial fusion protein can serve as an in vivo artificial receptor for a small radionuclide carrier (as anti-2,2′,2”,2”'-
(1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetrayl)tetraacetic
acid
(DOTA)-radiohapten). This construct, DOTA-
binding Salmonella, can specifically colonize tumors following intravenous administration and is cleared via the
liver and spleen. Notably, bacteria do not colonize in the radiosensitive red bone marrow or kidneys, which are
typically organs-at-risk during RPT. Based on the known pharmacokinetics, biodistributions, and clearance
properties of engineered bacteria, the DOTA-radiohapten can be injected precisely at the time of peak bacterial
tumor-to-normal tissue accumulation ratios (eg, after 48 hours, tumor-to-spleen ratios of 104 are typical). The
intratumoral bacteria will capture the DOTA-radiohapten and plasma DOTA-radiohapten will be rapidly and
efficiently excreted from the body via the renal route.
This project has two Aims. In Aim 1 we will genetically engineer Salmonella to express surface-anchored DPB
characterize its functionality in vitro. In Aim 2, we will demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed radio-theranostic
treatment paradigm based on Salmonella-DPB + 86/90Y-DOTA in mouse tumor models. This strategy has several
specific advantages over other radioimmune approaches. The number of radiohapten (DOTA) binding sites per
gram of tumor has the potential to be orders of magnitude greater than the number of the surface-marker sites
on cancer cells. The strategy will produce unprecedented therapeutic indices for critical organs (tumor vs.
kidneys and bone marrow) because Salmonella are cleared from the blood hours after injection, and
accumulation in the kidneys is minimal. Salmonella,
engineering
 with its high tumor specificity, deep tissue penetration, and
plasticity, make it a highly promising for RPT.Engineered Salmonella, combined with in vivo capture
of safe, non-immunogenic, bioorthogonal DOTA-radiohaptens, offer a highly promising engineered bacteria
radiotheranostic platform for oncology."

The human herpesviruses are responsible for lifelong debilitating and congenital infections, and some members
of this family are associated with human cancers. HSV causes significant disease during acute infection and
establishes persistent latent infections in sensory neurons for the life of the host leading to reactivation and
recurrent disease. This proposal is based on a series of observations about the interplay between HSV infection
and the intrinsically antiviral cellular protein, PML. In response to interferon treatment, oxidative stress, DNA
damage, and viral infection PML oligomerizes to form a mesh-like spherical shell around heterogeneous, phase-
separated nuclear condensates, called PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs). PML oligomerization leads to the
activation of its SUMO ligase activity, which in turn induces the recruitment of dozens of cellular proteins that
contain SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs) including repressors of gene expression into PML-NBs via SUMO/SIM
interactions. PML-NBs are anti-viral, however, the exact mechanism of their action remains poorly understood.
PML-NBs size and number increase in response to HSV infection, and they are actively targeted for degradation
by HSV1 as a mechanism to counteract their antiviral effects. During HSV infection PML-NBs have often been
observed adjacent to the sites of viral DNA replication and have recently been shown to entrap the entire viral
genome.
Despite a rudimentary understanding of these processes, many questions remain about how PML-NB formation
is triggered by HSV infection and how they are recruited to viral genomes. Oligomerization and sumoylation of
PML have been shown to be essential for the effective formation of PML-NBs in response to stress. In Aim 1
we will identify PML domains that are necessary for its SUMO-E3 ligase activity and required for
formation of the PML-NBs. One of the most surprising aspects of PML-NB formation is their ability to form
around and entrap viral DNA, resulting in genome silencing. The properties of PML that promote this unusual
ability to recognize viral DNA are not understood. In Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that PML contains a
DNA-binding domain necessary for recruitment of PML-NBs to viral genomes. Together, these aims will
probe the fundamental mechanisms behind the two key events that trigger the formation of PML-NBs in
response to HSV infection."

 Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by a progressive increase of pulmonary
vascular resistance and obliterative pulmonary vascular remodeling that result in right heart hypertrophy,
failure, and premature death. The underlying mechanisms of loss of capillary endothelial cells (ECs) and
obliterative vascular lesion formation remain unclear. Our preliminary data showed that arterial
programing was evident in human PAH patients and rodents. We hypothesize that general capillary ECs
program to arterial ECs through HIF-2α-Cdk19/Sox17/Notch4 signaling which contributes to the
pathogenesis of PAH. Completing our proposed study will provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the
effective treatment of PAH in patients."

Bipolar cells (BCs) are the first interneurons in the retina and are responsible for sampling photoreceptor output
and distributing it to ON and OFF streams. Each BC subtype collects and transforms different salient components
of the visual scene (luminance, frequency, contrast, etc.), yet the specific mechanisms different subtypes use to
process this information into functional channels remain elusive. This proposal focuses on the CBC2 (Type 2
OFF cone bipolar cell). In addition to its conventional role processing photoreceptor output for downstream retinal
ganglion cells, the CBC2 is the primary recipient of inhibitory crossover inhibition from AII amacrine cells and
provides the majority of glutamatergic feedback onto AIIs, positioning it as an important mediator of bidirectional
signaling between ON and OFF steams across the retina. This project will characterize distinctive and novel
physiological features of CBC2s to determine their unique contribution to retinal function. My preliminary
experiments have identified three particularly interesting features of CBC2s that have not been seen in ON-BCs.
I hypothesize that CBC2s, and perhaps OFF-BCs in general, possess unique mechanisms that are likely
fundamental to their role in the retina. This proposal will examine each feature through three primary aims.
Aim 1 will use electrophysiology, pharmacology, and super-resolution immunofluorescence microscopy to
identify and characterize a postsynaptic glutamate receptor in CBC2 dendrites that may augment conventional
excitatory input from photoreceptors. Aim 2 will combine patch-clamp electrophysiology with time-resolved
membrane capacitance measurements to examine the consequences of microdomain control of vesicle
exocytosis on short-term plasticity and the voltage-dependence of exocytosis. Finally, Aim 3 will investigate
reciprocal glycinergic feedback between CBC2s and AII amacrine cells and use Ca2+ imaging and computational
modeling to create a biophysical model of glutamate release from CBC2s. Combined, these experiments
represent the first comprehensive examination of the biophysical properties of the mammalian CBC2, a vital step
in determining the role it plays in retinal function. While the von Gersdorff lab has a proven and published record
in the realm of retinal biophysics, my proposal will require learning diverse and novel techniques, such as super-
resolution microscopy and computational modeling, for which I have sought specialized training from outside my
lab. I have carefully assembled a mentorship team to provide me with the technical expertise and dedicated
guidance required to achieve my planned scientific aims and further my professional goal of a career in academic
research."

Despite major advances over recent decades, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a leading cause of death
in the USA and globally and risk for factors that predispose to CVD remain incompletely understood. Although
symptomatic food allergy is relatively uncommon in adults, nearly 1 in 5 adults make IgE antibodies to food that
can be detected in circulation; the majority of those with IgE antibodies are unaware of the IgE, do not have
symptoms related to food and routinely consume the foods to which they make IgE. We recently published
findings from a study of 4996 adults in the National Health and Examination Survey (NHANES) with replication
in 960 adults in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) that showed a significantly increased risk of
CVD-related mortality associated with IgE antibodies specific for cow’s milk. Although a novel observation,
these findings fit within an increasing body of evidence that inflammation, including Th2-related allergic
pathways, contribute to CVD development. The goal of this proposal is to expand our research in order to
address several important questions: i) do IgE antibodies specific for other food allergens also confer CVD
risk? ii) which specific subtypes or markers of CVD are associated with IgE to foods? iii) does consumption of a
food to which an individual is sensitized increase risk of CVD? To address these questions, we will
comprehensively assess the relationship between food antibodies and CVD mortality in the discovery sub-
cohort of MESA that we have previously studied (Aim 1), validate the findings of our preliminary data and Aim
1 in the entire MESA cohort, examining which CVD phenotypes are associated with food specific IgE and
whether consumption of allergen increases risk (Aim 2), and take advantage of an ongoing cohort of those
undergoing clinically indicated coronary CT angiography (CAVA-CCTA) to understand the relationship between
food specific IgE and atherosclerotic plaque. Together, these aims are designed to provide strong evidence in
support of our hypothesis that food sensitization, in a manner dependent on consumption, confers CVD risk.
Confirmation of our recently published findings would have high potential for clinical impact because they
suggest an opportunity for precision nutritional prevention of CVD, could change food allergy guidelines which
currently encourage those who have asymptomatic IgE to foods to consume the food, question whether oral
immunotherapy for food allergy could have unintended long-term consequences, and suggest a potential use
of anti-IgE therapies for CVD."

10995462,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: In the United States, more than 10 million women have reported
experiencing reproductive coercion (RC) by an intimate partner during their lifetime. This form of intimate
partner violence involves deliberate actions to undermine a person’s reproductive choices, such as forcing a
partner to continue or terminate a pregnancy or sabotaging contraception. Exposure to RC is increasingly
recognized as a critical mechanism contributing to the acquisition of sexually transmitted infections (STIs),
including HIV. Existing research demonstrates RC disproportionately impacts younger women aged 15 to 25,
women in unstable intimate relationships, those with lower socioeconomic status or educational attainment,
and racial and ethnic minorities. Despite these findings, a critical gap remains in examining social determinants
at community and policy levels associated with RC, including neighborhood socioeconomic status, healthcare
access, and state contraception policy. Furthermore, limited research exploring multiple levels of influence
makes addressing women's health information and support needs challenging. Guided by a social-ecological
framework, this F31 explanatory sequential mixed methods study aims to examine the role of social
determinants of health in RC and to identify potential targets for future intervention development and testing.
The specific aims are to (1) determine, through multilevel analyses, social determinants associated with self-
reported RC among women at high risk for STI/HIV (N=1,800) and (2) explore the influence of multilevel social
determinants on the health information and support needs of women reporting RC using a mixed methods
approach (N=30). These aims will be achieved by leveraging pre-existing data from the sponsor’s ongoing
national longitudinal epidemiological study (R01AI172469, Schnall/Johnson/Kempf, MPIs) to conduct multilevel
analyses to assess associations of social determinants contributing to RC prevalence, followed by recruiting a
subsample for freelisting and semi-structured interviews to explore women's experiences of RC. This study
responds directly to NINR's mission, emphasizing the importance of considering the influence of social
determinants to optimize women's sexual and reproductive health and advance health equity. Conducting
this F31 study in coordination with proposed formal training activities will facilitate the PI’s training in (1)
reproductive coercion, (2) health equity, (3) multilevel modeling and statistical analysis, (4) mixed methods
design, and (5) professional development. Supported by a sponsorship team with expertise in mixed methods
design (Schnall), STI/HIV prevention (Schnall), reproductive health equity (Hall), and collaborators with
expertise in intimate partner violence (Glass) and multilevel modeling and statistical analysis (Liu), this
proposal provides rigorous training critical to the PI’s career goal of becoming an independent, interdisciplinary
nurse scientist with a research program dedicated to advancing sexual and reproductive health equity."
10978958,"Percent mammographic density (PMD) is one of the strongest risk factors for, and is considered an intermediate
marker of, breast cancer. Recent wide spread uptake of digital mammography, and advances in image analyses
have identified additional mammographic features including texture variation (gray-scale and spatial variation)
in breast density and deep learning-based risk scores that predict breast cancer risk independent of PMD.
Because of the strong associations with breast cancer risk there is a need to identify potential modifiable risk
factors of mammographic features. Differences in breast cancer risk by socioeconomic status (SES) have long
been established, as well as observations of spatial variation in the US. It has become clear that social
determinants of health (SDOH), have an impact on health conditions including cancer. Healthy People 2030 has
identified five key domains of SDOH that impact health: economic stability, education, health care, neighborhood
environment, and social/community context. Additionally, there is a small, but growing body of evidence
suggesting a role of environmental exposures (e.g., air pollution) with breast cancer risk and mammographic
features. However, most studies have examined the health effects associated with one environmental exposure
or SDOH at a time, ignoring that individuals experience multiple exposures simultaneously. Also, few studies
have been able to assess changes in mammographic features over the menopausal transition.
 Using the resources of the nationwide prospective Nurses’ Health Study 3 (NHS3), we are uniquely
positioned to study the complex associations of multiple environmental exposures and SDOH on mammographic
features predictive of breast cancer. NHS3 is an open cohort currently consisting of 33,780 active US female
nurses and nursing students (mean age at enrollment 34.0). To date 12,891 participants (38.2%) reported having
at least one mammogram. We propose to collect and analyze digital mammographic images from 4,000
participants selected to maximize diversity in age, race and ethnicity, and region of residence. This proposal
takes a comprehensive approach to understanding the impact of demographic factors, SDOH and a wide range
of environmental factors including air pollution, UV, radon, on mammographic features.
 The specific aims are: (1) determine how multiple environmental exposures, demographic factors, and
SDOH are associated with mammographic features, and (2) with change in mammographic features from pre-
to postmenopause; and (3) determine the joint associations of environmental and SDOH characteristics with
baseline PMD and imaging features and change of the same.
 We expect our findings to provide valuable information on the role of modifiable exposures on
mammographic features and thus, subsequent breast cancer risk. These findings will provide valuable
information for individual- and population-level prevention, risk assessments, and policy decisions, with the long-
term goal of reducing the burden of breast cancer."

Undiagnosed Diseases (UD) are constellations of clinical findings evaluated specialists see over time without determining their cause(s) and for which diagnostic procedures and tests have been exhausted. The NIH NINDS Diagnostic Centers of Excellence for the UDN provides an exciting opportunity to increase the reach of UDN to a broader patient population in an efficient manner utilizing a tiered evaluation approach combined with iterative data analysis with an overarching goal of improving the diagnosis, care, and understanding of patients with UD. To this end, we propose establishing the Vanderbilt Center of Excellence in Undiagnosed Diseases (VCEUD). We formed our VCEUD by leveraging 1) a strong clinical team of Pediatricians, Internists, Endocrinologists, Psychologists, Immunologists, Rheumatologists, Neurologists, and Geneticists; 2) institutional strengths in bioinformatics, phenomics, structural biology, and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches such as Large Language Models (LLM) and Natural Language Processing (NLM); 3) institutional resources such as the BioVU DNA databank and its experts, PheWAS, MedWAS, VICTR-Studios, and REDCap database system, 4) VUMC’s Recruitment Innovation Center (RIC) to establish mutually beneficial relationships with community collaborators that serve populations with health disparities, 5) education and training of the next generation of physicians that will help sustain our program over the long-term, and importantly 6) significant institutional funding. The goal is to improve community engagement, efficiency, diagnostic rate, and development and dissemination of novel methods. We will increase our outreach efforts to populations facing health disparities. We will consider genetic and non-genetic etiologies and evaluate cases in our tiered diagnostic pipelines. For the genetic diagnostic stream (GDS), we analyze genomic data using a multi-omics approach to generate clinical and gene hypotheses and merge them to identify concordant disorders that cause undiagnosed diseases and discover new diseases. For the non-genetic diagnostic stream (NGDS), we leverage our VICTR-Studios to generate refined clinical hypotheses that are then tested by an in- depth clinical workup. We hypothesize that novel approaches in AI, phenomics, genomics, bioinformatics, structural biology, and experimental validation can be leveraged to more efficiently identify undiagnosed disorders that have proven difficult to solve with standard approaches. To do this, we will, 1) Increase recruitment, especially for populations with health disparities, by building a network of diverse community partners and equipping those partners with tools and resources, 2) Optimize efficiency and effectiveness of clinical evaluation of individuals with UD, 3) Determine the causes of challenging UD cases by integrating novel analytic and bioinformatics strategies with current methods into an efficient tiered iterative pipeline."

During inner ear development, multipotent otic progenitors give rise to mechanosensitive hair cells through a
series of cell-fate transition points. The transcriptional cascades dictating hair cell specification have not been
defined although a number of transcription factors essential for inner ear development have been identified.
Using a human pluripotent stem cell-derived vestibular organoid system that allows mechanistic investigation
due to its scalability, we performed a trajectory analysis of otic lineage cells using scRNA-seq. Our results
suggest that supporting cells are precursors of hair cells in human vestibular organoids. Additionally, we
identified LHX3 as a candidate hair cell driver gene, whose expression precedes ATOH1, a previously
perceived hair cell driver. Moreover, our transcriptomic analysis between human vestibular and cochlear
organoids revealed that NR2F1 is among the most differentially expressed genes in both otic progenitors and
hair cells in cochlear organoids than in vestibular organoids. Based on these findings, we propose a series of
experiments to define the role for LHX3 and NR2F1 in hair cell and cochlear specification, respectively. In Aim
1, using a longitudinal single-cell multi-omics approach, we will test if supporting cells are primary hair cell
precursors in human cochlear organoids and if LHX3 is a pioneer transcription factor that promotes hair cell
differentiation from supporting cells. To test the pioneer activity of LHX3, we will identify its target genes with
CUT&RUN. We will also test if inducible expression of LHX3 alone or with another transcription factor can
promote hair cell differentiation from supporting cells or prosensory cells. In Aim 2, we will define the mode of
action of NR2F1 during cochlear specification. We will test if NR2F1 occupies overlapping cis-regulatory
regions of target genes with GATA3. Additionally, we will test if the DNA-binding domain of NR2F1 is essential
for cochlear specification and if NR2F1 regulates the timing of cochlear hair cell differentiation. Moreover, we
will test if NR2F1 regulates thyroid hormone signaling. By accomplishing these aims, we will not only advance
our understanding of the biology of human inner ear development, but also develop a strategy to realize hair
cell regeneration in the human inner ear. Additionally, information gained from this study will be integrated into
a synthetic biology and bottom-up engineering approach to recapitulate developmental trajectories and achieve
better engineering control with human inner ear organoids."
10997778,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Alcohol-related blackout has traditionally been considered a warning sign of the development of an
Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). However, not all individuals who binge drink experience blackouts, and blackouts
are not uncommon among individuals considered social drinkers. While pharmacological and behavioral
factors contribute to blackout risk, they are not fully predictive. Recent work in the field has begun to consider
individual variability in blackout susceptibility, and the literature indicates that some individuals have a genetic
predisposition to experiencing blackouts. Preliminary work in our lab has indicated that having a history of
certain non-REM parasomnias classified as Disorders of Arousal (DoA) may increase one’s risk of
experiencing blackouts. Disorders of arousal, a diagnostic category that includes sleepwalking, are defined by
inappropriate motor arousal during slow-wave sleep. These arousal events are preceded by decreases in
functional connectivity between the motor cortex and prefrontal and subcortical targets, which allow for wake-
like activity in the motor cortex to occur simultaneously with slow-wave sleep elsewhere. Importantly, atypical
connectivity patterns persist into waking life in these individuals. As preliminary EEG work in our lab has
demonstrated abnormal patterns of resting-state EEG activity in individuals with a history of blackout, we
hypothesize that susceptibility to blackout and susceptibility to disordered arousal during sleep may be
mediated by similar baseline patterns of neural connectivity. Given the role of GABAergic interneurons in
modulating cortical functional connectivity, we hypothesize that individual variability in the efficiency of
GABAergic inhibition of the motor cortex directly contributes to blackout susceptibility. Preliminary work from
our lab has also indicated that self-reported feelings of stimulation in response to alcohol and self-reported
resilience to the motor effects of drinking (e.g., stumbling) are correlated with number of blackouts
experienced. We propose a model in which some individuals express a neurobiological phenotype defined by
reduced efficiency of GABAergic inhibition of the motor cortex, which results in unstable functional connectivity
at sober baseline and a relative resilience of the motor cortex to GABA-A mediated suppression of activity by
alcohol. When paired with steep elevations in blood alcohol concentration, we hypothesize that this phenotype
contributes to functional dissociation of the motor cortex and allows for motor activity past the point at which
long-term memory storage is impaired and behavior is disinhibited (i.e., the blackout state). The purpose of this
project is to investigate the role of GABAergic modulation of the motor cortex in blackout susceptibility using
non-invasive neurophysiological metrics to examine circuitry in individuals with a history of blackout and binge-
drinking controls. Identifying the neurobiological phenotypes associated with vulnerability to blackout could
pave the way for targeted interventions to reduce the significant physical and psychological risks associated
with alcohol-related blackout."
10997756,"Project Summary/ Abstract:
This F31 award will allow Kelsey Sinclair (PI) the research training that will advance her toward her goal of
becoming an independent cancer multimorbidity scientist with an expertise in intervention adaptation and
implementation to optimize cancer care in underserved groups. Cancer-obesity co-morbidity is common and
especially deadly for Black breast cancer survivors (BCS). Although Black women have lower breast cancer
incidence, they have the highest breast cancer mortality rate (40%) of any U.S. race/ethnic group – an effect
attributed in part to comorbid obesity and systemic health disparities. Obesity predicts higher mortality among
Black BCS, and post-cancer diagnosis weight gain predicts increases in mortality. Treatment inequities due to
intersecting weight/race stigma also contribute to cancer screening/treatment delays. One way to fight back
against these disparities is to develop and to deliver obesity treatments adapted to address the unique challenges
of the Black BCS community. Identification of important risk/protective factors can be applied to evidence-based
weight loss interventions to provide inclusive, equitable, and potentially life-extending care. Thus, the proposed
multi-method study will use a socioeconomic framework and multi-methods to discover actual risk/protective
factors for Black BCS with obesity compared to other BCS. PI Sinclair will leverage resources from a parent trial
to first use a quantitative survey to assess 100 BCS from any race-ethnicity to test potential risk and protective
factors that differ for Black BCS (Phase 1). Second, using co-design qualitative methods, initial tailoring of an
evidence-based weight loss intervention for obesity will be done in collaboration with our patient partners – five
Black BCS with obesity (Phase 2). This tailored weight loss protocol will then be delivered in a pilot with 15 Black
BCS with obesity, with preliminary evaluation of potential treatment heterogeneity factors (Phase 3). Via these
phases, the following F31 aims will be addressed: Aim 1: To proactively identify cultural and multimorbid factors
of an obesity intervention for Black BCS and Exploratory Aim 2: To explore obesity treatment response in Black
BCS via subgroup analyses. We hypothesize that Black women with obesity will report the highest risk scores
and lowest protective scores, that qualitative interviews will identify important factors that may not have been
captured quantitatively, and that variables that emerged as relevant with adequate variability across the sample
will impact treatment response. The proposed F31 will thus utilize Phase 1 survey data and Phase 2 qualitative
interviews (Aim 1) as well as Phase 3 post-treatment data (Exploratory Aim 2). Accordingly, it will benefit from
the existing parent pilot infrastructure (e.g., recruitment strategies, participants, trial conduct). For the parent trial,
the outcomes are acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary weight loss of the program. PI Sinclair’s project and
training plan will allow for a comprehensive multi-method analysis of adaptation factors to inform future larger-
scale trials and foundations of a future F32 or K23 for PI Sinclair, a future scholar with expertise in multimorbidity
interventions in cancer, obesity, and other chronic diseases disproportionately impacting underserved groups."

This renewal application will focus on the striatum. It stems from our recent study of the functional
contributions of major corticofugal projections from the auditory cortex (ACx). Anatomically receiving
convergent cortical and thalamic inputs, the striatum is believed to play an important role in central
auditory processing and perception of sound, as evidenced by its involvement in sound-frequency
discrimination related behaviors. However, fundamental questions about how specific auditory
information is processed, integrated in the striatum, and transformed into appropriate actions remain not
well understood. Since the caudal striatum, or the tail of the striatum (TS), receives the highest intensity
of ACx projections among all striatal areas, our initial efforts will be centered on the TS, regarded as the
“auditory striatum”, to explore its functional role in auditory processing and related behaviors. This
proposal builds upon our recent studies on corticostriatal projections from ACx to TS in processing
looming sounds, as well as on the mouse cortico-striatal-thalamic network. More importantly, our pilot
results suggest that a midbrain structure adjacent to the MGB, known as the nucleus of the brachium of
the inferior colliculus (NB in Allen mouse brain atlas, also named “NBIC” or “BIN” in the literature),
provides significant bottom-up auditory signals to TS and influences its auditory processing. By
exploiting mouse genetic models and combining a suite of cutting-edge approaches such as cell-type-
and pathway-specific viral tracing, our recently established AAV1-based anterograde transsynaptic
tagging, in vivo and ex vivo electrophysiology, miniscope calcium imaging, as well as optogenetic
manipulations, we will test our central hypothesis that TS contributes to auditory spatial processing by
integrating binaural information relayed from a unique ascending midbrain-striatal pathway. The
proposed project aims to generate new insights into the functional role of striatum in auditory processing
perception. Results from this project may help to advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of
auditory processing disorders as well as striatum-related neuropsychiatric disorders."

The goal of this proposal is to develop therapeutic antibodies for the treatment of multidrug resistant (MDR) P.
aeruginosa infections, with an emphasis on sepsis. With the rise in antimicrobial resistance around the world we
are running out of therapeutic options against MDR P. aeruginosa. Our laboratory has identified a potential
solution to address this problem: a therapeutic antibody cocktail that targets the lipopolysaccharide of P.
aeruginosa. One of the antibodies present in the cocktail (WVU-VDC-S3D4, or S3D4 for short) completely
protects mice against lethal sepsis, preventing bacterial dissemination and cytokine storm. This antibody is also
more potent than vaccination with a P. aeruginosa whole cell vaccine or passive immunization with serum from
whole cell vaccinated mice. Most interestingly, S3D4 is also capable of directly killing P. aeruginosa in vitro in
the absence of complement or immune cells. In this proposal, we will characterize the mechanism of action of
S3D4, formulate it in an LPS multivalent antibody cocktail, and evaluate efficacy against MDR P. aeruginosa. To
do this, we will evaluate host and bacterial factors involved in S3D4 function (Aims 1 and 2). We will then combine
it as cocktail with three additional antibodies that target the 6 LPS serogroups that cause 87% of P. aeruginosa
bloodstream infection. Efficacy in vitro and in vivo will be evaluated with MDR clinical isolates (Aim 3). We will
also evaluate efficacy against P. aeruginosa biofilms. We hypothesize that a multivalent anti-LPS cocktail of
antibodies, alone or in combination with standard of care antibiotics, will be efficacious for the prevention and
treatment of MDR P. aeruginosa sepsis. By the completion of these studies, we anticipate to elucidate the
mechanism of action of a novel class of antibodies that can directly kill P. aeruginosa in vitro, which will help with
the production of additional antibodies with similar functions against other MDR organisms. We will also produce
proof of concept data to support the generation antibody therapy against P. aeruginosa infections. Altogether,
this project will generate important knowledge to improve the lives of patients affected by this MDR bacterium."

The purpose of this R13 proposal is to support the attendance of trainees, young investigators, and individuals
historically underrepresented in science and medicine, at the 2024 FASEB Conference: Translational
Neuroimmunology: From Bench to Bedside and Back. This will be the 16th biannual FASEB Neuroimmunology
conference, the first having been held in 1988. The current meeting will be held July 28-August 1, 2024 at the
Niagara Falls Conference Center. Neuroimmunology is one of the fastest growing fields in biomedical research
and has been highly successful in terms of the translation of wet bench discoveries into impactful clinical
therapies. The overall objective of this conference is to bring together diverse leading experts and trainees
engaged in neuroimmunology research from a broad range of perspectives, in a collegial and supportive
environment. The specific goals are to: 1) provide a forum for the presentation of unpublished, cutting-edge
research on the intersection of the immune and nervous systems in human health and disease, by speakers
from diverse backgrounds; 2) provide opportunities for both formal and informal discussions amongst world
experts to promote new collaborations and new efforts to translate scientific insights from “bench to bedside”;
3) support the participation of young investigators, particularly those traditionally under-represented in the field,
and facilitate their integration into the broader research community in a meaningful and interactive way; (4)
promote career development skills and principles of justice, equity, diversity and inclusion in the design,
conduct and evaluation of research and the development of the neuroimmunology workforce. The program is
intentionally multifaceted in a single-track, without competing talks, to ensure that attendees working on
different aspects of neuroimmunology research have the opportunity to meet colleagues with complementary
interests and areas of expertise to inspire new ideas and collaborative projects. The agenda also consists of
poster sessions, workshops and “Meet the Expert” sessions and unscheduled afternoon time to encourage
informal communications. These collective features of the conference will facilitate brainstorming and
mentoring in a variety of formats. A priority is to inspire women scientists, and learners and junior faculty from
groups that are traditionally underrepresented in science and medicine, and to connect those individuals with
role models, future mentors, and peers, thereby strengthening their commitment to Neuroimmunology
research. To that end, we are sponsoring workshops on “Fostering Diversity and Equity in study design and
the Neuroimmunology Workforce.” and “Scientific Transparency and Rigor” as well as a career panel
discussion on ““Career pathways from academia to industry.” This conference is designed to foster new,
creative partnerships and mentorships among wet bench scientists, clinical trialists/ researchers, and clinicians
who are focused on neuroimmunology, ultimately leading to clinical advances and the long-term success of the
field."
11000541,"The goal of the Society for Heart and Vascular Metabolism (SHVM) conference is to bring together scientists
and trainees from around the globe to present and discuss cutting-edge research in the field of cardiac and
vascular metabolism. This year’s meeting in St. Louis, Missouri, September 2024, will focus on the latest
research regarding the role of interorgan crosstalk in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Most
prevalent cardiovascular pathologies, such as heart failure and ischemia, have underlying metabolic
derangements directly involved in disease progression, but recent studies have highlighted the relevance of
interorgan crosstalk as a new frontier for cardiovascular research with the ultimate goal of ameliorating CVD. To
that end, SHVM’s 2024 meeting is designed to foster ‘crosstalk’ between the investigative fields of heart and
vascular metabolism and other key organ systems.
 Despite new investigations of interorgan communications, such as exosome trafficking as well as novel
hormonal axes that affect the heart and vasculature, cross-disciplinary research has unique funding and
operational barriers. This is not surprising given the significant challenges of creating multidisciplinary
infrastructure and developing novel techniques evaluating heart and vascular metabolism in the context of
manifold interorgan signals. Some scientists/trainees (PhD students, MD and postdoctoral fellows) may not feel
equipped to tackle the unique barriers to performing cross-disciplinary research. To address these issues, this
conference aims to provide a comprehensive and wide-ranging forum in which investigators from multiple
disciplines will interact and discuss recent research studies that have resulted in meaningful outcomes relevant
to cardiovascular metabolism.
 SHVM meetings have always featured strong participation of diverse trainees from many different regions
in the United States and from around the globe. Moreover, SHVM has an established track record for fostering
productive collaborations and career advancement. This year’s meeting will offer trainee workshops directed by
top experts in metabolic imaging. Titled, “Cutting edge tools for the evaluation of myocardial metabolic
metabolism and function,” the trainee workshop will facilitate interaction between trainees with junior and
established investigators. The 2024 meeting will feature 2 keynote speakers, 19 plenary speakers, 4 speakers
for Continuing Medical Education talks, 4 Early Investigator winner talks, and 9 other short talks selected from
submitted abstracts, in addition to 2 workshops, and 2 poster sessions. The sessions will have strong
representation from early-stage investigators, women, and underrepresented minorities. We are requesting
funds to offset costs associated with trainee, speaker, and keynote speaker participation to continue the tradition
of SHVM meetings, which are considered the premiere conferences in cardiac metabolism."
11002828,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Anhedonia, defined as a reduced interest in or motivation for rewards, is a core symptom of depression
that has been linked to reduced treatment response and increased risk of suicide. A key risk factor for the
development of anhedonia is chronic stress, which has further been shown to impact function within the
mesolimbic dopamine (DA). DA is a key neurotransmitter for motivation; both clinical and preclinical studies
have shown that dopamine depletion reduces willingness to expend effort. To date, however, human studies
linking dysregulation of dopamine to stress-induced anhedonia are lacking. This is due in part to the challenges
associated with taking in vivo measurements of dopamine in humans. Dopamine activity is commonly
measured in human studies using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. PET is a popular
neuroimaging technique used to provide measurements of dopamine activity. However, it is costly, invasive,
and necessitates exposure to radiation. These factors make it difficult to conduct large scale studies.
Neuromelanin magnetic resonance imaging (NM-MRI) is a relatively new non-invasive imaging technique used
to take proxy measurements of dopamine. NM-MRI works by imaging neuromelanin, a pigment that
accumulates in high concentrations in dopamine neurons, over the lifespan. Prior studies have shown that NM-
MRI signal is correlated with PET signal. In short, NM-MRI can provide proxy measurements of dopamine
without the same limitations posed by PET. In the current study, we will examine associations between NM-
MRI signal and behavioral and neural measures of motivational anhedonia. We will also explore the
relationship between NM-MRI signal and fMRI measures of corticostriatal circuit function. Lastly, we will
examine the relationship between NM-MRI signal and physiological and self-report measures of stress. By
completing this study, the PI will gain the opportunity to grow as an independent researcher and become a
more competitive post-doctoral candidate."
11003525,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with projected numbers continually
rising, mandating a need for novel therapeutic approaches. A common feature in the development of HF is
hypertrophic growth of cardiac myocytes and associated remodeling of the size, dimensions, and function of the
heart. Pathologic hypertrophy initially occurs as an adaptive response, leading to increased width of individual
myocytes and causing concentric growth characterized by thickened heart walls, reduced wall strain, and
maintained function. Left unchecked, this hypertrophic growth becomes maladaptive and reorients to growth
along myocyte length, causing relative wall thinning, heart dilation, and declining function leading to HF. We
currently have a poor understanding of the mechanisms which govern this transition, yet, limited observations
where adaptive growth is preserved shows resistance to HF development. Therefore, this proposal seeks to
identify the fundamental mechanisms underlying adaptive and maladaptive hypertrophic growth and investigate
targeted interventions to maintain and/or restore the adaptive state for HF prevention. This proposal will address
the critical distinction that not all pathologic hypertrophy is adverse and that preserving the adaptive, concentric
state is therapeutically advantageous in response to chronic stress. Preliminary data has implicated a role for
the phospho-regulation of the transcription factor STAT3 in mediating this transition. In particular,
phosphorylation of the serine residue 727 on STAT3 was revealed as a critical target with dramatic influence
over concentric/eccentric growth. Therefore, our central hypothesis is that STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation is
directly responsible for the induction of gene programs which drive adaptive versus maladaptive hypertrophy
and represents a therapeutic target in HF treatment. The approach will be to: 1) Determine the molecular
mechanism linking STAT3 Ser727 phospho-regulation to hypertrophic orientation. 2) Define novel gene targets
and pathways which tune cardiac myocyte growth and hypertrophy. Specifically, this approach will address
altered STAT3 transcriptional activity dependent on Ser727 phosphorylation through ChIP-seq and RNA-seq to
identify gene programs which enact concentric/eccentric states. 3) Lastly, we will test novel therapeutic strategies
to support adaptive cardiac remodeling during pathologic hypertrophy in vivo to assess effectiveness in HF
prevention. Overall, we anticipate that these data will expand our understanding of HF remodeling, delineate the
nature of adaptive, concentric hypertrophy, and reveal novel therapeutic opportunity in HF. Furthermore,
characterization of STAT3 phospho-regulation and transcriptional activity will provide significant
pathophysiologic insight to numerous other disease states such as cancer, fibrosis, inflammation, and immune
signaling where STAT3 activity has been implicated."
11003839,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Polysubstance use, defined as the use of multiple substances within a specified period, increases the risk for
adverse events, including fatal overdose. This is reflected in the ongoing ‘fourth wave’ of the opioid overdose
epidemic, marked by an increase in stimulant-involved overdoses. Drivers of polysubstance use within social
networks remain poorly understood, yet understanding them is needed to prevent potential downstream adverse
effects of substance use (e.g., substance use disorder, overdose). Sexually minoritized men have an elevated
prevalence of substance use, including polysubstance use, and substance use disorders, and are also
overburdened by new HIV infections. Further, sexually minoritized men are at greater risk of experiencing
loneliness. I hypothesize that loneliness is a potential driver of substance use outcomes and HIV transmission.
A distinct construct from depression and social isolation, loneliness is defined as a subjective discrepancy
between actual and desired social connections. Loneliness is a well-described risk factor for poor health, including
mortality; qualitative research suggests an association between loneliness and non-fatal overdose, but this has
not yet been robustly studied. The overarching goals of this R36 proposal, Dissecting the role of loneliness on
substance use- and HIV-related outcomes among sexual minority men in the United States and Canada, are to
delineate the impact of loneliness on substance use (i.e., drug, alcohol, and polysubstance use) and non-fatal
overdose; and to assess the relationship between loneliness and HIV-related outcomes (i.e., HIV prevention,
HIV risk). Aim 1 of this proposal will examine the relationship between loneliness, substance use (drug, alcohol,
and polysubstance use), and HIV prevention (antiretroviral adherence among people with HIV and PrEP use
among people without HIV) within a cohort of sexually minoritized men and gender-expansive groups in Chicago,
Illinois. I will conduct exploratory social network analyses to examine further substance use within social
networks and how loneliness moderates this relationship. Leveraging a unique data linkage between survey and
administrative health data, Aim 2 of this proposal will examine the relationship between loneliness, non-fatal
overdose, and HIV risk in Vancouver, Canada. This project will advance NIDA’s research priority to support
dissertation research examining social factors that influence drug use outcomes and the intersection of HIV and
drug use. This proposal additionally addresses NIDA’s noted interest in loneliness as a potential leverage point
for substance use prevention. Findings from this R36 study will help identify individuals at risk for substance use,
inform policies seeking to prevent HIV transmission and inform a future F32 and K01 award application. The
proposed project and mentorship team will allow the Principal Investigator to develop expertise at the intersection
of HIV research, substance use epidemiology, and social network analyses in pursuit of her long-term goal of
becoming an independent researcher at an academic institution."

 Recent policy debates to extend Medicaid postpartum are fueled by the US maternal health crisis: The
US maternal mortality rate is the highest among high-income countries and includes stark racial inequities. Black
people have more than 3X risk of dying from pregnancy related causes than White people. Racial and ethnic
disparities for maternal morbidity are equally glaring. Immigrants, too, face higher rates of maternal morbidity
and perinatal complications. Sustained, continuous access to perinatal health care is critical to maternal health
and health equity, yet ~45% of birthing people with Medicaid and CHIP lose coverage after 60 days. Postpartum
Medicaid extensions are key features of recent policy attempts to address the deplorably high Black maternal
mortality and morbidity rates. However, structural racism shaping US institutions means such policies could
either mitigate or exacerbate inequities. Policymakers need evidence about the impact of postpartum Medicaid
access on maternal health equity to guide design and implementation.
 Since March 2020, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) has conferred a de-facto
Medicaid postpartum coverage extension nationwide, but it is due to expire imminently. Meanwhile, 27 states
have already adopted or are seeking to pass legislation to extend postpartum Medicaid coverage, but their
policy approaches vary in legal basis, eligibility criteria, length of coverage, and immigrant exclusions.
Moreover, states vary in their existing Medicaid eligibility policies prior to the pandemic, which has profoundly
shaped who has remained eligible during the pandemic with uncertain eligibility post-pandemic. Our
overarching objective is to evaluate the impact of postpartum Medicaid policy on maternal health
equity. We propose using an adaptive concurrent mixed-methods design to measure national changes in
postpartum Medicaid enrollment while exploiting differences in two states' policies to examine health care
utilization in greater depth. We focus on two large, diverse states: Texas (TX) has expanded Medicaid to six
months postpartum through a demonstration waiver, while New York (NY) is using the American Rescue Plan
Act to expand Medicaid 12 months postpartum. Using national American Community Survey (ACS) and
Medicaid claims data from TX and NY, our quantitative aims will apply interrupted time series (ITS) and
difference-in-difference (DID) approaches. In our qualitative aim, we will interview postpartum women,
healthcare providers, community-based organizations, and policymakers on the efficacy of postpartum
Medicaid extension implementation, which will inform the analysis approach and enrich our findings.
 Our proposal not only fills gaps in targeted research on the impact of postpartum Medicaid access on
maternal health equity, but also shifts the paradigm to focus on the role of structural racism in the design and
implementation of policy and its influence on pregnant people's access to postpartum benefits. Our findings will
be a key resource for policymakers on equitable design and implementation of postpartum Medicaid extension."

Since the introduction of chemotherapy for the treatment of childhood leukemia more than 60 years ago, the
prognosis of childhood cancer has improved dramatically. The overall 5-year survival rate for childhood
cancers, many of which were uniformly fatal in the pre-chemotherapy era, is now 84%. Progress for a number
of childhood cancers, however, has been limited, with approximately 50% of children with acute myelogenous
leukemia, 50% of children with high-risk neuroblastoma, and more than 90% of children with brainstem glioma,
still succumbing to their disease. In the US, cancer remains the leading cause of death from disease in children
greater than one year of age. Moreover, the late effects of cancer treatment, including permanent organ and
tissue damage, hormonal and reproductive dysfunction and second cancers, are of special concern, with more
than 40% of the 500,000 survivors of childhood cancer (estimated as of 2020) experiencing a significant health
related quality of life complication from childhood cancer and its treatment. Thus, despite our advances,
development of new therapeutic approaches must be a priority for childhood cancer basic, translational and
clinical researchers. The Children’s Oncology Group (COG), the world’s largest organization devoted
exclusively to childhood and adolescent cancer research, was founded 20 years ago. The COG’s
multidisciplinary research team, comprised of more than 9,000 members, conducts research at more than 220
leading children’s hospitals, universities, and cancer centers. This proposal is for COG, as part of the National
Cancer Institute’s (NCI) National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN), to continue its collaborative research work
that supports the mission of improving the outcome for all children with cancer. The COG will design and
conduct clinical-translational studies for children with cancer that builds on an increasing understanding of the
molecular basis for pediatric malignancies and has the highest potential to improve the outcome. Using
innovative clinical trial designs suitable for the study of rare diseases, we will study novel therapeutic
approaches including but not limited to targeted small molecule drugs, immunotherapies and cellular therapies.
The COG research portfolio importantly also includes clinical trials focused on improving the quality of life for
children with cancer and childhood cancer survivors. As more than 90% of children diagnosed with cancer in
the US are treated at COG member institutions, COG has the ability to offer a diverse population of children
with cancer and their families the opportunity to participate in innovative research. This research effort includes
allowing for collection and annotation of biospecimens from all children with cancer, providing the foundation
for discovery and accelerating the most promising research efforts conducted in laboratories around the world.
The proposal is for support of the COG Network Operations Center, clinician-scientists who develop and
conduct research, and for member sites to participate through enrollment of eligible subjects."

Children with Down syndrome (DS) have a 3-5 times greater prevalence of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
Disorder (ADHD) than typically developing children. Despite their higher risk of ADHD and consensus guideline
recommendations to treat children with intellectual disability (ID) and comorbid ADHD with stimulants (the most
efficacious ADHD treatment), children with DS+ADHD have disproportionately low rates of stimulant
medication treatment. Possible reasons for under-utilization of stimulant treatment in DS+ADHD include: 1)
diagnostic uncertainty regarding how to accurately diagnose ADHD in children with DS, making providers
prone to “diagnostic overshadowing” (i.e., attributing ADHD to their ID); 2) the absence of any prior clinical
trials examining the safety and efficacy of stimulant medication in children with DS+ADHD; and 3) concerns
about cardiac safety, given the high incidence of congenital heart disease or defects (CHD) in the DS
population. Based on R61 pilot trial findings, we propose the first randomized clinical trial of stimulant
medication in children with DS+ADHD to provide evidence regarding the short and long-term safety and
efficacy of stimulant use in children with DS+ADHD, both with and without CHD. One hundred (100) children
with DS+ADHD aged 6-17 years will participate. Children with DS+ADHD will complete a multi-phased
randomized, double-blind clinical trial with crossover to placebo and long-term follow-up to assess the short-
and long-term efficacy and safety of stimulant medications for treating ADHD symptoms and impairment in
children with DS. Study aims of the R33 will focus on 1) Assessing the short- and long-term safety of stimulant
treatment in children with DS+ADHD with a specific focus on cardiac safety; 2) Determining the short- and
long-term efficacy of stimulant treatment at remediating cognitive, behavioral, and functional impairments in
children with DS+ADHD; and 3) Exploring moderators (e.g., IQ, ADHD subtype/presentation, executive
functioning levels, comorbid internalizing disorders, CHD) of stimulant response and adverse effects. Results
from this study will provide much needed diagnostic and treatment data that will directly impact the outcomes
of the approximately 45,000 children with DS+ADHD nationwide."
11004854,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Cellular function is regulated at the chromatin level by epigenomic features, including histone post-
translational modifications (PTMs) and chromatin-associated proteins (CAPs). The development of tools for
genomic mapping has ushered in a new era of epigenetic research, placing histone PTMs and CAPs in the
spotlight as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Despite this progress, leveraging epigenomics for clinical
studies has been hindered by a lack of high-performance genomic mapping assays that are compatible with
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, due to DNA damage that is incurred during the FFPE process.
FFPE is the gold-standard method for preservation and storage of clinical samples, with millions of samples from
diverse tissues and pathologies banked annually. While other FFPE sample-compatible chromatin mapping
assays have been developed, these approaches are unsuitable for clinical research due to limited sensitivity,
throughput, and / or resolution of specific chromatin features. As such, FFPE samples represent a largely
untapped goldmine for clinical genomic analyses. Development of a next-generation chromatin profiling assay
for FFPE samples would unlock access to disease-related epigenetic information within these clinical samples,
enabling novel biomarker discovery / validation and insights into therapeutical targeting of epigenomic targets.
 To meet this need, EpiCypher is partnering with Dr. Kami Ahmad (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
Center) to develop CUTANA-FFPETM, a first-in-class low input genomic mapping tool for the analysis of FFPE
clinical samples. In Phase I, we developed the CUTANA-FFPE approach and successfully applied it to identify
tumor-specific regulatory elements in FFPE samples, demonstrating greatly improved performance compared to
existing assays and the transformative potential of this technology to advance clinical research. In Phase II, we
will prepare for commercial launch by developing standard operating procedures (SOPs) for processing FFPE
samples and validating the assay for diverse targets. Next, we will demonstrate the clinical utility of this novel
technology by expanding the approach to various tissue types, optimizing in situ target visualization, and defining
quality control parameters for banked FFPE samples. Finally, we will integrate data analysis pipelines into a
user-friendly and HIPAA-compliant bioinformatics portal, assemble CUTANA-FFPE beta kits, and apply
CUTANA-FFPE to map diverse targets in FFPE samples from diseased clinical tissue. Market availability of this
assay would be transformative for clinical research by enabling chromatin profiling in FFPE tissue, supporting
next-generation biomarker discovery and drug development."
11004855,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 R-loops are triple-stranded nucleic acid structures consisting of a DNA:RNA hybrid and a displaced single
DNA strand. R-loops are generally transient in nature, but persistence of stable R-loops leads to DNA damage
and genome instability, and dysregulation of these structures is strongly associated with aging and
neurodegenerative diseases. As such, the study of R-loops is essential to understand mechanisms driving these
diseases, and for the development of novel biomarkers and therapeutics. However, there remains much debate
in the field regarding the specifics of how and where R-loops are formed, and how they are implicated in gene
regulation in both normal and disease states. This is largely due to a lack of reliable approaches for mapping the
genomic distribution of R-loops in vivo. While multiple approaches exist, many utilize an affinity purification
strategy with an unreliable antibody (S9.6), requiring high inputs and generating noisy data with off-target
artifacts. As such, to accelerate clinical research on neurodegenerative diseases, there is a strong market need
for a next-generation R-loop mapping assay that is highly sensitive, scalable, and reliable.
 Here, EpiCypher is partnering with Dr. Jessica Tyler (Weill Cornell) to develop CUTANA-RH™, a novel
approach for genome-wide profiling of R-loops to accelerate aging and neurodegenerative disease research.
The first major innovation of this proposal is the development of a modular immunotethering strategy for genomic
mapping of R-loops, which is compatible with both CUT&RUN- and CUT&Tag-based workflows. Rather than the
unreliable S9.6 antibody, our approach leverages a catalytically inactive RNase H1 enzyme (RH∆) as a highly
specific detection reagent for the DNA:RNA hybrid component of R-loops. In the CUTANA-RH workflows, cells
or nuclei are incubated with GST-tagged RH∆ followed by an anti-GST antibody. Next, pAG-MNase (or pAG-
Tn5) is added for targeted cleavage and sequencing of cleaved fragments, yielding precise localization of
R-loops genome-wide. The second major innovation of our approach is the development of a designer
nucleosome (dNuc) spike-in control panel including dNucs with RNA:DNA hybrid linkers (RH-dNucs). These will
be utilized to 1) perform technical monitoring for assay optimization and sample quality control, and 2) normalize
data for quantitative comparisons. The gains in throughput, sensitivity, and quantification provided by CUTANA-
RH compared to affinity-based approaches will be highly enabling for basic and clinical research. In Phase I
equivalent studies, we developed a first-generation CUTANA-RH assay and demonstrated its ability to reliably
map R-loops in cultured cells. In Phase II, we will generate RH-dNucs and optimize the CUTANA-RH workflows
(Aim 1). We will then validate our assays in a stimulation model and optimize protocols for primary cells and
diverse tissues (Aim 2). We will prepare for commercialization by scaling manufacturing, validating CUTANA-RH
beta-kits, and developing automated workflows to support services (Aim 3). Finally, we will demonstrate the
power of this assay for clinical applications by profiling R-loops in Alzheimer’s disease brain tissue (Aim 3)."

In response to PAR-22-202 “Grand Opportunity in Medications Development for Substance-Use Disorders
(U01 Clinical Trial Optional),” this revised application (U01DA060704) requests 3 years of support to continue
developing the novel opioid receptor antagonist methocinnamox (MCAM) for preventing opioid relapse after
detoxification. MCAM will fill an unmet need for an orally bioavailable, shelf-stable, long-acting medication for
preventing relapse. MCAM prevents and reverses the effects of µ-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists, including
ultra-potent agonists such as fentanyl, in several species and by multiple routes of administration with a single
dose being effective for >2 weeks. In vitro and in vivo studies have not identified any clinical adverse signs for
MCAM over a >3,000-fold dose range. IND-enabling safety pharmacology and toxicology studies in rats and
dogs (Charles River Laboratories) are complete and found no adverse clinical signs. Synthesis of MCAM
(Veranova) was improved, increasing the yield, maleate was determined to be a preferred salt, two 1-kilogram
batches of non-GMP MCAM were manufactured for non-clinical studies, ongoing stability studies are showing
MCAM to be shelf stable for at least 9 months, and analytical methods for manufacturing GMP MCAM are being
developed. In a pre-IND meeting in November 2023 (facilitated by Allucent), the FDA agreed with our proposed
non-clinical and clinical programs. A use patent for MCAM was issued in 2019 and 3 other patents are pending.
This application includes scientists with expertise in drug discovery and development, basic scientists who have
studied MCAM extensively, clinicians with expertise testing medications for substance use disorders, as well as
commercial CRO partners that will manufacture GMP MCAM (Veranova), synthesize deuterated MCAM
(Moravek), conduct non-clinical toxicology and safety pharmacology studies (Charles River Laboratories), and
serve as the regulatory agent to the FDA as well as manage clinical trials (Allucent; including a former senior
pharmacology/toxicology reviewer who served in the Division of Anesthesia, Addiction Medicine and Pain
Medicine, the Division that participated in the pre-IND meeting and will review the IND application). This revised
application requests 3 years of support to continue developing MCAM with the following 4 specific aims. 1)
Submit an IND for preventing relapse. 2) Complete Phase 1 and Phase 1b clinical trials with MCAM. 3) Plan a
Phase 2 clinical trial with MCAM. 4) Conduct additional non-clinical toxicology and other studies as
recommended by the FDA. Completing these aims, along with securing additional intellectual property protection
through pending US patents, will further strengthen the feasibility of developing MCAM as a medication for
preventing relapse after detoxification. Completing these aims will also significantly increase the value of this
project to potential future partners and investors who have the expertise and financial resources to commercialize
MCAM into a marketable product for preventing relapse as well as other possible indications (e.g., prevention
and reversal of opioid overdose, prophylaxis for opioid poisoning/weaponization)."
11001827,"Project Summary/Abstract
Stigma is a significant barrier to HIV prevention and treatment
. Stigma
is associated with psychosocial
challenges, including lack of social support and depression. Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has the highest rate of
HIV infection among childbearing women. Young women (< 24 years) are twice as likely to be HIV-positive
than men of the same age. In SSA, women living with HIV (WLWH) also experience pervasive stigma related
to both HIV infection and being pregnant in the context of HIV infection, with HIV-related stigma associated
with poor adherence to antiretroviral medication, postpartum depression, loss to follow-up, and low utilization of
healthcare services to prevent mother-to-child transmission. Despite the impact of unique stigma experiences
during pregnancy and postpartum, targeted interventions to reduce HIV stigma are lacking in SSA. In fact,
WLWH in Ghana have among the highest levels of HIV-related stigma and depression with no intervention
available to address these health outcomes. We propose to adapt and test an intervention module from Project
Accept’s (HPTN 043, U01MH066701) Post Test Support Services (PTSS) that reduced HIV-related stigma and
improved outcomes for adults in the USA and reduced community-level stigma when adapted to adults living in
Tanzania, Zimbabwe, South Africa and Thailand. Given HIV treatment lapses in postpartum WLWH in Ghana
and throughout SSA, targeted stigma interventions for this population represent a critical unmet need, with
implications for WLWH and stigma interventions globally. To address this need, we propose to adapt the PTSS
module for pregnant and postpartum WLWH with the ultimate goal of reducing stigma and depression and
increasing engagement in HIV treatment in this high-risk population, leading to better maternal-child outcomes.
In Aim 1, longitudinal data from 30 WLWH will be used to describe their stigma experience during pregnancy
and postpartum and effects on mental health (depression, anxiety) to inform the Project Accept intervention
adaptation process and compare with in-depth interview data from care providers (n=20) on their perspectives
of stigma, providing care in the context of stigma, and intervention needs. In Aim 2, we will form a community
advisory board to adapt the PTSS module using the ADAPT-ITT model with particular focus on cultural and
gender. We will solicit both healthcare providers’ and patient-level feedback about the pilot intervention prior to
implementing Aim 3. In Aim 3, we will evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy (on stigma,
mental health and ART adherence) of the adapted intervention during a pilot test with 90 WLWH randomized
and stratified by developmental age group to either intervention or usual care controls, guided by the NIH
Stage Model for behavioral intervention development. These findings will provide foundational data on
feasibility and acceptability to refine the design, sampling, and measures for a large multi-country randomized
controlled trial to rigorously test the impact of a peer-based, culturally and gender-tailored intervention adapted
for pregnant and postpartum WLWH to reduce HIV-related stigma and barriers to HIV treatment."
11001731,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Normal coronary artery formation is essential for heart growth and function. Malformed coronary arteries are a
clinically significant birth defect that can cause life-threatening cardiac complications, including ventricular
noncompaction, myocardial ischemia, and sudden cardiac death. Yet, developmental mechanisms that drive
proper coronary artery formation are incompletely understood, which has hindered our ability to develop the
heart-specific interventions for this devastating disease. The long-term goal of this project is therefore to reveal
the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying coronary artery development so that we may identify key
regulatory factors for developing new targeted therapies to combat this congenital condition. We have addressed
this goal during previous finding period. Our studies have shown that embryonic coronary arteries in the inner
compact myocardium are formed by ventricular endocardial cells through angiogenesis regulated by the VEGF-
NOTCH signaling. Furthermore, our studies have revealed that these embryonic coronary arteries undergo
angiogenic expansion perinatally to add the neovessels to the growing compact myocardium. However, in
contrast to the vascularization of the compact myocardium, we know little about vascularization of trabecular
myocardium which remains largely avascular until birth. We have recently identified a subpopulation of coronary
progenitor cells among ventricular endocardial cells which are committed to the coronary arteries in the
trabecular myocardium. We named these cells as the second wave coronary progenitors (SCPs) to separate
them from the first wave coronary progenitors (FCPs) for the coronary vessels at the compact myocardium.
SCPs acquire angiogenic potential earlier in embryonic development through a previously unknown endocardial
to mesenchymal transformation (EMT) long before they undergo angiogenesis later during perinatal periods to
vascularize the trabecular myocardium. In this renewal application, we propose to characterize this new
angiogenic-EMT paradigm (angioEMT) by SCPs. Our overarching hypothesis is that vascularization of trabecular
myocardium by SCPs is regulated by a “two-hit” mechanism involving sequential angioEMT and hypoxia
signaling. We plan to test this hypothesis in three Specific Aims. Aim 1 will characterize SCPs by distinguishing
them from FCPs using a lineage-based single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis and a modified
functional angioEMT assay. Aim 2 will define the angioEMT signaling in the early fate decision by SCPs using
genetic loss-of-function approaches investigating the TGFb signaling. Aim 3 will decipher the angiogenic
signaling in the later angiogenic activation of SCPs focusing on VEGFA-VEGFR3 and DLL4-NOTCH1 signaling.
Vascularization of trabecular myocardium as well as trabecular compaction in the individual nulls will be
examined by histology, immunostaining, and RNAscope in situ hybridization. The changes in the SCP lineages
will be determined by scRNA-seq analysis, whereas the key factors underlying the two-hit angioEMT process
will be identified through gene network analysis. By completing these aims, we expect to provide new
mechanistic insights into coronary artery development that inform developmental pathogenesis of coronary
artery anomalies and ventricular noncompaction."

 Down syndrome (DS), the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, accounts for ~30% of all
moderate-to-severe IDD cases, with ~5,500 new individuals diagnosed with DS each year in the United States.
DS is associated with varying degrees of cognitive impairment from infancy onward, yet progress has been very
limited in understanding the relationships between neurodevelopment in DS and deficits in function. While clear
structural brain differences and altered functional connectivity have been observed in DS at older ages, limited
knowledge of infant brain development in DS hampers understanding of the relationship between brain
differences and early delays, as well as the impact of disrupted development of neurocircuitry on later function.
Infant brain imaging studies are needed to clarify mechanisms that could guide novel interventions during a
highly plastic stage of neurodevelopment and to identify biomarkers that could inform the personalization of DS
treatment and enhanced outcomes. In-depth characterization of DS-associated developmental differences in
neural circuit structure and function is also key to evaluating a range of emerging pharmacologic therapies and
genetic modulators that show promise for improving long-term function.
 To address these gaps, our team proposes to complete deep phenotyping and neuroimaging in a DS
infant cohort in response to RFA-OD-24-003, which articulates the plan for multiple sites to collaboratively
assemble a lifespan cohort of individuals with DS. Here we propose to leverage the Infant Brain Imaging Study
Network (IBIS), a multisite, multidisciplinary team with >15 years’ experience in infant recruitment and collection
of longitudinal behavioral and neuroimaging data in typically developing infants and infants with Autism spectrum
disorder (ASD), DS, and Fragile X Syndrome. Our specific aims are: 1) To collect multimodal neuroimaging,
including structural and functional MRI, as well as EEG, in a cohort of 100 infants with DS and 50 typically
developing controls at ages 6, 12, and 24 months; 2) to perform concurrent, longitudinal deep phenotyping on
these infants in key developmental domains of cognition and adaptive function, and 3) to collect data
characterizing variation in early social communication in these infants that would advance early risk assessment
for ASD, which occurs in ~15% of children with DS. Our team will leverage IBIS’ expertise in ASD-relevant
phenotyping to include standardized clinical measures as well as dimensional research measures allowing more
refined characterization of social attention and language. Data will be collected on medical comorbidities,
sociodemographic information, and family environmental factors, along with biospecimens for future genetic
analyses. Data will be accessible to the scientific community and allow novel analyses to characterize the nature
and timing of altered neurodevelopment in DS, as well as establish a richly phenotyped cohort for future
longitudinal studies elucidating relationships between infant brain and behavioral development and long-term
outcomes."
10979966,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In the treatment of BRAFV600MUT melanoma, acquired resistance to MAPK inhibitor (MAPKi) limits its survival
benefits. Currently, MAPKi therapy is unavailable to patients with non-BRAFV600MUT melanoma. To improve
MAPKi therapy and to extend its application to more patients, we propose a project to develop two general
concepts to render MAPKi therapy more effective. Both concepts aim to prevent acquired MAPKi resistance by
targeting processes that are operative early on MAPKi therapy and that enable melanoma persisters to undergo
clonal evolution. In prior publications, we and others have shown that the selective pressure of MAPKi elicits (i)
a new round of genomic instability, leading to clonal diversification and selective expansion of clones that drive
acquired resistance and (ii) a new round of immune editing and hence immune resistance, leading to selective
expansion of clones that evade antitumor immunity (in particular cytotoxic T cells). We hypothesize that
therapeutic strategies that address these adaptive mechanisms in residual tumor cells on MAPKi therapy can
potentially prevent the seeds of acquired resistance. We expect that preventive approaches such as these,
combined with the more durable efficacy of antitumor immunity, should be more effective than conventional
approaches to target specific vulnerabilities of acquired resistance, due to extensive tumor heterogeneity and
clonal evolution resulting from disease progression.
In Aim 1, we build on our recent study showing that genomic instability such as chromothripsis gives rise to
amplicons that are selected by MAPKi to cause acquired resistance. These amplicons may be intrachromosomal
or extrachromosomal, the latter as circular ecDNAs. This finding led to further discovery that a combination to
block these mechanisms of genomic instability may prevent acquired resistance and the design of a trial testing
this combination as targeted therapy for NRASMUT melanoma. We hypothesize that the mechanisms by which
MAPKi elicits de novo genomic instability represent combinatorial targets to prevent acquired resistance. These
mechanisms involve the partial rupture of primary and micronuclear membranes, chromosome mis-segregation
and DNA-damaging proteins that aberrantly access normally protected chromosomal DNAs. In Aim 2, we build
on our recent published and unpublished studies showing that innate/adaptive immune resistance arises in
persisters early on MAPKi or immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, which results in PD-L1 accumulation
on the tumor surface. To diminish immune resistance, we identified a tool compound AK087 to degrade surface
PD-L1, thereby improving the efficacy of MAPKi (and ICB) therapy in immune-competent murine tumor models.
Here, we will dissect the mechanisms of action of AK087 to guide further the rational development of PD-L1
degraders as a general combinatorial strategy to improve the efficacy current melanoma therapies."
10980028,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Novel PET Imaging to Guide Therapy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Liver cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide, with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
constituting more than 75% of all liver cancers. Locoregional therapies (LRTs), such as transcatheter arterial
radioembolization (TARE) with Yttrium-90 (Y90), play a critical role in the care of patients with HCC. For patients
undergoing LRT, time is of the essence; the time required to determine how an HCC responds to LRT is a critical
determinant in the overall care algorithm and outcome for these patients. Current methods to predict response
to Y90 LRT rely on standard-of-care (SOC) anatomical imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or
computed tomography (CT), which remain ambiguous for months following treatment. During this critical waiting,
physicians and patients face uncertainty with respect to disease status, with eligibility for future interventions
frequently compromised by ambiguities associated with determining treatment outcomes.
 In this project, we propose to evaluate an innovative molecular imaging approach to predict response to
Y90 LRT much earlier than SOC imaging. We have previously evaluated 18F-FSPG PET in liver cancer and
found it to be highly suitable for lesion detection and evaluation of response to therapy. Cancer cell accumulation
of 18F-FSPG is mediated by xCT (SLC7A11) transporter activity, which is highly correlated with resistance to
radiation. Thus, we hypothesize that 18F-FSPG PET represents an ideal biomarker to predict the response of
HCC to Y90 LRT at baseline or soon after therapy, to identify residual, Y90-resistant disease and early
recurrence. Complementary to imaging, liquid biopsy involves the collection of blood or other body fluids for the
detection of tumor-derived molecular specimens, including circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating tumor
DNA (ctDNA). In this application, we propose to determine if ctDNA levels are actionable in the setting of patients
with HCC undergoing Y90 LRT, triggering future 18F-FSPG PET/CT examinations in these patients.
 Our overall objective is to evaluate 18F-FSPG PET as a means to predict early response and recurrence
following Y90 therapy and to determine whether PET imaging and ctDNA are correlated. Our overarching
hypothesis is that 18F-FSPG PET will predict response to Y90 therapy and tumor recurrence sooner than
standard-of-care (SOC) imaging and will be highly correlated with ctDNA liquid biopsy. We will test our
hypothesis, in two Specific Aims. Aim 1. To evaluate the relationship between 18F-FSPG uptake in HCC lesions,
ctDNA in blood, and clinical response to Y90 radioembolization therapy by SOC imaging. Aim 2. To evaluate
voxel-wise correlations between post-treatment 18F-FSPG intra-tumoral accumulation and SOC imaging in
patients with HCC who have undergone TARE.
Clinical Impact: This study holds the potential to improve HCC disease management by providing novel imaging
and liquid biopsy approaches that predict response to Y90 LRT much earlier than conventional means."
10980052,"Cryptosporidium is an important intestinal pathogen for which neither prophylaxis nor effective treatments are available.
The parasite was first recognized as an AIDS-defining opportunistic infection, and immune suppression remains an
important risk. However, immunocompetent individuals are also susceptible, and Cryptosporidium is responsible for
frequent U.S. waterborne outbreaks. More recently, Cryptosporidium was identified as a leading global cause of disease
and death in infants. Humans are susceptible to multiple Cryptosporidium species and strains, and the epidemiology of
cryptosporidiosis is a complex web of human to human and zoonotic transmission. Population surveys suggest that
genetic exchange between these lineages drives recent adaptation to new hosts and environments. Parasite sex offers an
opportunity for recombination and virulence evolution, but this problem has been largely intractable. We developed new
technology to harness the parasite lifecycle for forward genetics. We conduct genetic crosses between phenotypically
distinct parasites and map quantitative trait loci associated with persistence and host specificity through bulk segregant
analysis of selected progeny. Using reverse genetics and phenotypic assays we will validate association and explore
specific gene function. We will define the molecular mechanisms that govern the ability to infect and persist in different
hosts, understand how these mechanisms interact with host specificity, and establish to what extent they are modulated
or breached by sexual recombination. Answers to these questions are not only critical to our understanding of
Cryptosporidium epidemiology, but also of great concern to drug and vaccine development to gauge the potential of
emerging resistance and evasion."

Treatment with the chemotherapy drug, Cisplatin, frequently results in developing and/or progressing chronic
kidney disease (CKD). Cisplatin accumulates in renal proximal tubular cells, which reabsorb nutrients and
metabolize Cisplatin to reactive thiols that cause oxidative damage. Injured tubular cells that fail to repair are
known drivers of progressively declining kidney function and show impaired mitochondrial oxidative metabolism.
We have supportive evidence demonstrating that GC4419, a mitochondrially targeted superoxide (O2•–)
dismutase (SOD) mimetic, protects the kidney against oxidative stress and cisplatin-induced CKD in mice and
humans. GC4419 also reverses electron transport chain (ETC) disruptions and improves mitochondrial oxidative
metabolism. Building on recent breakthroughs from our group, we will test the hypothesis that increasing
mitochondrial O2•– dismutation in renal tubular cells will reduce cisplatin-induced renal injury and promote renal
repair by reversing mitochondrial ETC disruptions and increasing NADPH regeneration by the pentose
phosphate pathway. In Aim 1, we will determine how tubular mitochondrial O2•– mediated interactions with ETC
complex II disrupt mitochondrial ETC function in cisplatin-induced CKD. In Aim 2, we will establish how O2•–
dismutation impacts renal NADPH metabolism in cisplatin-induced repair. In Aim 3, we will determine renal
biomarkers that predict the beneficial effects of GC4419 in vivo. The overall objective of this proposal is to
increase our understanding of how tubular O2•– dismutation protects from cisplatin-induced CKD and to develop
translational tools that will facilitate risk stratification strategies for future SOD-mimetic clinical trial design in
patients fighting cancer with Cisplatin. To that end, we will incorporate the following innovative methods using 1)
newly developed mouse model to delete mitochondrial SOD in tubular cells for pre-clinical studies, 2) novel
experimental design to interrogate the link between renal metabolomic adaptations, oxidant formation, and
antioxidant responses in cisplatin-induced CKD mouse models; 3) the mitochondrially targeted SOD mimetic
(GC4419) currently pending approval by the US FDA in patients undergoing Cisplatin treatment, and
4) evaluating tubulointerstitial injury biomarkers to facilitate risk stratification strategies for future clinical trial
design. If successful, this proposal will translate into novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to promote
renal repair in cisplatin-induced kidney toxicity."

Adults incarcerated in the United States are disproportionately affected by substance use disorders and
chronic physical and mental conditions, and have a high risk of death after release from prison. Medicaid
coverage for formerly incarcerated adults increases access to care, but is likely insufficient by itself to
substantially improve outcomes without attending to the numerous social and structural barriers that make
accessing care difficult. Prior research demonstrates that formerly incarcerated adults under-utilize routine,
outpatient health care during the transition from prison to community living, suggesting a dire need for
systems-level interventions aimed at improving engagement in primary care. In a prior study funded by NIDA,
our team developed a hybrid, in-person and telephone-based nurse case management intervention that
bridges the pre-release and post-release period and conducted a single-arm pilot trial in two Wisconsin state
prisons. We found that the likelihood of an outpatient care visit shortly after release among those who received
the intervention was nearly double the baseline rate, while being highly acceptable to prison staff. In the
proposed Renewal Application, we will conduct a two-arm, randomized clinical trial among incarcerated adults
with a history of substance use, that compares previously piloted transitional case management intervention,
called CJC-TraC, to an enhanced usual care condition consisting of routine multi-disciplinary release planning
and provision of a free cellphone at the time of release. The primary and secondary trial outcomes are
attending an outpatient visit within 60-days of release for any cause and for a substance use disorder
respectively. In the proposed study’s second aim, we will leverage novel linked administrative data and
observational research methods to investigate care transition research questions that are policy-relevant but
cannot be pursued in a randomized trial of incarcerated adults: estimating the relative effectiveness of the trial
arms to usual care; assessing the generalizability of trial results to the target population; and measuring the
association between post-release outpatient care use and longer-run health and criminogenic outcomes.
Improving access to post-incarceration health care is a major federal policy priority. In 2023, the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid services published Section 1115 Medicaid demonstration waiver guidelines for states
to provide Medicaid coverage and care transition services to incarcerated individuals during the pre-release
period and post-incarceration. The waiver program represents an unprecedented opportunity to bring care
transition services for incarcerated individuals to scale; however, there is limited information identifying what
constitutes an effective and scalable care transition program. By testing the effect of a prison system-based
intervention able to be replicated and scaled up across multiple settings, findings from this study can have a
significant impact on the health of a high-priority, medically underserved population."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is
an evidence-based, cost-effective, and widely available multidisciplinary program that combines supervised
exercise with psychoeducation on health behavior change aimed at improving overall health and reducing
cardiovascular risk in individuals with established CVD. However, under-resourced and underserved CVD
patients (e.g., women, racial and ethnic minorities, low socioeconomic status, disabled) are less likely to
maintain their adherence to key cardioprotective behaviors (weight management, physical activity [PA], and
medication adherence) after CR and are under-represented in post-CR research; these factors combined
increase the health disparities in CVD care that these sub-populations experience, especially since many
cannot complete self-pay Phase III maintenance programs. In the PI’s previous work, under-resourced and
under-represented patients indicated that they want technology-based maintenance support interventions that
utilize technology they already own, are minimal burden, offer a flexible schedule, offer more support for
patient needs without overwhelming them with program requirements before demonstrating that a lower level
of support was insufficient, and produce desired results. Patients felt resistant to initiating a demanding, time-
intensive, or in-person maintenance intervention immediately following CR. The present application utilizes a
Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trial (SMART) design to create a stepped care model that
adapts to patient needs and minimizes patient burden. Participants (N=400) will be randomized to receive
either a low-intensity text messaging intervention or an automated online program for 2 months and determine
which produces superior adherence (Aim 1). Following classification as intervention responders or non-
responders, responders will continue receiving their initial low-intensity intervention. We will then determine
whether low- or high-intensity home-based CR (with or without case management) for 3 months produces
better behavioral adherence following failure of a low-intensity intervention failure (Aim 2). We will then finalize
the ideal adaptive intervention based on Aims 1 and 2 results and moderator analyses (Aim 3). Patients will
complete post-intervention assessments at 6 months and exploratory outcomes assessment (death,
rehospitalization, quality of life). This research will result in a stepped care model for under-resourced patients’
behavioral adherence maintenance following CR. This project advances the science of CVD treatment and
post-CR care, and it will directly impact CVD patient outcomes by extending the benefits of evidence-based,
effective care as well as target health disparities among less-resourced CVD patients."
10981803,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Inherited retinal degeneration (IRD) is a group of genetic diseases featuring progressive loss of
photoreceptor neurons in the retina and eventual blindness. Affected photoreceptors largely die through
apoptosis that was once thought to be irreversible. However, recent studies in different systems have reported
a phenomenon called “anastasis”, in which some cells that received an apoptotic signal become resilient and
return to a healthy state. The presence of resilient photoreceptor cells after light damage was suggested by
several studies, but there is no clear data on photoreceptors in retinal degeneration or knowledge of underlying
cellular/molecular mechanisms. This application aims to close this knowledge gap by testing our hypothesis that
each photoreceptor cell has an intrinsic capacity to “self-repair” or recover from apoptosis, and that therapeutic
treatments enhancing this capacity will maintain photoreceptors in IRDs.
To test our hypothesis, we will use mouse models to identify resilient vs. vulnerable rod/cone cells during
retinal degeneration. We have established an in vivo genetic tool, the living-color reporter mouse line, named
CaspBiosensors. In this model, we take advantage of a well-known apoptotic marker, activated Caspases 3/7
(Casp) to label cells that undergo apoptosis (present) with red fluorescence and cells that have survived
apoptosis (past) with green fluorescence. Our preliminary results demonstrate that we can detect present/past
Casp+ photoreceptors in a relevant model by both imaging in live animals and histological sections. In this grant,
we propose experiments to confirm and expand these findings at the cellular and molecular levels. Specific Aim
1 will determine the survival outcome of vulnerable (red) and resilient cells (green) under environmental (light
damage) and genetic (three IRD models) insults, using chronic in vivo imaging-based analyses complemented
by histological examination at end-points. Specific Aim 2 will identify molecular signatures of cellular resiliency
using single-cell RNA sequencing. We will validate selected candidate genes using loss-of-function and gain-of-
function manipulations. We will also investigate the capacity/mechanisms of gene therapy and a proven
neuroprotection reagent in preventing photoreceptors degeneration in IRD models.
The outcome of this research is expected to significantly impact our understanding of apoptotic
photoreceptor degeneration in IRDs and the development of more effective therapeutic approaches. Improving
long-term efficacy of gene therapy is essential as photoreceptors have continued to degenerate even in the few
successful ocular gene therapy clinical trials. Our study will inform potential improvements by adding
neuroprotection strategies to prolong the life of targeted photoreceptors."

Sexual problems are common, distressing and persistent for patients with gynecologic cancer (GC). Yet most
patients with GC who experience sexual concerns do not raise them with their clinicians, often due to a lack of
preparation for how to do so effectively. Negative beliefs, such as low self-efficacy for initiating discussions of
sexual health or expectations for the discussion, further limit patients’ active engagement in these discussions.
A patient-focused theory-guided intervention, Starting the Conversation (STC), could be ideally suited to address
these challenges and empower patients to drive clinical discussions to meet their needs. STC was developed
for use with breast cancer (BC) patients and found effective in that population. Compared to BC patients,
however, GC patients undergo different treatments, experience unique sexual health concerns, and have distinct
needs for a sexual health communication intervention. Therefore, we modified STC to suit the needs of women
with GC and conducted a pilot trial of the new intervention, called STC – Gynecologic Cancer (STC-GC), finding
strong support for its feasibility and acceptability. Before this intervention can be disseminated, its efficacy in the
target population must be evaluated. The primary objective of the proposed study is thus to evaluate the efficacy
of the STC-GC intervention among patients treated for GC reporting sexual concerns. Female patients with any
stage GC (N=200) will be randomized to receive either the STC-GC intervention [video, workbook, and resource
guide] or to a control [usual care plus resource guide]. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the efficacy of STC-GC in
facilitating patient clinical communication about sexual health (primary), assessed using rigorous dialogue
analysis of patients’ clinical communication about sexual health, and in improving patients’ sexual and
psychological health outcomes at post-intervention and 2- and 6-month follow-up (secondary). In Aim 2, we will
examine whether intervention-related increases in patients’ self-efficacy and outcome expectancies for sexual
health communication mediate effects of STC-GC on patients’ communication (Aim 2a) and whether enhanced
sexual health communication mediates effects of STC-GC on patients’ sexual and psychological health
outcomes (Aim 2b). In Aim 3, we will conduct in-depth qualitative interviews with a purposive sample of patients
in STC-GC and with clinicians of GC patients to provide information from multiple perspectives to contextualize
and interpret the quantitative findings of the trial. As the first efficacy trial of a sexual health communication
intervention for women with GC, findings from this study will be instrumental in advancing efforts to integrate
sexual health into routine cancer care. Further, the proposed study has a number of unique features, including
a qualitative investigation of multiple perspectives, novel application of dialogue analysis, analysis of multiple
intervention mediators, and a medically inclusive patient population, which heighten study impact and innovation.
Data from this study will serve as the platform for a future dissemination trial of STC-GC in multiple settings."

Obesity in reproductive-age women has sharply increased over the past few decades and is expected to continue
to rise for the foreseeable future. Besides a greater likelihood of pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia
and preterm birth, obese women are also more likely to experience severe pregnancy outcomes, including
maternal death. In obese women undergoing infertility treatment, reports of poor/delayed ovarian stimulation, a
higher frequency of in vitro fertilization (IVF) failure, and defects in placentation suggest that obesity negatively
affects multiple reproductive processes, but the mechanisms remain largely unknown. Studying these events in
humans is difficult due to ethical and technical limitations, as well as the challenge of controlling for confounding
environmental factors. Through a National Centers for Translational Research in Reproduction and Infertility
(NCTRI) grant, a cohort of rhesus macaque females receiving either a low-fat control diet or a high-fat Western-
Style Diet (WSD) was established to study the adverse effects of obesity and diet on reproductive function.
Fertility trials conducted with these females demonstrated that WSD consumption delayed the time to pregnancy
and was associated with multiple placental abnormalities. Each female then underwent an IVF cycle to determine
the impact of maternal diet on preimplantation embryogenesis. Blastocyst formation was significantly reduced in
the WSD group and preliminary RNA-seq data from these blastocysts revealed altered expression of genes
involved in critical peri-implantation processes. Considering the important role of epigenetic modifications in
regulating gene expression changes during embryonic and fetal development, here we propose to investigate
how maternal WSD-induced metabolic dysfunction impairs developmental programming at the molecular level
and whether it can be reversed after resuming a low-fat diet. First, we will assess if there are alterations in DNA
methylation, gene expression, and/or chromosome fidelity in preimplantation embryos from female macaques
with increased adiposity and insulin resistance induced by WSD exposure. By examining changes that persist
after a short versus long-term diet reversal, we will also determine whether it is a dietary intervention or overt
weight loss that can improve IVF outcomes (Aim 1). Secondly, we will utilize the fetal thymus, spleen, liver, and
kidney collected from low-fat diet and WSD-fed mothers during the NCTRI fertility trial to determine how maternal
diet and metabolism influences DNA methylation and gene expression across fetal tissues. Comparing these
results to the placenta, as well as maternal and cord blood, from the same subjects will help identify epigenetic
signatures that are trans-generationally shared versus fetus-specific (Aim 2). Further comparison of DNA
methylation and gene expression between embryos and fetuses will reveal genomic regions that are not only
important for development, but also susceptible to adverse metabolic conditions. Findings from this study will
provide insight into developmental reprogramming of the embryo, fetus, and placenta, as well as the reproductive
consequences of stable DNA methylation changes induced by a maternal WSD."

Pneumonia-derived sepsis remains a persistent and pervasive public health problem. Pneumonia and
sepsis are the major causes of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). No clinical studies other
than the ARDSnet ventilator trial provided better outcomes for ALI/ARDS. Therefore, an improved
understanding of the pathogenesis of pneumonia-derived sepsis is warranted. Despite the use of newer-
generation antibiotics to control pneumonia, the mortality rate of bacterial pneumonia has increased due
to multidrug-resistant and hypervirulent bacterial strains. Infections due to Enterobacteriaceae present a
public health threat due to the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains and limited available therapeutic
options. The acquisition of carbapenemeses by K. pneumoniae makes the bacteria resistant to all -
lactams. Moreover, there are no effective vaccines available to control carbapenem-resistant K.
pneumoniae (CRKP). Therefore, harnessing the host’s immune system may be a more effective strategy
for combating CRKP and developing novel treatment against this pathogen-induced devastating
diseases. The long-term goal is to understand the mechanism by which Nrf2 activation in the lung is
integrated into successful antibacterial resistance and if it is possible to reduce pulmonary and
extrapulmonary organ injury during CRKP infection through host-targeted therapies. My lab has made
substantial contributions toward understanding protective antibacterial defense against pulmonary
infection and pneumonia-induced sepsis. Bacterial pneumonia induces extensive oxidative stress in
pulmonary tissues. The transcription factor Nrf2 (nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2, Nfe2l2) is
a critical regulator of the expression of oxidative stress genes. The central hypothesis that Nrf2 is a
master regulator of host defense during CRKP-induced infection. Four aims have been proposed: Aim 1
will investigate the effects of Nrf2 on survival, bacterial clearance and neutrophil accumulation and
function, Aim 2 will explore the role of Nrf2 in emergency granulopoiesis, Aim 3 will characterize if Nrf2
ablation can alter the function of alveolar macrophages, and Aim 4 will determine if enhancing Nrf2
signaling in the lungs improve host defense. We will use both in vivo (mouse model) and in vitro (human
cells) strategies. We anticipate gaining a better understanding of the signaling cascades involved in the
innate responses to CRKP infection to design improved therapies to augment host defense and mitigate
collateral tissue damage."
10980165,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In mammals, majority of nitrogen waste is produced by gut microbiome in the form of ammonia. Ammonia is a
neurotoxin and is cleared by two major pathways: 1) conversion via the urea cycle enzymes (UCEs) into
nontoxic urea for excretion; and 2) assimilation into glutamate (Glu) by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) then
into glutamine (Gln) by glutamate ammonium ligase (GLUL), also termed glutamine synthetase (GS). In recent
years, UCEs and Glu/Gln synthesis have been found to be involved in tumor growth/development in various
tissues. Partially elevated UCE activities are implicated in tumor promotion via mechanisms such as enhanced
pyrimidine and polyamine production. Likewise, Glu/Gln biosynthesis is generally thought to be tumor-
promoting in various cancers. Curiously, while the liver is the main organ that handles ammonia waste, the
roles of the two ammonia handling pathways in liver cancer remain systematically unexplored. In
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the major histological subtype of liver cancer, UCE expression is often down-
regulated and correlates with worse prognosis, and GS expression is frequently elevated yet correlates with
better outcomes. Using mouse models of HCC driven by oncogenic -catenin, we recently reported that -
catenin led to decreased expression of UCEs and increased expression of GS. Increased ammonia levels
were observed in the plasma and tumor interstitial fluids, which were exacerbated by the ablation of hepatic
GS. These data indicate that oncogenic -catenin leads to the disruption of nitrogen homeostasis, and that
defective ammonia-clearance promotes HCC growth. The main goals of this application are to study the roles
of the UCEs in HCC, and to test the hypothesis that lowering ammonia burden can be a therapeutic strategy
for HCC treatment/prevention. We propose three Specific Aims. Aim1: Test the hypothesis that suppression of
UCE expression contributes to the growth of HCC driven by -catenin. This will be done by 1) overexpressing
or knocking down UCEs in various HCC mouse models; 2) studying the mechanism how down-regulation of
UCEs may promote HCC. Aim 2: Study how oncogenic -catenin regulates UCE transcription. We will test how
-catenin interacts with other transcription factors such as C/EBP and HNF4a, and test how they interact with
the UCE promoter/enhancer regions to regulate expression. Aim 3: testing that lowering ammonia burden can
be a therapeutic/preventive strategy for HCC. This will be done by feeding mice with low protein diet and test
the effect on growth signaling and HCC progression in vivo. Successful accomplishment of the project will
determine the role of UCEs in HCC, identify hyperammonemia as a risk factor, and help establish dietary
intervention as a strategy for treating/preventing HCC."
10988639,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Defining the forms of neural representation and temporal dynamics of neuron ensembles in the
hippocampus and related neocortical regions such as retrosplenial and entorhinal cortex has led
to a deep understanding of the brain’s ‘cognitive map’ of the environment. Such work has direct
relevance to understanding the pathologies and cognitive impairments attending neurological
disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease as well as intact learning and memory processes
associated with navigation, episodic memory, and orienting. The dorsal subiculum is highly
interconnected with these brain structures and important for normal spatial cognition, yet the
unique contributions it makes to the cognitive map and flexible navigation behavior have yet to
be defined. Prior work has suggested that subicular neurons are far less spatially-specific in
their firing activity than those of hippocampal area CA1, a brain region forming a prominent input
to subiculum. A role for subiculum in encoding and learning orientational relationships between
an organism and its environment has been suggested and is consistent with its receiving input
from the anterior thalamus. A major output target for subiculum is the retrosplenial cortex, a
region that contains neurons with left/right turn-related activity and which has been
hypothesized to form a transition of spatial cognition into action through projections to
secondary motor cortex. Our project is designed to systematically investigate orientation tuning
in the subiculum within environments where navigation is constrained to a network of
interconnected pathways. More specifically, we will examine the question of whether individual
subiculum neurons can encode multiple directions of travel as observed in preliminary data. The
experiments also address context-dependence and learning in orientation tuning. The work will
have implications for theories on function of the brain’s cognitive map. It is poised to identify a
system by which environmental locations affording transitions between two or more directions of
travel can be encoded with directional signals, which could drive left/right turning actions via
outputs to retrosplenial cortex. More broadly, the project is poised to form a new direction for
study of subicular function and the role of multi-directional tuning in spatial cognition."

Impaired ability to respond to the earth’s gravitational field and loss of balance results in high risk of falls with
adverse consequences for one’s health, quality of life, and health care costs to society. Falls are a particular
risk for individuals with Parkinson’s disease as well as elderly humans in general. Despite the importance of
gravity sensing to daily activities, the molecular, cellular, and circuit gravity sensing mechanisms are
incompletely understood. To understand gravity sensing mechanisms at the molecular and neural circuit level,
we use the simple microscopic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. C. elegans offers many experimental
advantages, including a small and simple nervous system, accessibility to rapid genetic manipulation and to
optogenetic tools, and ease of cultivation. We have demonstrated that C. elegans senses and responds to
gravity, and have used mutant analysis and pharmacology to show that one or more types of ciliated sensory
neurons, as well as dopamine, play a role in gravitytaxis. Our preliminary data leads to the hypothesis, which
we will test, that one or more of the three ciliated dopaminergic neurons types—CEP, ADE, and/or PDE—
mediates the response to gravity. We will use genetically-encoded synaptic transmission toxins as well as
genetically-encoded chemogenetic experiments to determine which of these 3 neuron types is required for the
response to gravity. We will identify additional neurotransmitters required for gravitaxis by testing animals
mutant for each of 4 neurotransmitter systems. We will test each of 58 C. elegans genes predicted to encode
mechanosensitive ion channels for a role in gravitaxis. Finally, we will make use of the million mutation project
to perform a pilot unbiased genetic screen for gravitaxis-defective mutants. In addition, we will develop a high
throughput sorter to isolate gravitaxis – deficient mutants for a future high throughput genetic screens for
additional gravitaxis defective mutants. At the completion of these studies, we will have identified one or more
dopaminergic neuron type as well as other neurotransmitters required for gravitaxis and we will have
developed the tools needed for further studies consistent with the objectives of this R21
exploratory/development funding mechanism. Our work will contribute to a comprehensive molecular
understanding of animals’ response to gravity and set the stage for the development of novel therapeutics to
reduce falls."
10989286,"Compared to non-Hispanic Whites (NHW), African Americans (AAs) are 20% more likely to get colorectal cancer
(CRC) and 40% more likely to die from CRC. The negative impacts of health inequity on CRC incidence and
mortality are undeniable, though it is becoming clear that ancestry-specific tumor biology also plays a significant
role. A greater understanding of ancestry specific biology on CRC etiology is required if we are to fully elucidate
its true contribution to cancer disparity, ATG16L1 is critical for LC3 lipidation and autophagosome formation.
ATG16L1 isoforms show ancestry specific expression in CRC tissue. Alanine homozygosity at residue 300 of
ATG16L1 (A300A) is more predominant in NHWs and threonine homozygosity at the same residue (T300T) is
more predominant in AA’s. In CRC, the A300A genotype is associated with reduced metastasis and increased
overall survival and the T300T genotype is associated with increased risk of CRC. Using isogenic CRC cells, we
found that chemotherapies that enhance autophagy show more therapeutic efficacy in T300T cells than more
established cytotoxic based chemotherapies which have more cell killing efficacy in the A300A isoform.
Collectively, these data suggest that isoform status of ATG16L1 promote aggressive CRC and represent a key
pivotal biomarker to stratify CRC treatment response in relation to autophagic function. Our hypothesis is “that
the ATGL16L T300T isoform is a prognostic indicator of response in AA CRC patients and represents a
predictive treatment biomarker for treatment decisions and help to reduce disparate outcomes.”
Specific Aim 1. Determine whether ATG16L1 isoforms differentially promote aggressive CRC growth and
metastasis in vivo. Using isogenic male and female ATG16L1 T300T and ATG16L1 A300A mice we will
chemically induce colitis-associated tumors using azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS).10
Following AOM / DSS exposure, we will determine tumor number, size, and location in T300T and A300A mice.
Male and female Apc min/+ mice that are ATG16L1 T300T will be cross-bred with ATG16L1 A300A mice.11 We
will isolate tumor epithelial cells and stromal fibroblasts from tumors arising from transgenic mice over time,
define alterations in their molecular biology and establish novel cell lines.12,13 This aim will inform on the biological
mechanisms promoting aggressive tumor growth and metastasis in patients with the different ATG16L1 isoforms.
Specific Aim 2. Determine whether the T300T isoform predicts tumor response and improves outcome
to combination-treatment regimens that target autophagy in pre-clinical isogenic mouse tumor models.
The response of male and female murine colorectal tumors using cells isolated from Aim 1 will be defined in
either T300T or A300A mice, to drug combinations that utilize autophagy to kill, or where autophagy reduces
drug efficacy. This will define the importance of T300T or A300A isoform expression with respect to both the
tumor epithelial cells and to the autophagic competency of the tumor microenvironment. This aim will inform on
why AA CRC patients have poorer responses to standard of care therapies resulting in worse outcomes."
10995780,"Decreased visual ability in veterans quickly leads to functional impairment and with it, reduced quality of
life. In the year 2016 eye care was the third busiest clinical service in the VA Health Care system and 490,926
veterans receiving care at Veterans Affairs medical centers were given a glaucoma-related diagnosis. The
most common type of the disease is primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), and the major risk factor for
POAG is high intraocular pressure (IOP). Medical treatment is life-long and poor patient compliance presents a
significant obstacle to successful care, motivating the need for novel safe, effective and sustained IOP control
therapies. This project is designed with the long-term goal of regenerating the natural ability of the eye to
regulate IOP.
 The trabecular meshwork (TM) is a key regulator of IOP and has been shown to undergo significant
changes in POAG, including a loss of cells. This, in turn, causes failure of the tissue to carry out its functions
and a subsequent rise in IOP. This motivates the use of cell therapy to restore TM function as a potential long-
term treatment for POAG.
 Our studies have demonstrated that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) can be differentiated into a cell
type that resembles primary TM cells morphologically, compositionally, and functionally. Transplantation of
these cells, designated iPSC-TM, into the eyes of mouse models of glaucoma causes re-celluarization of the
TM, decreased IOP, and prevention of vision loss. This approach has also been shown to reliably increase TM
cellularity in ex-vivo organ culture of human eyes obtained from older donors. These findings are extremely
encouraging and suggest that restoration of TM function through iPSC-TM transplantation is possible.
However, crucial aspects of iPSC-TM cell therapy require further development before translation into clinical
practice can be considered. These include: (1) Increased targeting efficiency of transplanted material to the
TM, which will reduce the number of injected cells and decrease off-target effects; (2) evaluation of the
effectiveness and safety of allotransplants to reduce, which could reduce costs and increase quality of
transplanted cells; and (3) direct demonstration that iPSC-TM cell therapy is effective in human eyes with
POAG maintained in organ culture. Successful completion of our studies would provide a very strong rationale
for future clinical trials.
 The proposed studies are highly innovative since they investigate a completely novel approach to
permanently repair, rather than treat, glaucomatous damage in veterans. These studies will have an important
impact since this unique and novel approach has the potential to profoundly alter clinical practice. Lasting
functional restoration will reduce clinic visits and costs for the VA health care system, provide physicians with a
new treatment option, and will help veterans through better vision and increased quality of life."
10995527,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The basal ganglia (BG), a set of highly interconnected nuclei deep in the brain, are critical to normal
motor and cognitive functioning in humans; diseases of the BG impair everyday life for people with
Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dystonia. Studies from non-human primates and rodents have suggested
that during well-learned motor sequences the BG send transition signals to cortex via thalamus to stop
the execution of one motor chunk and start the next. In this study, we will the hypothesis that the BG
send transition signals during speech production, one of the most complex discrete motor behaviors.
We will leverage the rare opportunity to record from human BG during deep brain stimulation (DBS)
surgeries. DBS brain region targets include the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the globus pallidus
internus (GPi), both important nodes in the BG. Most previous studies analyzing these intraoperative
intracranial recordings have focused on the STN. This project will extend empirical evidence available
for the role of the GPi (the primary output nucleus of the BG) in human behavior. Analyzing high
spatiotemporal local field potentials from the GPi during a speech production task, will test the
hypothesis that the BG send transition signals at the end of each motor chunk in a sequence of well-
learned chunks (Aim 1). Preliminary data are concordant with prior hypotheses about the level at which
speech motor chunks are coded in the BG—at the syllable level, as opposed to at the phone or phrase
level. In Aim 2, we will advance the DIVA/GODIVA computational model of speech production with
three main areas of development: designing distinct STN and GPi modules, constraining the speech
motor chunk size of the BG according to Aim 1 findings, and modeling the BG learning the appropriate
sensorimotor context for each speech motor chunk.
In sum, this project proposes to bring together a) human speech production intracranial recordings of
the BG during deep brain stimulation implantation surgery from the Brain Modulation Lab (Mass
General Hospital) and b) speech computational modeling from the Speech Neuroscience Lab (Boston
University). These two areas will work synergistically in that human intracranial data is in need of
constrained hypotheses and speech computational modeling is in need of time-resolved empirical data
from the BG. The proposed project will contribute to the NIDCD’s mission to advance our understanding
of the neural basis of speech production by leveraging unique data and principled modeling. The
training strategy in this project is also uniquely promising to advance NIDCD’s mission to support cross-
disciplinary communication science research careers that bridge laboratory research and patient care;
my goal is to become an independent researcher in speech neuroscience."
10978959,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a devastating muscle disease caused by the
inappropriate expression of an early embryonic transcription factor, DUX4, in the skeletal muscle. DUX4
activates hundreds of genes in muscle cells and eventually induces toxicity. Which of the DUX4-driven gene
expression changes underlie its pathogenicity is currently unknown. Our previous research has shown that
DUX4 significantly affects RNA metabolism in muscle cells. Specifically, DUX4 induces altered splicing and
proteasome-mediated loss of RNA quality control, with a resultant increase in aberrant transcripts that encode
potentially toxic, truncated proteins. Hence, we hypothesize that DUX4-induced misregulation of RNA
metabolism is a key driver of its pathogenicity in FSHD.
To test this hypothesis, we seek to determine the mechanistic underpinnings of how DUX4 increases aberrant
RNAs in the cell. We will do so by determining the mechanism of DUX4-induced aberrant splicing (Aim 1) and
identifying factors that induce loss of RNA quality control via the ubiquitin-proteasome system upon DUX4
expression (Aim 2). We will use a combination of biochemistry, genome engineering, proteomics, and
genomics to address these questions in a temporally controlled, inducible DUX4 expression system.
Successful completion of these studies will allow us to determine how DUX4, a transcription factor, rewires the
post-transcriptional gene regulatory network of muscle cells. Given that perturbed RNA metabolism is a
common mechanism underlying many muscle diseases, a better understanding of its role in FSHD could also
aid in novel therapeutic discovery."

SUMMARY
This P20 application proposes to establish the Cincinnati Climate Change and Health Research Center
(C3HRC). The central theme of our proposed exploratory center is to examine health outcomes of climate
change-driven exposures to heat, pathogenic microbes, and environmental toxicants, and to identify novel
interventions that promote resiliency in vulnerable populations. Our focus is on the climate-related changes
occurring in our own urban area and elsewhere: Rising temperatures, increased precipitation, and extreme
weather (tornadic and flooding) events. Our investigations of climate change-driven exposures and health
outcomes will be translational, with the goal of developing and testing novel interventions in community and
clinical settings. Our attention to vulnerable populations focuses on first responders and low-income as well as
historically marginalized communities. Consistent with the goals of the Climate Change and Health Research
Centers, the C3HRC will: 1) plan and develop sustainable research capacity by establishing centralized
resources and research infrastructure; 2) develop the Center’s thematic focus and transdisciplinary research
activities on climate change-driven impacts on health in vulnerable populations; 3) enable research that develops
into new programs of science and research applications supporting independent investigators; 4) cultivate
authentic partnerships to engage communities most likely to be impacted by climate change in all phases of the
research process; and 5) actively participate in the NIH Research Coordinating Center to Support Climate
Change and Health Community of Practice activities. C3HRC is led by senior, established investigators and a
transdisciplinary team of experts in exposure science, thermal biology, microbial ecology, infectious disease,
epidemiology, pediatrics, internal medicine, allergy and immunology, lung biology, ergonomics, toxicology,
environmental engineering, bioinformatics, biostatistics, health communication, community engagement, and
design, architecture, and planning. Our Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives (PEDP) is woven into all
aspects of the Center. Health equity research will be prioritized in our projects. Training and capacity building
will be addressed by nourishing strong academic-community partnerships; mentoring and supporting junior and
Early Career Investigators; pilot projects and trainee awards; a climate change and health graduate certificate
program; diverse research teams; providing researchers with current information through a seminar series and
newsletter and curated educational materials and grant opportunities. In the 3-year period of this award, the
C3HRC will support one transdisciplinary research project: The impact of extreme heat on mucosal immunity.
The three cores will be: 1) Administrative; 2) Development; and 3) Community Engagement. This proposal builds
on the many strengths of the University of Cincinnati and our community partners to achieve transformative
research that addresses the core elements of the NIH Initiative in Climate Health Research: Health effects
research, intervention research, health equity, training and capacity building."

to enable communication among center members and partners; b) Support member capacity for transformative
research on climate change and health through information-sharing and active development of collaborations;
c) Actively incorporate alternative perspectives by enacting our Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives; and d)
Develop and enact a Plan for Center Development and Sustainability, which addresses what the C3HRC aims
to develop and achieve by the end of P20 support to attract funding and long-term success. Aim 3. Provide
effective management of the C3HRC, including utilization of funds, monitor and enable productivity, and ensure
compliance with regulatory requirements. Under this aim, this core will: a) Oversee the center budget and review
expenditure of funds monthly, assuring the timely expenditure of these funds, and identifying additional resource
needs; b) enact center-wide data management and resource sharing plans; c) assure regulatory compliance;
and d) monitor center productivity in terms of publications, grants submitted and awarded and meeting evaluation
milestones. The Administrative Core is committed to leveraging NIH and institutional resources to foster an
environment that contributes high impact research on climate-related health effects, health equity, strategies for
adaptation and resilience, and workforce development. The research environment at our institution is exceptional
and highly conducive to the development of team science and groundbreaking discoveries."

Climate change is causing a marked increase in ambient temperatures in specific regions, especially in US
Midwest cities, leading to a heightened risk of heat-related illness (HRI). Notably, individuals' susceptibility to
HRI severity and recovery varies due to several factors, including age, social determinants of health, and
underlying health conditions. Given these variations, a personalized approach to risk management is imperative
to mitigate the adverse consequences of HRI. This project will explore the effects of heat stress among at-risk
populations including firefighters and elderly individuals residing in neighborhoods vulnerable to the effects of
climate change using a combination of self-reported data, wearable sensors, and transcriptomic signatures in
the following aims: Aim 1: Determine variation in severity of biometric responses and HRI in firefighters at the
time of live burn training and its prediction of biometric measures during the week following exposure. Before,
during, and for 3 h after training, core body temperature (CBT), heart rate (HR), and heart rate variability (HRV)
will be measured in 24 firefighters. Neurological assessments will include fatigue/body discomfort and sleepiness
surveys, postural balance, gait function and dual task tests. Whole blood and nasal swabs will be collected 1
week before, immediately after, and 3 days after exposure. Aim 2. Determine the association between exposure
to elevated temperature and humidity and HRI among susceptible elderly individuals as measured by self-
reported symptoms and smartwatch biometrics. A panel study will be conducted involving elderly individuals
(>50yr, n=48) living in neighborhoods vulnerable to the effects of climate change due to poor tree canopy
coverage, decreased community socioeconomic position and resources, and high percentage of racially
marginalized populations. In-home temperature and humidity, weekly smartwatch biometrics and heat-related
health questionnaires will be collected. Nasal swabs will be obtained for analysis in Aim 3. Aim 3. Determine
whether nasal transcriptomic signatures can predict heat-related illness in individuals with increased
susceptibility to climate change extreme heat. Changes in nasal transcriptomics will be assessed within-subject
using specimens obtained before and after an extreme heat event [live burn training (Aim 1) or heat waves (Aim
2)]. RNA sequencing will be performed on firefighter whole blood and nasal and community member nasal
specimens. Using biometric variables for classification, we will compare responders from non-responders with
similar heat exposures and compare their transcriptomes. Understanding the transcriptomic signature of heat
stress and its implications for both firefighters and vulnerable populations in heat-affected neighborhoods is of
high significance and potential for public health impact. This research addresses the immediate health risks
posed by rising temperatures and contributes to the development of personalized risk management strategies.
By identifying biomarkers and susceptibility factors, this study paves the way for targeted interventions, ultimately
enhancing public health preparedness in escalating climate challenges."
10983139,"COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT CORE
SUMMARY
The overarching goal of the CEC is to align the research practices of the Cincinnati Climate Change and Health
Research Center with the diverse climate change-related needs of our community members and organizations.
Through authentic connections and innovative approaches, this Core will identify and promote community-
supported strategies for health resilience in the populations that are most vulnerable to the effects of climate
change. The CEC recognizes the expertise of community members and academics and is guided by an asset-
rather than deficit-based approach to community engagement. The aims of this core are three-fold: 1) to engage
diverse regional organizations and marginalized communities in order to understand their perceptions of the
health concerns related to climate change and their climate resilience; 2) to facilitate and support community-
academic collaborations; and 3) to optimize multidirectional science communication between the center and the
public. These aims and approaches will enable the overall efforts of the Cincinnati Climate Change and Health
Research Center (C3HRC) including the Center’s Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives and academic-
community collaborations on climate change. The co-Directors of this Core are deeply experienced in
complementary community engagement work. Their efforts will be enriched by the inclusion of two major
community-based non-profit organizations dedicated to climate and environmental justice, and a cadre of
academics from three institutions that have a history of environmental research and community engagement.
Under aim 1, a Community Advisory Board (CAB) will be created that brings together this wealth of capacity,
inclusive of new partners, to create a strategic plan for engagement and outreach that links the efforts of
community groups and academics, and identifies the climate change and health-related needs perceived by the
community. Under aim 2, this Core will enact, in collaboration with the Development Core, a Grassroots Awards
program that provides grants for community-led projects that engage academic partners (awards will range from
$2000-$5000 each). And under aim 3, this Core will enact a hub for multidirectional science communication
linking the center and the public. That will include training for students and academics in community engagement,
“climate cafes” that enable relaxed presentation and discussion of scientific research on climate change and
health with interested community members, and review and feedback from CEC academic and community
members on proposed scientific communications from the Center and its members to ensure that scientific
communications are clear and useful for community organizations and members. This Core has key
responsibilities to the success of the overall center.

 The Chemistry and Biology of Tetrapyrroles Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and Gordon Research
Seminar (GRS) is the biggest and most diverse international meeting for sharing and discussing the latest
research on tetrapyrroles, a diverse group of protein cofactors and metabolites which include heme, cobalamin
(vitamin B12), chlorophyll, and bilins. Tetrapyrroles serve as important cofactors to control essential cellular

signaling and regulatory molecules in normal and disease states. Both the GRC and GRS are the leading
conferences to present new unpublished tetrapyrrole related research findings and gather international scientists
ranging from senior scientists to early stage investigators (ESI) and trainees in both formal and informal
environments. Both the GRC and GRS will facilitate the creation of new connections and collaborations to
advance the chemistry and biology of tetrapyrroles and foster an inclusive environment for the development of
diverse scientists in an equitable and open setting.
 The 2024 GRC and GRS meetings will be held from July 13 - 19, 2024 at Salve Regina University in Newport,
RI. The Chemistry & Biology of Tetrapyrroles GRC and GRS are one of a kind in terms of the international and
diverse audience that they attract. The diversity of topics discussed span from clinical to biological to chemical
aspects of tetrapyrroles and the range of organisms from bacteria to plants to humans. The 2024 GRC and GRS
will highlight recent data from a variety of researchers at different levels in the following areas: trafficking
tetrapyrroles; synthesis and metabolism of tetrapyrroles; tetrapyrroles and disease; tetrapyrroles in the
environment, energy production and light harvesting; tetrapyrroles in signaling; tetrapyrroles in medicine;
tetrapyrroles in chemistry and catalysis; tetrapyrrole protein structure and assembly; and lessons in tetrapyrrole
metabolism. Given the critical roles that tetrapyrroles play in human health and disease including infectious
diseases, inflammation, diabetes, kidney disease, porphyrias, anemias, and obesity, understanding the
metabolism, trafficking, and homeostasis of tetrapyrroles is crucial for human health."

Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled T Cell Differentiation in Tissue
Microenvironments, organized by Drs. Greg Delgoffe, Amanda Lund, Nikhil Joshi and Laura Mackay. The
conference will be held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada from February 2–6, 2025.
Normal and pathological immune responses function across tissues that harbor unique metabolic,
environmental, and cellular microenvironments. Therefore, the mechanisms that recruit and activate leukocytes,
define their interstitial function and survival, or promote their retention in particular tissues are crucial to
understanding how to boost, redirect, or restrict immune responses across the spectrum of health and disease.
While the topic of tissue specific immunity has been touched on in other meetings, this is the first conference to
integrate discussion across diverse tissues and disease contexts. The program will cover how various tissues
shape the immune responses that are generated within, while highlighting emerging technologies that are
enabling advancements in this field. The speaker lineup will attract a vast array of multidisciplinary scientists
thinking about T cell differentiation in tissues in the context of diverse diseases, such as cancer, autoimmunity,
and infection. In addition, as a joint meeting with the Keystone Symposia conference on Innate Immune Memory:
Mechanisms and Consequences, the intersections of audiences and researchers will enable dynamic crosstalk,
cross-disciplinary insights and collaboration towards understanding the interconnectedness of innate and
adaptive immunity, and interplay with tissue microenvironments."

Even though psychosocial distress is recognized as a key component of cancer-related treatment and
survivorship, a 2022 review found that only 54.8% of cancer patients are screened for psychosocial distress, and
Hispanic survivors were screened at lower percentages. The mental health impact of cancer is significantly worse
for Latinos than for non-Hispanic Whites. Overall cancer-related disparities for Latina/os are disproportionately
higher in Texas and the U.S. as compared to their peers. Health outcomes in counties around the Rio Grande
Valley (RGV), a majority Hispanic population, fall in the bottom third of national health rankings, indicating lower
access to care in general and higher unmitigated risk in health behaviors, health conditions such as cancer, and,
access to mental health. Behavioral health integration in primary care is a reasonable solution to exponentially
increase access to behavioral health services for patients and to support the already overwhelmed Primary Care
Provider (PCP) workforce. The Alleviating Social and Psychological Ill-being Research and Evaluation (ASPIRE)
study will implement the Primary Care Behavioral Health (PCBH) integration model in two underserved primary
care clinics in the RGV, aimed at increasing access to behavioral health services for all health needs, with a
targeted approach to eliminating disparities in mental health support for cancer survivors and patients. As a
health services research initiative, the study will use the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation Fidelity,
and Maintenance (RE-AIM) dissemination and implementation framework to examine the overall impact of PCBH
services. Using a pragmatical trial approach, we will also evaluate a targeted, 5-visit psychological flexibility
intervention impact on psychological and biological markers. Finally, we will use focus groups with patients and
providers to examine the acceptability of PCBH services and interventions. The PCBH service aims to impact all
biopsychosocial health-related needs in primary care and aims to help the populations efficiently self-manage
their acute and chronic health conditions. Primary Care Behavioral Health (PCBH) integration is the most
promising solution to mitigate fragmentation in care and advance timely access to behavioral health care in the
RGV."

(as stated in parent grant)
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a devastating form of pancreatic cancer with
dismal patient outcome. KRAS, which is commonly mutated in PDAC, is a driving oncogene in
this disease. However, development of approaches to target KRAS has proven challenging and
inhibitors targeting signaling networks downstream of KRAS such as the MAPK pathway have
largely failed as single agents. The overall goal of this proposal is to use innovative chemical
strategies to identify combination regimens in PDAC, which are urgently needed to improve
patient survival. Combining CRISPR screens and epigenomic profiling, I identified that the
YAP/TAZ/TEAD axis is a critical transcriptional node required for the bypass survival program
upon KRAS loss or MEK inhibition. This data and published literature support the importance of
directly targeting the YAP/TAZ/TEAD axis in PDAC. However, current YAP/TAZ/TEAD
inhibitors have poor potency and off-target effects and genetic strategies to study critical
transcription regulators have limited utility due to delays between protein loss and experimental
measurement. To overcome these limitations, I developed a versatile tag-based technology
platform known as the degradation tag (dTAG) system to induce rapid degradation of any target
protein in cell lines and mouse models. The dTAG system enables evaluation of target protein
loss with a small molecule degrader in a time-scale that is not possible with genetic
approaches, facilitating evaluations of mutant KRAS, YAP and TAZ. In addition, the Gray
laboratory developed a selective small molecule covalent TEAD inhibitor to irreversibly
inactivate aberrant YAP/TAZ/TEAD signaling. The work proposed in this application will
leverage the dTAG technology platform and a covalent TEAD inhibitor to establish the role of
YAP/TAZ/TEAD in coordinating bypass survival in PDAC. In Aim 1, in the absence of direct
YAP or TAZ inhibitors, I will use the dTAG system to define the direct YAP and TAZ
transcriptional signaling program that promotes survival upon modulation of KRAS signaling.
These experiments will demonstrate the potential of chemical degradation of YAP and TAZ and
identify novel targetable vulnerabilities. In Aim 2, I will use PDAC cell lines and patient-derived
organoid models to evaluate the translational potential of covalent TEAD inhibition as a
combination regimen with KRAS signaling disruption. Integrating chemical biology, genome-
scale analyses, and translational models of PDAC, I expect that PDAC-specific therapeutic
insights will emanate from this work. To achieve these aims, I designed a 3-year plan that
includes participation in scientific and career development meetings, workshops and coursework
to further develop my cancer chemical biology and computational biology expertise. This career
transition award will greatly facilitate my goal of leading a multidisciplinary research laboratory
focused on addressing challenges in the treatment of pancreatic cancer."

11003902,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In the U.S., over 20,000 heart transplants are needed each year, but fewer than 4,000 procedures are performed
despite the yearly availability of more than 12,000 donors. This gap exists because 6 hearts from every 10
organ donors are unused. The vast majority of eligible donor hearts are rejected because the transport time is
limited to 4 hours. To address this unmet need, Nour Heart developed and patented the bioenergetic
cardioprotective drug, Nourexal™ (Cyclocreatine Phosphate (CCrP)), which was recently granted FDA Orphan
Drug Designation for “Prevention of Ischemic Injury to Enhance Cardiac Graft Recovery and Survival in Heart
Transplantation” (DRU-2015-4951). CCrP enhances myocardial energy stores during ischemia, reduces cell
injury, inhibits inflammation and fibrosis, and restores normal cardiac function after extended cold storage of rat
and dog hearts. Further, injection of CCrP (1.2 gm/kg) into rat donors, protected hearts during harvesting and
allowed prolonged storage for 22 hours with full recovery of surgically grafted hearts for 3 days.
In this two-year Direct-to-Phase II SBIR project, Nour Heart, Inc. (NHI) will prepare and file an Investigational
New Drug (IND) for FDA approval to initiate CCrP Phase I safety trial in human healthy volunteers. Based on
the FDA response to NHI’s Pre-IND application (PIND 125867), we will: 1) produce Good Manufacturing Practice
(GMP) grade CCrP and determine its Chemistry Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) (Aim 1); 2) conduct FDA-
recommended, IND-enabling CCrP preclinical safety studies in rats, dogs, and human unused cadaver donors
(UCDs) (Aim 2) (initial rat studies indicated that CCrP is a safe drug); 3) conduct a pilot in vivo efficacy study in
pigs to confirm the ability of CCrP to safely extend cold storage time of pig hearts to 6 hours before surgically
transplanting the graft into recipient pigs (Aim 3). This pig study will be overseen by Dr. O.H. Frazier at the Texas
Heart Institute to test the therapeutic benefits of our patented “three-step clinical protocol” where CCrP will be
administered only once to heart donors and not to recipients; and 4) prepare CCrP Phase I safety protocol,
investigational brochure, as well as assemble and file Nour Heart’s IND application to the FDA for an indication
for end-stage heart failure patients scheduled for heart transplantation procedures (Aim 4). We expect CCrP to
be safe in rats, dogs, and human unused cadaver donors and can preserve cardiac function in the pig heart
transplantation model. As a novel bioenergetic cardioprotective drug, CCrP will potentially increase the time and
distance that the hearts can be transported, thus extending transplantation to eligible recipient candidates
located outside the current 4-hour transport limit. Upon successful completion of this project, Nour Heart plans
to commercialize CCrP by raising capital to conduct CCrP Phase I safety trial, via two venture capital groups,
who have indicated interest, or to partner with Rallybio pharmaceuticals. Future broader use of CCrP that can
safely extend transport time (>4 hours), could significantly reduce the number of unused donor hearts & expand
supply of useable human donor hearts, thus, potentially increase heart transplant cases by over 3,000 yearly."
11005150,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 There continues to be an overarching problem of high mortality and poor outcome for
victims of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Preclinical and clinical investigations indicate that
hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) has a positive impact on reducing brain injury and improving
outcomes in severe TBI. By markedly increasing oxygen (O2) delivery to the traumatized brain,
HBO2 can reverse the lack of O2 that precipitates cellular energy failure and subsequent brain
cell death. In past clinical investigations, HBO2 in comparison to standard care has significantly
improved energy production in the brain and improved clinical outcome. However, prior to a
formal phase III definitive efficacy study, important information is required regarding optimizing
the HBO2 treatment schedule to be instituted in terms of pressure and frequency and other
parameters. The lungs in severe TBI patients have frequently been compromised by direct lung
injury and/or acquired ventilator pneumonia and are susceptible to O2 toxicity. It is essential to
determine the most effective HBO2 dose schedule without producing O2 toxicity and clinical
complications. This proposed adaptive clinical trial is designed to answer these questions and
to provide important data to plan a definitive phase III efficacy trial.
 Primary aims of this trial are to select, in patients with severe TBI, the combination of
HBO2 treatment parameters that is most likely to demonstrate improvement in the outcome of
severe TBI patients in a subsequent phase III trial. Also the trial will determine, in patients with
severe TBI, whether there is a > 50% probability of HBO2 treatment demonstrating
improvement in the outcome of severe TBI in a subsequent confirmatory phase III trial.
 This trial is supported and sponsored by the Neurological Emergency Treatment Trial
(NETT) Network which is funded by the National Institutes of Neurologic Disease and Stroke to
conduct clinical trials such as the one described. The NETT helps ensure a well-planned and
well-conducted clinical trial."
11006040,"Despite great advances in AIDS diagnosis and treatment, the continuing AIDS epidemic demands
continuing efforts to understand all aspects of HIV replication and to develop new methods for its inhibition.
In pursuit of these goals, we have sought to define the activities and interactions of the HIV-1 structural
(Gag) proteins, with a specific focus on the N-terminal matrix (MA) domain. The Gag proteins initially are
synthesized as precursor Gag (PrGag) proteins that are myristoylated at the N-terminus of MA, and MA
domains target PrGag delivery to plasma membrane (PM) virus assembly sites virtue of preferential binding
to the signaling phospholipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI[4,5]P2). Evidence also indicates that
MA-RNA binding helps chaperone PrGag proteins to assembly sites, and that virus membranes are
enriched for lipid raft constituents such as cholesterol, sphingomyelin, and ceramide. In addition to its
trafficking role, MA has been shown to influence the incorporation of wild type (WT) HIV-1 envelope (Env)
glycoprotein trimers into virus particles. Previous investigations have shown that HIV-1 Env proteins that
carry cytoplasmic tail deletions (CT) in their transmembrane (TM; gp41) domains can be incorporated into
virions in a fashion that is cell type-dependent, but MA-independent. In contrast, MA mutations that impair
WT Env incorporation into virions have been identified. Moreover, other MA mutations have been shown to
suppress Env incorporation defects imposed either by MA mutations, or Env CT mutations. Such
observations imply that there could be direct MA-CT interactions, but proof has been lacking. During the
past funding period, we have made significant progress in understanding how MA and Env proteins interact.
We have shown that MA directly binds to Env CTs, and that binding depends on MA trimerization. We have
demonstrated that C-terminal amphipathic helices of HIV-1 Env CTs are involved in MA binding, and that
MA-CT binding is blocked by MA-RNA binding. We have discovered lipid composition changes that perturb
WT Env activity, and have obtained novel evidence of CT processing. Using this as a foundation, we
propose the characterization of MA-CT interactions and the roles of these interactions in HIV-1 replication.
In particular, we will define how Env proteins associate with MA trimers and lattices so as to determine how
WT Env proteins become incorporated into virus particles; and we will examine how Gag and Env proteins
collaborate in virus particles to perform their functions. Our results will help clarify how HIV Gag and Env
proteins cooperate, and will foster the development of novel approaches to interfere with HIV-1 replication."
11005466,"Progressive Osseous Heteroplasia (POH:MIM#166350) is an ultra-rare genetic disease of
heterotopic ossification (HO) that is associated with inactivating mutations in the GNAS1 gene,
which encodes for Gαs, that acts downstream of many G-protein coupled receptors in activating
adenyl cyclase.1 Clinically, POH presents during infancy with dermal and subcutaneous
ossifications, which progress during childhood into skeletal muscles and deep connective and soft
tissues (e.g., tendon, ligaments, fascia). Over time, these ossifications lead to joint stiffness, bone
and joint fusions, and growth retardation of the affected limbs. The aberrant Hedgehog pathway
(Hh) signaling leads to a rapid and progressive endochondral heterotopic ossification (EHO) in
skeletal muscle and connective tissues as a hallmark of the POH. Therefore, there are no
treatments for POH under clinical development that are acutely acting and/or supplied locally.
Nostopharma seeks to address this need by creating locally administered, small volume,
extended-release formulations of Hh inhibitors as a promising approach to achieve a therapeutic
effect, dose, and toxicity reduction. The objective for this preclinical proof of concept is to
demonstrate the feasibility of eliminating systemic drug exposure and repurposing of clinically
tested and previously authorized inhibitors of endochondral bone formation, such as Hh signaling
inhibitors, formulated in a proprietary way, to treat a rare genetic disease-POH. Hedgehog
signaling (Hh) has a seminal role in mesenchymal progenitor fate choice and inappropriate
differentiation into osteoblasts and ectopic bone formation in soft tissues. Although arsenic
trioxide (ATO), a highly potent Hh inhibitor, can directly block osteogenesis, chronic or systemic
delivery is not an option for POH patients due to recognized side effects in tissues that are not
the intended target. To circumvent these restricting side effects, a proprietary formulation of ATO
encapsulated in immunomodulatory nanoparticles will be tested. This proof of concept will involve
screening of dose and frequency in vitro using POH mouse isolated subcutaneous progenitor
cells."

Developing novel therapeutics to treat the core cognitive deficits (e.g. working memory) in individuals with
schizophrenia (SZ) remains a major unmet need. Working memory depends, in part, on properly timed activation
of layer 3 pyramidal neurons in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). In particular, this DLPFC microcircuit
appears to be crucial for filtering out distracting stimuli during working memory tasks. Convergent experimental
and computational data suggest that successful filtering of distractors occurs through inhibition onto pyramidal
neuron dendrites by somatostatin (SOM)-expressing GABA neurons. Thus, the widely replicated findings of
lower SOM mRNA expression in gray matter samples from SZ subjects implicate altered GABA signaling from
SOM neurons as potential contributors to the neural basis for working memory dysfunction in the illness. The
few studies which have been conducted on SOM neurons in SZ consistently demonstrate lower SOM mRNA
expression in total gray matter DLPFC samples as well as a lower density of neurons positive for SOM mRNA.
These prior findings raise key questions about these alterations: first, does a lower density of SOM-expressing
neurons in the DLPFC of SZ subjects reflect fewer total SOM neurons in the illness or a failure of a subset of
these neurons to express SOM mRNA? Second, do SOM neurons exhibit a diminished capacity to synthesize
GABA, indexed by lower expression of the principal GABA synthesizing enzyme, GAD67? We propose to
address these questions utilizing novel multiplex fluorescent in-situ hybridization, relying on the use of Sox6 as
a proxy marker for SOM neurons while measuring SOM and GAD67 mRNA levels in a cell-type specific manner.
We predict that the density of SOM neurons is unaltered in SZ and that SOM and GAD67 mRNA levels per
neuron are lower (Aim 1). Third, upstream factors which contribute to lower SOM mRNA in SOM neurons residing
in layers 2-superficial 3, but not those not deep 6-white matter, are unknown, but likely reflect microcircuit
abnormalities. Both SOM and GAD67 mRNA expression levels are positively associated with activity levels.
Layer 3 pyramidal neurons, which furnish the majority of excitatory inputs onto SOM neurons in the superficial
layers, but not those in deeper layers or white matter, are hypoactive in the illness. Thus, we will test the
hypothesis that SOM neuron abnormalities in SZ are secondary to weaker excitatory drive from layer 3 pyramidal
neurons. We will perform RNAseq on SOM neurons in the superficial gray matter layers and superficial white
matter and measure levels of activity-associated transcripts, predicting lower expression of these transcripts in
SOM neurons from the superficial gray matter (Aim 2). A primate model of the DLPFC microcircuitry will be
employed to provide direct experimental evidence that lower activity of layer 3 pyramidal neurons contributes to
the observed SOM alterations in SZ (Aim 3). The results of these studies will offer insight into the nature of SOM
neuron abnormalities and the basis for these alterations in SZ, guiding future novel therapeutic strategies to
improve SOM neuron function and working memory in the illness."

Fulfilling the promise of modern systems biology and grasping the underlying complexity of biological systems
requires a foundation built upon the development of high-throughput functional genomic approaches capable of
generating large datasets. Large scale sequencing efforts reveal correlations, but lacks causal interactions
best provided via genetic approaches. Caenorhabditis elegans has been a workhorse for gene discovery and
pathway analysis, and is the only established system where high-throughput genetic analysis can be
conducted in the context of a living multi-cellular organism (i.e. feeding based RNAi). Despite the power of this
model system, no high-throughput methods to achieve targeted gene overexpression in C. elegans have been
developed. This project will explore how recombinant strains of two different viruses can be adapted as vectors
to enable large-scale genetic analysis of gene overexpression in C. elegans. The objective of Specific Aim 1 is
to achieve promoter-specific gene activation using CRISPRa. This variant form of CRISPR relies on a
cleavage defective isoform of Cas9 (dCas9) fused with a transcriptional activator to drive overexpression of a
gene targeted by the single gene RNA (sgRNA). Specifically, we propose to generate proof-of-principle
evidence that recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) can deliver a sgRNA into transgenic C. elegans
that express the CRISPRa machinery in intestinal cells to induce sgRNA-directed overexpression of a reporter
gene. Ultimately our goal is to develop a comprehensive sgRNA VSV library directed to promoter regions to
allow high-throughput functional genomic screening in C. elegans. The objective of Specific Aim 2 is to develop
Orsay virus (OV) as a vector to deliver functional mRNA exogenously into C. elegans. The use of OV as a
gene delivery system is straightforward as this virus readily enters the animal via the intestinal lumen, and C.
elegans expressing integrated segments of the OV genome have been validated. Briefly, we will use these
existing strains as “packaging lines” to express C. elegans genes of interest capable of being incorporated in
newly generated virion to infect recipient nematodes. These studies represent an initial step towards the use of
OV as an overexpression vector and would accelerate the development large-scale genetic analysis in this
multicellular organism. These viral-based expression tools would integrate easily with existing approaches
widely used by the C. elegans community, which could potentially transform multiple areas of scientific
investigation, and has implications for understanding of many diseases."
11005576,"The overarching goal of my research program is to identify and characterize molecular mechanisms
responsible for stress-induced permeabilization of the mitochondrial inner membrane. In most eukaryotic
cells, mitochondria are the primary source of the energy that they provide in the form of ATP by
performing oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). OXPHOS is a two-step process. First, substrate
oxidation by the respiratory chain results in the generation of the electrical potential on the mitochondrial
inner membrane. This potential energy drives generation of ATP by the phosphorylation of ADP at the
ATP synthase complex. To prevent energy dissipation and ensure that OXPHOS is efficient mitochondrial
inner membrane permeability should be tightly controlled and maintained at low levels. Stress conditions
associated with dysregulation of calcium and ROS homeostasis can lead to an increase in mitochondrial
inner membrane permeability – a phenomenon known as Mitochondrial Permeability Transition (mPT).
mPT causes dissipation of the membrane potential and loss of mitochondrial ATP-generating capacity
leading to cell dysfunction and death. mPT is critically involved in a broad spectrum of diseases ranging
from heart attack to neurodegeneration. Prevention of mPT is highly protective against cell death and
tissue damage suggesting high therapeutics potential. However, molecular mechanisms of mPT are not
well understood, and this gap in knowledge prevents mPT from being a drug target. Over the past five
years, we demonstrated that mPT is a multifaceted phenomenon and depending on the disease type and
stress severity, it can occur through different pathways. The central goal of our research program is to
identify the link between specific molecular mechanisms of mPT and specific stress conditions. We have
already established several original animal and cell disease-relevant models causing different types of
mPT. In our approach, a variety of methods that measure the mPT and tissue damage at the organismal,
cellular and mitochondrial levels are coupled with a number of our original electrophysiological (patch-
clamp) assays that allow direct measurement of mPT at the level of mitochondrial membranes and give
us a unique opportunity to dissect and characterize its multiple identities and regulation. The results of
our study will provide a detailed understanding of one of the most critical events in cell death cascades
and will bring an essential framework for the development of therapeutically approaches that will
selectively target mPT."

 o This study opened for patient enrollment in December of 2020 and accrual for the last three
 years was significantly slower than the 10 patients per month which was expected. To
 improve accrual the study team amended the trial in April 2023 and made the following
changes:
  The stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) plus hippocampal-avoidant whole brain
 radiotherapy (HA-WBRT) arm was modified to be HA-WBRT alone. The NRG-BN009
 team and the NRG Brain Tumor Committee leadership felt that modifying this arm will
 remove insurance barriers and significantly increase physician and patient
 enthusiasm for the study, and thereby accrual without changing the. fundamental
 scientific question being addressed, which is the comparison of a focal irradiation
 approach (Salvage SRS alone) versus a HA-WBRT approach (extensive field
 irradiation). The primary hypothesis that the latter strategy will improve freedom from
 neurologic death will not be affected by this amendment.
  In addition, the protocol was revised to allow patients to have undergone multiple
 SRS treatments to different brain metastases as long as prior brain metastasis
 velocity (BMV) has been less than 4 brain metastases/year. This change was made
 because presentation with high BMV, and not number of prior SRS treatments, is
 central to the primary hypothesis being tested.
  Lastly, the protocol eligibility was changed to permit enrollment of patients with prior
 small cell cancer, as prior small cell cancer was included in the multiple series that
 demonstrated the importance of BMV.

 o This study was originally projected to complete accrual and testing during 2026. If the

 required sample size. The decision regarding study closure will be made during grant
 year 11.
• Were there any unanticipated issues that negatively impacted conducting the BIQSFP-funded
 assays/tests within projected turn-around time? No If “yes,” please explain.
• Are there any other issues or concerns that should be brought to NCI’s attention? Yes
 o The budget has been modified to reflect the slow accrual to this study and the decreased

11001682,"PROJECT SUMMARY
More than 40% of adults in the United States are obese, and that number is expected to rise to over 50% by
2030. Obesity is a critical health concern as it is associated with several leading causes of death including
diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer. Ingestion of a meal can elicit both positive and negative feelings.
However, the pathways underling these different valences are not well understood, but maladaptive changes
could have broad implications for both overeating and emotional disorders. Drugs that inhibit food intake (FI)
also often lead to aversive side-effects like nausea. Understanding what mediates the positive or negative
feelings associated with satiety is therefore critical to help drive the development of treatments for obesity without
aversive side-effects. Recent work has identified a population of cholecystokinin (CCK) expressing neurons in
the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). Stimulation of these neurons leads to a decrease in FI, but stimulation of
terminals in the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) is rewarding, while stimulation of terminals in the
parabrachial nucleus (PBN) is aversive. However, it remains unclear what drives these divergent projections
physiologically and how terminals activate neurons in the PVH and PBN. To investigate this, I first characterized
what types of vagal afferents innervate NTS-CCK neurons and what currents they express. My results suggest
that there are two subpopulations of neurons: one that is downstream of both CCK and serotonin (5-HT) sensitive
afferents and another that is downstream of only CCK sensitive afferents. Information carried by 5-HT sensitive
afferents is thought to be aversive, while information carried by CCK sensitive afferents is thought to be
rewarding. Thus, I hypothesize that NTS-CCK neurons projecting to the PVH are driven primarily by CCK
sensitive afferents, while PBN projecting neurons receive inputs from both CCK and 5-HT sensitive afferents.
Further, I posit that release of fast transmitters and peptides will have different effects on downstream cells in
the PVH and PBN. These studies will provide valuable information regarding the cellular mechanisms underlying
previously reported behavioral findings. They will also help guide future studies aiming to develop more selective
and less aversive therapies for the treatment and prevention of obesity. To accomplish the proposed experiments
in the F99 phase, I will need to learn stereotaxic injections as well as in-slice photostimulation techniques. My
sponsor, Dr. Suzy Appleyard, and co-sponsor, Dr. Shane Hentges, have expertise in all proposed techniques as
well as established mentoring records. During the K00 phase, I plan to build on the skills learned during the F99
phase by identifying a supportive and knowledgeable postdoctoral mentor. Specifically, I will receive training on
in-vivo opto and chemogenetic stimulation, in-vivo neuronal recording techniques, and computational models for
behavioral analysis. The cellular techniques learned in the F99 phase, combined with the behavioral techniques
learned in the K00 phase will optimally position me to interrogate feeding circuitry from behavior to cellular
mechanisms as an independent investigator."

Sociality involves the ability for animals to live together in cooperative groups, is essential for the survival and
development of many species. However, the neural circuits and mechanisms for directed, context-dependent
pro-social behaviors remain unclear. Here in Aim 1 (the F99 predoctoral phase), I examine how mouse mothers
(‘dams’) can sense sickness in offspring and provide appropriate caregiving to their young. Sickness behaviors
occur in response to inflammation, and include effects such as fatigue, appetite loss, and temperature changes.
These behaviors can serve as socially-useful signals enabling avoidance to limit infection, or approach to solicit
caregiving. Differences in context such as familiarity and social relationship may therefore account for mixed
results regarding conspecific sick avoidance or approach. I use 24/7 longitudinal video monitoring to assess how
maternal behaviors change over the course of sickness induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial
endotoxin commonly used to study sickness behavior. I have found that dams provide caregiving in the form of
increased physical contact toward LPS-injected pups. Dams also exhibit greater approach and time spent near
LPS-injected offspring in a social preference test. Oxytocin is a potent neuromodulator involved in regulating
prosocial behaviors, and is thought to facilitate the salience of social stimuli. It is released throughout the brain
and body via the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus. A major open
question in the field is how distinct parvocellular and magnocellular oxytocin neuron subpopulations contribute
to maternal care, due in part to challenges with targeting these subtypes. The Froemke lab was the first to make
optically-tagged recordings of oxytocin cells in mothers. I propose using these techniques in conjunction with
double transgenic mice developed in our lab to record from oxytocin neuron subtypes in the dam PVN during
interactions with sick vs. healthy pups. In addition to my in vivo recordings using high density silicon probes, I
will test how chemogenetic activation and suppression of these neurons impacts caregiving behavior. I
hypothesize that parvocellular neuron firing in the PVN will facilitate caregiving, and my preliminary recordings
of dam PVN units demonstrate increased responsiveness during interactions with LPS-injected pups. I will further
ask how what sensory signals from sick pups drive PVN activity. Caregiving behavior likely requires multi-sensory
integration given avoidance by dams in the presence of olfactory cues alone from sick offspring. In this way, I
will uncover how sensory signals of perceived sickness in pups promote maternal caregiving behavior via the
oxytocin system. In the K00 postdoctoral phase, I propose a project using similar longitudinal monitoring
techniques as in my predoctoral work to examine how the social environment in fish schooling impacts social
circuitry development and behaviors. This work will complement my current research by providing a neuro-
evolutionary framework to understand mechanisms of sociality across vertebrate species."
10981914,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The proposed research study will test the efficacy of a telehealth version of the Brief Alcohol Screening and
Intervention for College Students (BASICS), which is the gold standard prevention and intervention approach
to target heavy alcohol use on college campuses across the United States. BASICS in an NIAAA Tier 1
intervention which involves assessment of drinking behavior followed by a single in-person session in which
personalized feedback is presented by a trained facilitator in a motivational interviewing (MI) style utilizing harm
reduction principles to reduce risks and alcohol-related consequences. Alternative strategies requiring less
time, effort, and resources, with no face-to-face interaction with a facilitator (e.g., web-based personalized
feedback), have proven less effective. The in-person delivery format of BASICS has presented barriers to
wider implementation due to the time, effort, and costs of traveling to and from sessions, the need for private
meeting space, and the firmly fixed scheduling of intervention sessions. In the proposed study, we will evaluate
the efficacy of a tele-BASICS approach utilizing the ZOOM application compared to in-person BASICS and a
lower threshold treatment as usual intervention. Three hundred mandated and 300 volunteer students who
report hazardous drinking will be recruited from two large universities and randomly assigned to a condition (in-
person BASICS, Tele-BASICS, or treatment as usual). Follow-up assessments will occur 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-
months post-baseline. The significance of this research lies in the potential to maximize access to the highest
standard of care by establishing support for easier access without sacrificing any central features of the
traditional BASICS intervention. In addition, many universities pragmatically adapted existing in-person
interventions to remote-telehealth approaches in response to the COVID pandemic but now have no scientific
basis for determining whether transitioning back to in-person approaches would be beneficial. In addition to
demonstrating non-inferiority to traditional BASICS, we expect Tele-BASICS to significantly outperform
treatment as usual. Attention and working therapeutic alliance are expected to mediate intervention efficacy.
We expect Tele-BASICS to have stronger effects than in-person BASICS among women, heavier drinkers,
students without co-occurring substance use, and those with greater motivation. We expect higher Tele-
BASICS participants recruitment and completion rates and lower costs relative to in-person BASICS. This
research brings together a team of experienced investigators with a collaborative history and supports NIAAA's
strategic plan to improve strategies to prevent and reduce harmful alcohol consumption in a high-risk
population. The establishment of Tele-BASICS as an efficacious alternative to in-person BASICS would allow
more schools to adopt BASICS as their standard of care – and potentially engage more students in empirically-
supported treatment by decreasing barriers to care."
10980990,"ABSTRACT: With only one mechanistically novel antibiotic developed in the past decade with activity versus
resistant Gram-negatives, extensively-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (XDR-PA) continues to pose an
urgent threat to human health in the United States and globally. Phages are an encouraging class of complex
biologics, which have substantial bactericidal activity, high target specificity, favorable toxicity profiles, and an
ability to modulate bacterial virulence. Thus far, phage therapy has been limited to individual patient expanded-
access, investigational new drug applications (eIND) as salvage therapy. Unclear consensus on phage therapy
has led to a heterogeneity in dosing and regimen structures, necessitating additional development. Substantial
innovations are required to quantify the unique aspects of phage pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic (PK/PD)
properties. Target-mediated phage disposition (TMPD) is a special case of target-mediated drug disposition,
which addresses the unique aspects of self-dosing at peripheral sites due to phage binding to target bacteria.
This project proposes optimizing the regimen structure to address the TMPD for five clinically relevant
Pseudomonas phage therapeutics (Luz19, E215, PYO2, PAK_P1, and PaCe) with proven activity against
MDR/XDR P. aeruginosa. Published preclinical and pilot eIND data demonstrate that Pseudomonas phages
Luz19, E215, PYO2, PAK_P1, and PaCe exhibit high therapeutic potential in combination (i.e. an “N-phage
cocktail”). The central hypothesis of this proposal is that optimal N-phage cocktail regimens can be generated
using machine learning-led combination of individual phages based on their chief parameters of infectivity, and
the disposition of each phage in the cocktail can be characterized by a novel, platform physiologically based
pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of target-mediated phage disposition. This project will address the challenges
of phage therapeutics by: developing a translational LC-MS/MS assay for N-phage quantification using in vitro
samples of each phage in antimicrobial growth media then extending the assay for in vivo blood and tissue
matrices (Aim 1). Quantifying the effect of the chief parameters of phage infectivity on bacterial killing and identify
optimal N-phage components and administration patterns using a machine-learning led optimization of PK/PD
(Aim 2). Validating the optimal N-phage cocktail using the HFIM and our leading immunocompromised murine
pneumonia model, while quantifying blood and tissue concentrations of each phage (Aim 3). And tuning and
qualifying a human PBPK model, including descriptions of epithelial lining fluid in the lung and TMPD, based on
whole blood and tissue concentrations of each phage from in vivo murine data (Aim 4). The culmination of these
aims and the main product of this proposal will be the generation of a highly optimized N-phage cocktail and
administration schedule, for use against clinical XDR P. aeruginosa. As a secondary product, we will describe
the phenomenon of TMPD by generating a platform PBPK model for phages that describes whole body
distribution and self-dosing at the infection site, improving the translation of phage-based treatments to humans."

Although preventable, cervical cancer is a leading cause of mortality in low- and middle-income countries
(LMIC). Infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) can lead to cervical precancer (cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or higher, or CIN2+). The World Health Organization (WHO) endorses both
ablation and excision treatment of CIN2+. Excision requires specialized equipment and high-level providers
and is generally not used in LMIC. Thermal ablation (TA) is commonly used to treat CIN2+ in LMIC.
Conventional TA is performed with a non-portable desktop device that requires electricity. The WHO endorsed
TA in 2019 based largely on data from the desktop device, which uses an endocervical probe for every
treatment. Cure rates with the desktop device were 97% after 18 years of follow-up, likely due to using an
endocervical probe being used. Endocervical probes can treat the entire squamocolumnar junction (SCJ),
where cervical cancer arises, versus a flat probe alone. Handheld, inexpensive, portable, battery-operated TA
devices were recently created for use in LMIC. None of the current handheld devices have an endocervical
probe, and cure rates in LMIC are significantly lower at 83%. Liger Medical (Lehi, UT) manufactures a
prototype that is a combination handheld TA device and digital colposcope, the IRISTM, for use in LMIC. The
IRISTM will be modified to include an endocervical probe. In addition, the IRISTM will integrate a machine
learning (ML) algorithm, automated visual evaluation (AVE). When AVE is combined with HPV genotyping,
preliminary data has shown an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.89
with a limited total extreme misclassification rate of 3.4% (CIN2+ as normal or normal as CIN2+).The purpose
of this proposal is to modify the current IRISTM device and clinically validate the changes through the following
aims: Specific Aim 1: To modify the IRISTM prototype device for optimal use in LMIC by a) modifying the existing
probes and b) adapting it to have a machine learning component, automated visual evaluation (AVE); Specific
Aim 2: To clinically validate the IRISTM endocervical probes by estimating the cure rates of CIN2+ one year
after treatment; and Specific Aim 3: To perform a retrospective validation of the AVE algorithm on IRISTM
images utilizing HPV genotyping and histopathologic disease status.
The IRISTM device has the potential to be a global game changer in the field of cervical cancer
prevention. Successful modification of the IRISTM will result in more effective precancer treatment, less
over-treatment, and increased efficiency of screen-and-treat approaches. This project will bring
effective point-of-care triage and treatment to cervical cancer elimination programs in LMIC."

Copper (Cu) has a critical and multifaceted role in the development and function of mammalian brain. Cu
misbalance is observed in many disorders affecting the central nervous system: Menkes disease, Wilson
disease, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, multiple sclerosis, and others. With the exception of Menkes
disease, for most of these disorders the origin of Cu misbalance in the brain is not well understood, and
whether Cu fluxes in and out of the brain are compromised remains unknown. The information about Cu entry
into the healthy brain is also very limited. The proposed program of studies will clarify the mechanism
regulating Cu transfer through choroid plexus (ChPl), an important secretory tissue, which produces
cerebrospinal fluid and forms the brain-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. Studies under Specific Aim 1 will determine
the role of ChPl in Cu entry into the perinatal brain. The abundance, localization, and functional interactions
between the Cu transporters Atp7a, Atp7b, and Slc31a1(Ctr1) as well as endogenous Cu chelators,
metallothioneins, will be characterized at different time points of healthy brain maturation, and these
characteristics will be compared for control and Atp7b-/- mice, an animal model of Wilson disease. Targeted
deletion of Ctr1 and Atp7a in mouse ChPl epithelium will be used to measure contribution of ChPl to Cu
transport into the perinatal brain. Specific Aim 2 will identify the mechanistic link between Cu homeostasis in
ChPl, organization of ChPl cytoskeleton and the development of cilia; this will be achieved using transmission
electron microscopy, immunocytochemistry, and proteomics. The impact of Cu misbalance in Atp7b-/- choroid
plexus on expression and activity of peptidyl-a-amidating mono-oxygenase (PAM), a Cu-dependent enzyme
associated with cilia development will be examined. How changes in Cu homeostasis in ChPl modify the ChPl
secretome will be determined by employing iSLET methodology (in situ Secretory protein Labeling via ER-
anchored TurboID) and mass-spectrometry."
10980632,"Summary
DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) covalently link the two strands of the DNA double helix and are extremely
cytotoxic. Widely used chemotherapeutics (e.g. nitrogen mustards and cisplatin compounds) act by generating
ICLs, but tumors almost invariably become resistant to these agents, often by upregulating repair. ICLs are
also created by endogenous metabolites (e.g. reactive aldehydes, abasic sites), and failure to repair
endogenous ICLs causes human disease. Thus, mutation of 22 different ‘FANC’ genes renders cells sensitive
to ICLs and causes Fanconi anemia (FA), a human disease characterized by bone marrow failure and
predisposition to leukemia and other cancers. ICL repair is coupled to transcription and DNA replication, but
how these processes promote repair is poorly understood. To elucidate mechanisms of ICL repair, we replicate
plasmids containing site-specific ICLs in frog egg extract, which allows us to resolve DNA repair intermediates
at high resolution. We test the hypotheses generated in extracts in mammalian cells. We showed previously
that ICL repair in egg extracts is initiated when replication forks converge on the lesion. Fork convergence
triggers replicative CMG helicase ubiquitylation by the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAIP, which promotes CMG
unloading by the p97 ATPase and initiation of the FA ICL repair pathway. Although TRAIP associates
constitutively with replisomes, it only ubiquitylates CMGs when they have converged at an ICL (“trans”
ubiquitylation); it does not ubiquitylate single CMGs before convergence (“cis” ubiquitylation). This injunction
against cis ubiquitylation is critical to avoid premature replisome disassembly and fork collapse but its
mechanistic basis is unknown. In Aim 1, we test the hypothesis that TRAIP’s interaction with CDC45 at the
replisome constrains TRAIP’s RING domain so that it only ubiquitylates proteins in trans. Once CMG is
unloaded, the FANCI-FANCD2 dimer recruits a complex of the SLX4 scaffold and the XPF-ERCC1 nuclease,
which incises the ICL, but the molecular basis of this recruitment has remained elusive. In Aim 2, we test the
hypothesis that FANCI interacts directly with SLX4 to recruit XPF. We also test the idea that SNM1A makes
the second incision to fully unhook the ICL. ICL repair is also triggered by RNA polymerase II, but the
mechanism is unknown. We have recapitulated transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair in egg extracts.
In Aim 3, we will use this novel, cell-free transcription system to also study the mechanism of transcription-
coupled ICL repair. Many of the hypotheses tested throughout the proposal are based on the in silico protein-
protein interaction screening pipeline we recently established using AlphaFold-Multimer. Our studies will lend
fundamental insights into some of the most pressing questions in ICL repair. As such, our work will help create
a solid foundation for the development of more effective cancer chemotherapies, as well as drugs to mitigate
bone marrow failure and cancer in Fanconi anemia patients."

Latine populations in the U.S. continue to be disproportionately impacted by health disparities, including those
related to chronic and infectious diseases. These disparities are the result of long-standing systemic factors
including social determinants of health and multi-level factors that contribute to increased risk of disease in the
Latine population. Addressing these disparities requires increasing the diversity of researchers by creating
opportunities for rigorous and tailored training in cutting-edge Latine health disparities and health equity
research, including multilevel prevention interventions and related methodologies. This is a new application in
response to the ADVANCE Predoctoral T32 Training Program to Promote Diversity in Health Disparities
Research, Prevention Interventions, and Methodology (RFA-OD-23-018). This application proposes a new T32
doctoral training called ALIADOS (Advanced Training in Latine multi-level Intervention reseArch for DOctoral
Scholars; ‘aliados’ is a Spanish term for ‘allies’). The ALIADOS program will focus on training diverse doctoral
students in Latine health and health disparities and rigorous methods for conducting multilevel-preventive
interventions research. While the T32 focuses on Latine health and health disparities, the skills, and
competencies the T32 scholars will achieve through the program are transferable to diverse contexts and other
populations experiencing health disparities. Thus, the program will have wider reaching benefits to health
disparities research more broadly. The overall program goals are to: 1) Identify, recruit, and retain promising
T32 doctoral scholars, with an emphasis on underrepresented minority students and those committed to working
in Latine health disparities and health equity research, 2) Provide rigorous didactic and hands-on training in
Latine health disparities and health equity research, multi-level prevention interventions and statistical methods
to a diverse cadre of doctoral students in the Joint Doctoral Program in Public Health at SDSU and UCSD through
a comprehensive training program, and 3) Prepare scholars for the successful transition to research
independence and promote next steps in their career development."

 Strong epidemiological evidence demonstrates that chronic psychological stress predicts earlier disease
onset and mortality. The emerging science of stress is increasingly incorporated into the epidemiological study
of healthy aging and there is greater awareness of the role of social stress. NIA has supported the Stress
Measurement Network to elevate stress research through improved measurement, the use of harmonized
stress measures in HRS Around The World (ATW) studies, and utilizing digital platforms to understand
associations between stress and health in daily life. The Stress Network has made tremendous gains—
providing funding for 29 research teams who have contributed to more than 50 publications toward these
goals. Our stress measurement toolbox is widely used, with over 75,000 unique visitors since we launched our
website. We have accelerated stress science by improving the measurement of lifespan stress exposures and
daily responses grounded in a multilevel approach, a widely adopted approach that our network has
advanced.1 However, given the increases in health disparities and rapid social changes such as climate crises,
social polarization, and political instability, we need new and improved measures of macro stressors as well as
validated interventions that can be scaled to reach minoritized populations.
 In our proposed continuation and extension of the network, we build on this foundational work and are
ideally poised to improve and innovate on these products and resources and increase their use. For Aim 1, we
will provide the best practices in psychological and biological stress measurement through (Aim 1a)
implementing webinars, workshops, a podcast (The Stress Puzzle), our expanded online Toolbox of measures
(e.g., existential global stressors, minority stress, cultural measures relevant to stress, resilience, physiological
measures) that may help explain sources of health disparities; use of harmonized stress data in the HRS
studies (Aim 1b), and by building a new toolbox of validated stress-reduction interventions (Aim 1c).
 Secondly, we have added a new goal of advancing innovation and validation of stress-reduction
interventions to promote healthy aging of diverse groups. In Aim 2, we will develop a cohesive and supportive
scientific community through webinars on stress measurement and intervention and will develop a national
Stress Network Collaborative (SNC) that will help shape and participate in Aim 2 interventions, and promote
analyses of pre-existing large-scale stress-reduction interventions to understand race/ethnicity and age effects
(Aim 2a). Using the science of behavior change (SOBC) model, we will support pilot studies that measure and
reduce daily stress and recovery (psychological and physiological responses, which are proposed mechanisms
of accelerated biological aging and early disease) (Aim 2b). Lastly, we will launch a mega-study to compare
stress reduction interventions (Aim 2c). These aims will lead to valuable resources and discoveries that will
help transform the field of stress and contribute to public health."

Reading is a developmental process and a core component of education that depends on the acquisition,
integrity, and processing efficiency of fundamental text-based, linguistic, and neurocognitive processes refined
over time. The recent declines in reading proficiency among fourth and eighth grade students nationwide
underscore the pressing concern related to the developmental challenges posed by adverse childhood
experiences (ACEs) as ACEs are well-recognized ecological determinants of many negative educational and
health outcomes. ACEs are prevalent in over 50% of the United States population and are known to disrupt
crucial neurocognitive processes essential for reading development; however, whether the effect of ACE-
related changes to neurocognitive processes can impact reading outcomes has not been formally studied.
Complicating our collective understanding of these connections is evidence of outcome variability observed
across different reading domains depending on how researchers choose to model ACEs. To bridge these
gaps, data from the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) dataset will be used to
address three research aims: 1) examine the path relationships between four neurocognitive processes
(working memory, inhibition, cognitive flexibility, metacognition) and three benchmarks of reading proficiency
(receptive vocabulary, word identification, and standardized reading assessments) as they pertain to high- and
low-cumulative risk groups, 2) examine variability among pathway relationships between adversity and reading
through neurocognitive processes using different modeling approaches of adversity (i.e., cumulative risk,
threat/deprivation dimensions, latent classes), and 3) develop an integrated reading framework that considers
the developmental sequelae of adversity for future research. Longitudinal, multi-group structural equation
modeling will be used to examine the group-specific relationships between neurocognitive processes, including
a latent factor of metacognition, in middle childhood and reading outcomes measured during early
adolescence. Variability among pathway relationships between groups for each ACE modeling approach, in
addition to comparisons across each approach using global fit indices, will be evaluated to assess how
operationalization of ACEs can differentially influence longitudinal models of reading. This study’s impact lies in
its comprehensive examination of ACEs effects on neurocognitive processes and its subsequent impact on
reading outcomes to develop a conceptual reading framework to inform future work and translational practices."

(e.g. wildfires, flood, hurricanes), air pollution (remote sensing and environment monitoring), physical and
social stress on communities (e.g. built environment), healthcare systems and resources, health services and
outcomes. The DC will work closely with the Admin Core and Community Engagement Core (CEC) to support
all research projects, pilots, and spin-off projects within the CHANGES center. Specifically, the DC will adapt
and deploy state-of-the-art methodologies and models (e.g. multiple-interrupted time series models and
prediction of ambient black carbon due to wildfires) to support the proposed research projects. The DC will
engage the CEC and cater to our community data needs, including providing training and dissemination to
support citizen data science and community resilience. By becoming a data hub for climate-related health
research and community action, the DC will be an essential part of UNM’s infrastructure for climate change
and health in New Mexico and beyond."
10980380,"The neural crest is a uniquely vertebrate cell type that is thought to have played an
important role in vertebrate evolution by forming peripheral ganglia and jaws, thus facilitating
predation and expansion of the brain. In the parent grant, we are testing the hypothesis that
there was progressive expansion of neural crest derivatives during the course of vertebrate
evolution. As case in point, lamprey lack a vagal neural crest that in gnathostomes forms the
enteric nervous system. To further understand the evolution of the enteric nervous system in
basal vertebrates, in this supplement we propose to examine the complexity of the lamprey ENS
in comparison to other vertebrates to gain insight into elaboration of the enteric nervous system
in the vertebrate lineage. To explore this, we propose to transcriptionally profile lamprey ENS
both by single cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics to enable comparison with the ENS of
jawed vertebrates. The results promise to elucidate how new cell types arose during vertebrate
evolution under the umbrella of the neural crest."
10978150,"ABSTRACT
Sensory hypersensitivity and the resulting avoidance behaviors represent a major challenge for most individuals
with Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and for many autistic people. Differences in sensory processing can also
contribute to inattention/distraction, learning disability, repetitive behaviors, and even social avoidance. Indeed,
exaggerated responses to tactile stimuli could also worsen anxiety about social interactions, especially if they
involve physical contact (e.g., shaking hands, hugging, kissing) and if the contact is unwanted. For this proposal
we will explore this relationship between sensory hypersensitivity and social experience in FXS/autism. Social
touch per se has not been investigated in animal models of autism, including FXS; therefore, it is presently
unknown whether they display unique avoidance behaviors or aversive facial expressions to different types of
social touch. It is also not known how such maladaptive behaviors to social touch might be represented in neural
dynamics of relevant brain areas. To address these knowledge gaps, we have developed a novel assay for
social touch in mice. We previously demonstrated that Fmr1-/- mice, the main model of FXS, show avoidance
and defensive behaviors to repetitive whisker stimulation, akin to tactile defensiveness in humans with FXS. In
more recent studies we have shown that Fmr1-/- mice and maternal immune activation (MIA) model mice both
show strikingly similar behavioral phenotypes in response to repeated bouts of social touch, including
hyperarousal, running avoidance, and sustained eye closure. Here, we will follow a symptom-to-circuit strategy
to better understand social touch deficits in FXS/autism. First, we will characterize behavioral responses to social
touch in Fmr1-/- and MIA mice with our novel behavioral assay we have developed. Second, we will `reverse-
engineer' such phenotypes by identifying the underlying circuit and neuronal changes using in vivo
electrophysiological recordings with Neuropixels probes. Finally, we will intervene at the level of neuronal activity
in the relevant circuits (focusing on somatosensory cortex and amygdala) with pharmacology and
chemogenetics, to mitigate deficits in social touch. Our hope is that these preclinical studies will yield significant
insights for the treatment of FXS/autism."
10980382,"PROJECT SUMMARY (OVERALL)
The University of Southern California (USC) CLIMAte-Related Exposures, Adaptation, and Health Equity
(CLIMA) Center's mission is to build a community of transdisciplinary scientists and robust research
infrastructure to advance its theme of community-engaged, solution-oriented climate change (CC), adaptation,
and health research. The goal is to inform climate action policies for health equity that strengthen local adaptive
capacity, reduce vulnerability, and increase resilience across the life course. A Methods Development Research
Core (MDRC) will develop innovative, highly spatiotemporally resolved models of exposure to urban heat islands,
wildfire smoke, and increasingly frequent, concurrently, or consecutively occurring compound climate events and
investigate their overlap with neighborhood adaptation strategies (e.g., air conditioning use, tree canopy shade,
greening interventions) and vulnerabilities (power outages) to identify priorities for increasing CC resilience.
These exposure and adaptation measures will be linked to large and diverse electronic medical record (EMR)
Data Lakes from USC-affiliated hospital systems, with novel geo-enrichment with neighborhood social and
environmental determinants of health in Research Project 1 (RP1), and with lifetime residential histories of young
adults with detailed cardiovascular health assessment starting from childhood in Research Project 2 (RP2). RP1
will assess heat extremes and wildfire influenced particulate matter air pollution impact on acute heart failure
hospitalization and rehospitalization risk in adults, while informing new directions in biostatistical methods. RP2
will assess the lifetime heat stress and wildfire smoke exposures impact on cardiovascular health measures
(blood pressure, pulse rate) and allostatic load as a measure of biological resilience, and as a cardiovascular
risk indicator earlier in life. The two RP's will investigate how these effects differ by social vulnerability and
adaptation factors (e.g., air conditioning use, power outages, power grid resilience, urban heat islands, tree
canopies etc.). The Community Engagement Core (CEC) will facilitate solution-oriented translational research
and multi-directional communication with policymakers and the public. It will engage environmental justice
communities using an intergenerational approach, including community participatory action research and
education to engage youth in the co-design, monitoring, and ground-truthing of adaptation strategies. The CLIMA
Center will create strong transdisciplinary research teams, capacity, and culture urgently needed to assess the
complex, cascading impacts of CC hazards and exposures on health equity and adaptive capacity over the life
course, starting with cardiovascular health and disease as a sentinel public health burden. Given California's
diverse communities and array of climate adaptation, mitigation, and health equity policies, it provides an
opportunity to interrogate real-life effectiveness, co-benefits, and gaps of policies already in place; inform policies
nationwide; and use CLIMA results to inform how to protect the most vulnerable and strengthen CC resiliency."
10976472,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Excessive endothelial inflammation, ‘endotheliitis,’ is a hallmark pathologic feature of severe SARs-CoV2
infection. The sequalae of endotheliitis, such as microthrombosis and tissue hyperpermeability, culminate in a
maladaptive host response characterized by interstitial edema, tissue damage, and end organ dysfunction.
Despite advances in vaccines and antiviral treatments, the most severely ill patients suffering from SARs-CoV2
related endotheliitis have an elevated risk of mortality. There are currently neither specific medications
available to treat nor to prevent endotheliitis. Current therapies for severe SARs-CoV-2 infection are limited to
non-specific steroids, immunomodulators and anticoagulants: all are limited in clinical use due to significant
risk profile from off-target effects. Thus, a critical need exists for understanding specific regulators of the
dysfunctional endothelial response for development of targeted therapies. Utilizing human SARs-CoV2
specimens and multiple murine coronavirus models, we identify a novel role for histone methyltransferase
MLL1 in regulating gene expression central to the endotheliitis response: cellular adhesion molecules (CAMs)
and pro-coagulant mediators (PCMs). Through a series of experiments, we have identified specific signal
transducer and activators of transcription (STATs) as important drivers of viral-induced MLL1 expression and
IL-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs) as key regulators of MLL1 degradation. Hence, we identified that the
imbalance of STAT-mediated expression and IRAK-mediated degradation of MLL1 augments viral
endotheliitis. These results have led to our hypothesis that endotheliitis gene expression in response to
coronavirus is mechanistically driven by the STAT-MLL1-IRAK pathway and promotes overt endothelial
activation, microthrombosis, and end-organ damage. We further postulate that endothelial homeostasis may
be restored via nanoparticle encapsulated MLL1 inhibitor targeted to the endothelial cells, resulting in
attenuation of viral-induced endotheliitis. This hypothesis will be investigated via the following specific aims:
Aim 1: To determine the mechanism(s) by which MLL1 targets endothelial CAMs and PCMs promotor
regions. Aim 2: To determine the role of STAT-1/3 in endothelial MLL1 induction and IRAK4 in MLL1
degradation. Aim 3: To determine functional impact of endothelial specific MLL1 inhibition on EC
adhesive characteristics and thrombotic propensity in vivo. Completion of these aims will increase our
mechanistic understanding of endothelial MLL1 as master regulator of endotheliitis-related genes in an
infectious context. The results from this proposal will define for the first time the ability of an endothelial-
targeted therapy to inhibit the pathologic features of severe SARs-COV2 infection."
10976473,"Recent and seismic policy shifts in the Midwest of the United States have abruptly restricted access to abortion
and other pregnancy-related care for millions of people. Following the June 2022 Supreme Court opinion in the
Dobbs vs Jackson Women’s Health Organization case, Midwestern states immediately reinstated 150+ year
old abortion bans, legislated the first new abortion ban in the country, and saw widespread clinic closures. To
understand the barriers faced by pregnant people seeking abortion in the Midwest amidst these rapidly
changing political shocks and to quantify the impact of these restrictions on their health and lives, unbiased,
locally relevant data are urgently needed. Yet, most abortion access research has recruited participants from
clinics—participants who, by virtue of having gotten to an abortion clinic, represent a population that was able
to overcome many barriers to care, and further, excludes people who use telemedicine or self-manage their
abortions, and those who continue their pregnancies. A clinic-based sampling mechanism thus induces
selection bias, resulting in research that misses or underestimates barriers to care. To address these
methodological limitations, prospective research is needed that (1) expands recruitment to the full population of
people seeking abortion, not just those who make it to a clinic, (2) sensitively measures barriers and facilitators
to abortion care, (3) captures the full set of possible pregnancy pathways (including miscarriage, birth, clinical
abortion, telemedicine abortion, self-managed abortion) and their sequelae over time, and (4) is sufficiently
powered to answer nuanced questions at the regional level. To address this time-sensitive need in an
underserved region, we propose four linked aims in a two-phase study. In the first six months of the R61, we
will recruit 500 pregnant people searching for information about abortion online to identify (via surveys; Aim 1)
and characterize (via 30 in-depth interviews; Aim 2) the barriers people face while seeking abortion in all 12
Midwest states. In the second (R33) phase of the study, we will follow these participants forward in time with
additional surveys at 4, 10, and 18 months to measure who succeeds in obtaining abortion and who does not,
and the implications of their pregnancy outcome on broader physical, mental, and socioeconomic health
across restrictive versus permissive states (Aim 3). Finally, we will implement a human-centered design
approach to engage abortion fund leaders and Midwesterners who have sought abortions to develop and test
messages to address knowledge barriers or belief gaps identified in the R61 phase that limit access to abortion
(Aim 4). This will result in a health communication intervention that we will launch in the Midwest. At the study’s
completion, our expected outcomes are to have demonstrated the value of online recruitment for abortion
research, identified locally specific barriers to abortion care in the Midwest, and engaged stakeholders to
develop and launch a health communication intervention to facilitate abortion access. Findings from this study
will drive more informed, geography-specific interventions to address urgent access challenges in the Midwest."

In the adrenal, aldosterone is produced in the zona glomerulosa (ZG), cortisol in the zona fasciculata (ZF) and adrenal androgens, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and DHEA sulfate (DHEAS), in the zona reticularis (ZR). The cortical zones are thought to be maintained by centripetal ‘streaming’ of the outer proliferative subcapsular progenitor ZG cells to aldosterone-producing ZG cells to glucocorticoid-producing ZF cells, and in humans to androgen-producing ZR cells. This proposal focuses on defining the least understood processes within adrenal zonation. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that angiotensin II (AngII) regulates mouse adrenal progenitor cell differentiation to aldosterone-producing ZG cells. Rationale: The ZG houses (i) an undifferentiated progenitor pool under the control of Wnt signaling that exclusively expresses Sonic hedgehog (SHH), and (ii) an organized group of cells that produce aldosterone under the control of AngII that exclusively expresses aldosterone synthase (AS). The mechanisms whereby progenitor cells (SHH+/AS-) give rise to differentiated ZG cells (SHH-/AS+) is unknown. We will determine 1) if AngII mediates the homeostatic lineage conversion of SHH+/AS- progenitor cells into differentiated SHH-/AS+ aldosterone-producing cells of the ZG; and 2) if AngII does so by reorganization of the chromatin landscape in the progenitor cells. Approach: We will use lineage tracing transgenic mouse models and techniques that include single cell multi-omics (RNAseq+ATACseq) and cut-and-tag sequencing to dissect these processes. Specific Aim 2 will define the mechanisms controlling conversion of human ZF cells to DHEAS-producing ZR cells. Rationale: The molecular mechanisms controlling ZR production of DHEAS are unknown. The ZF expression of the steroidogenic enzyme HSD3B2 allows for the production of cortisol. However, the complete lack of HSD3B2 in the ZR and the presence of the enzyme SULT2A1 is a critical factor for the ZR-specific synthesis of DHEAS. We will test the function of two previously unstudied adrenal nuclear receptor signaling pathways and probe the hypotheses that (i) ZR activation of the transcriptional repressor Rev-ERB blocks HSD3B2 transcription in the ZR cells, which facilitates DHEAS biosynthesis; and (ii) ZR activation of vitamin D3 receptor by locally produced ligands activates SULT2A1 transcription, which is instrumental for DHEAS production. Approach: Mice do not have a functional ZR, do not produce DHEAS and, therefore, cannot be used to study adrenal DHEAS production. We will use human adrenal tissue and cells in combination with single cell multi-omics, spatial transcriptomics and in situ high-resolution mass spectrometry imaging to define the role of the Rev-ERB and vitamin D3 nuclear hormone receptors in the transcriptional programming leading to conversion of a ZF to ZR DHEAS-producing phenotype. Significance and Impact: The proposed studies will collectively provide the mechanisms controlling adrenal progenitor cell homeostasis as well as the molecular mechanism leading to adrenal androgen production. These findings have the potential of improving our understanding of normal adrenal homeostasis as well as diseases of adrenal steroid deficiency and excess."
10976598,"Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic, autoimmune connective tissue disease affecting multiple
organ systems, marked by arthritis, dermatitis, nephritis (LN) as well as neurological involvement. The
prevalence of LN varies depending on age, sex, and ethnicity, and is estimated to be 40–70%. Despite
advancements in the understanding of the pathophysiology of end-organ involvement in lupus, and novel
therapeutics, only 50–70% of patients achieve remission. There is clearly a need for identifying easily
 measurable biomarkers for diagnosing and monitoring this autoimmune disease, predicting response to therapy
 and prognosticating long term outcome in lupus. Our project focuses on identifying proteins in body fluids that
 may help identify and subset lupus more effectively. In the past cycle of funding, we have reported serum
 biomarkers for systemic disease in lupus, cerebrospinal fluid proteins for neuropsychiatric lupus, as well as
 excreted proteins for renal disease, using a variety of different proteomic approaches. In this renewal proposal,
 we will focus on ten proteins that have been independently validated across multiple patient cohorts, using
orthogonal approaches, as being highly reflective of disease activity in lupus. Together, these 10 proteins
 constitute LN-10-plex. We will perform extended clinical validation of the LN-10-plex proteins in larger patient
 cohorts of different ethnic origins to confirm their association and correlation with clinical disease activity, using
 training and validation cohorts. Using longitudinal cohorts, we will examine if the LN-10-plex proteins at baseline
can be used to predict oncoming disease flares. In lupus patients undergoing induction therapy, we will
 ascertain if baseline levels of LN-10-plex proteins can predict response to therapy. We will also assess if easily
 measurable biomarkers can be used to track tissue pathology, as this will avoid the need for repeat biopsies.
 Thus, the broad, over-arching goal of our research is to be able to identify easily measurable biomarkers of
 disease in lupus, and harness them for improved clinical utility."
11176539,"Dynamic and correct protein synthesis by the ribosome is essential to cell’s normal function, especially in muscle
and neuron cells. The intricate ribosome internal structure and elongation factors achieve fast and faithful peptide
elongation cycles at the expenses of GTP energy. However, mechanism and cellular level regulations of this
process in healthy and diseased cells are still not clear. For example, elongation errors due to amino acid
misincorporation and frameshifting are the fundamental causes for neuron degenerative diseases,
cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and viral infections. Regulation of the human ribosome translocase eEF2 via
phosphorylation is the only known normal functional modification, making the eEF2 kinase an extremely popular
drug target. However, how this modification affects the translocation is unclear. Similarly, mutations in eEF1, the
other elongation factor, causes congenital epilepsy and intellectual disability with unclear mechanism. In addition,
dynamic RNA modifications are connected with translation regulation and antibiotic resistance. We will tackle
these problems with super-resolution force spectroscopy (SURFS) that can directly measure the ribosome
toeprinting on the mRNA at both sides flanking the ribosome, and reveal the mechanical force’s role in this
movement. The outcome of this proposal is to prove the hypothesis of ribosome’s “inchworm-like” translocation
model that was proposed during the first supporting period. It will fill the current knowledge gap regarding
mechanical force’s role in translocation fidelity, reveal new therapeutic targets for related diseases, and generate
a new tool for biophysical research. Our research is unique because force in ribosome translation is only recently
confirmed and its mechanistic role is largely unknown. To our best knowledge, FIRMS and SURFS are the only
approaches that can probe both force and movement of ribosome. The aims are: 1) reveal the relationship
among power stroke, frameshifting, and kinetics using disease-causing mutations in elongation factors. EF-G
and EF-Tu’s mutations at the GTP binding pocket and EF-G’s domain IV loops interacting with tRNA are the
subjects. 2) investigate the roles of mRNA modifications, codon repeats, and antibiotics in translocation. Among
the 27 mRNA residues covered inside the ribosome, specific locations interact with the rRNAs to serve as the
brakes for reading frame maintenance. Modifications and antibiotic bindings at these locations are the focus in
this aim. In addition, how G-quadruplexes of repeating mRNA sequences induce frameshifting and alter the
kinetics will be revealed. 3) develop multiplex time-resolved SURFS. During the previous funding period, we
developed force-induced remnant magnetization spectroscopy (FIRMS) to resolve different reading frames and
determine the power strokes of EF-G and its modifications. Toward the end of the first funding period, SURFS
technique was developed that integrated acoustic radiation force with FIRMS to achieve five-fold better force
resolution. In this aim, SURFS will enable automatic multiplexed measurement with time-resolution. Therefore,
we will advance this technique with more efficient and precise measurements for force and translocation steps."

Chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI, chemobrain), chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy
(CIPN) and gait changes are debilitating side-effects of cancer treatment with platinum agents (e.g., cisplatin),
taxanes, and vinca alkaloids. Cisplatin is widely used as a chemotherapeutic agent to treat ovarian malignancies.
Over 70% of women report experiencing CRCI, CIPN and/or falls during treatment or after completion, impairing
their quality of life. These neurotoxic impairments can also compromise treatment with cisplatin, influencing
disease progression. Currently, there are no FDA-approved clinical interventions for the treatment of CRCI and
CIPN. Mechanistically, cisplatin-induced neuronal toxicity derives from nuclear and mitochondrial DNA damage,
and oxidative stress, which induce the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), p38MAPK
and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), leading to neuronal apoptosis. Our preliminary data show that in vitro
pharmacological inhibition with small molecule inhibitors, i.e., neflamapimod for p38MAPK and SP600125 for
JNK, prevents cisplatin-induced reduction in dendritic spine branching and density. Based on these data, we
hypothesize that inhibition of the p38MAPK/JNK pathways will prevent cisplatin-induced neuronal
apoptosis and damage, leading to attenuation of cognitive impairments, gait changes, and neuropathic
pain associated with CRCI and CIPN. In this project, we propose to determine if: (1) cisplatin-induced p38
MAPK/JNK signaling underlies structural and functional neuronal damage, using in vitro pharmacological
inhibition and siRNA silencing; (2) neflamapimod and SP600125 prevent cisplatin-induced neuropathy and gait
alterations in the ID8 syngeneic epithelial ovarian cancer in C57BL/6 mice and the transgenic breast cancer
model C3TAg in FVBN mice; and (3) cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity is attenuated by p38MAPK/JNK inhibition
without compromising its anti-cancer activity. Our Approach includes in vitro analysis of 2 separate neuronal cell
lines, behavioral analysis using sensory testing for CIPN, testing of cognitive impairment, and novel
MouseWalker for gait changes in female mice using the two mouse cancer models. The proposed studies will
demonstrate the role of the p38MAPK and JNK in cisplatin induced CRCI/CIPN, and translational potential for
novel strategies to treat CRCI and CIPN. Due to health disparities, women suffer more disproportionately from
cancer and pain-related treatment than men. Therefore, testing our hypothesis in female mice is expected to
significantly advance the understanding and treatment of cisplatin-induced neurotoxic side effects and improve
the quality of life for women with cancer. Nevertheless, we expect that these findings may also apply to cisplatin-
induced neurotoxicity in males and to other cancers than ovarian and breast cancers."
10988924,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Biomarkers that reliably inform the selection of therapy or prognosis for patients with head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are lacking. This can result in the use of overly aggressive or ineffective therapy with
the associated negative impact on quality of life and mortality. Thus, there is a great need for the development
of non-invasive biomarkers that accurately predict response to therapy or prognosis of HNSCC. Emerging data
suggest that analysis of the cargos of small (30-150 nm) extracellular vesicles (sEV), also known as exosomes,
in body fluids is a promising approach to the detection of non-invasive biomarkers in cancer, including HNSCC.
In cancer patients, plasma sEV are mixtures of tumor-derived exosomes (TEX) and vesicles produced by non-
malignant cells (NTEX) such as leukocytes. We found that TEX are a prominent but variable subset of sEV in
HNSCC patients’ plasma. TEX recapitulate the content of tumor cells, while the molecular cargo of NTEX
resembles that of non-malignant leukocytes, largely T cells, reprogrammed by TEX. Our data indicate that both
these sEV subsets mediate immune suppression and influence responses to therapy. We hypothesize that in
HNSCC patients, TEX as well as NTEX mediate immune suppression and are responsible for poor prognosis
and resistance to anti-cancer therapies. Using a novel immune capture-based technology, we will separate TEX
from NTEX in HNSCC patients’ plasma and will then simultaneously evaluate these two sEV subsets as potential
biomarkers. In Aim 1, we will establish efficacy of the immune capture strategy for TEX and NTEX isolation from
HNSCC patients’ plasma and determine the potential of these sEV subsets to serve as biomarkers of cancer
and immune competence, respectively. Levels as well as phenotypic profiles and immunosuppressive functions
of the two sEV subsets will be evaluated and assessed for their ability to discriminate HNSCC patients from
healthy donors (HDs). In addition, high-resolution (HR) LC-MS/MS will be used to identify proteins in TEX and
NTEX that could be utilized as prognostic or predictive biomarkers. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the utility of TEX
and NTEX as biomarkers of prognosis in patients with locally advanced HNSCC treated with standard of care
therapy (N=200). Utilizing TEX and NTEX isolated from well-annotated existing pre-treatment plasma samples,
nanoflow cytometry, functional assays, and targeted HR LC-MS/MS will be used to assess phenotypic profiles
and immunosuppressive functions. We will correlate TEX and NTEX plasma levels and profiles with clinical
endpoints. In Aim 3, we will investigate the utility of TEX and NTEX as biomarkers of response to anti-PD-1 mAb
immunotherapy in HNSCC patients diagnosed with recurrent/metastatic disease (N=80). TEX and NTEX
characteristics will be assessed as in Aim 2, and we will evaluate whether they are predictive of the efficacy of
anti-PD-1 mAb therapy. The simultaneous assessment of TEX and NTEX in plasma of HNSCC patients will
confirm the role of these two sEV subsets as biomarkers of cancer as well as of cancer-induced defects in
immune competence. Importantly, these biomarkers, alone or together, have the potential to guide selections of
therapies that will improve outcome and reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with HNSCC."

Our vision is to develop, apply, and advance new technologies in the broad thematic program of the manipulation
of nucleic acids. The research largely focuses on RNA-based applications, which is both driven and enhanced
by our unique environment at The RNA Institute, enabling easy collaboration and cross pollination of ideas and
techniques across fields. The importance of RNA and RNA technologies has never been clearer, with a pandemic
RNA virus (SARS-CoV-2) being managed by RNA biosensing tools and mRNA-based vaccines. It is now well
accepted that RNA plays a complex role in biology that goes far beyond the “central dogma”. Elucidating many
RNA functions and biomedical applications requires investment in technology development. In this proposal,
carried out over the next five years, we aim to advance technology in three main areas: 1) DNA nanoswitches
as programmable nanoscale reagents for reporting molecular interactions, 2) the Centrifuge Force Microscope
(CFM) for high throughput single molecule probing and analysis, and 3) DNA nanotechnology for applications in
drug delivery and sensing. Each of these areas builds on our strengths and past performance.
In the first area, we use DNA nanoswitches as “smart” reagents that change conformation upon binding a target
molecule. Building on past success, we will expand this innovative method to enable low cost and simple RNA
detection, quantification, and purification for various RNAs. These include detection of RNA modifications,
detection of regulatory lncRNAs, and purification of RNA and RNA complexes. In the second area, we will
develop and execute assays for the Centrifuge Force Microscope (CFM) in RNA and DNA interaction analysis
and RNA structure-function probing. In particular, we will investigate fundamental thermodynamics of weak
interactions in DNA and RNA, develop a new method for single-molecule structural probing of RNA, and study
the structure-function relationship of a pre-clinical therapeutic ribozyme. In the third area, relatively new for our
lab, we expand work to analyze and develop DNA nanotechnology for applications including drug delivery.
Specifically, we are interested in understanding and “programming” biostability into DNA nanostructures, and in
coordinating chemical attachment and triggered release of molecular payloads from DNA nanostructures.
This proposal aims to carry out ambitious research and development plans performed within the context of
several biomedical projects. The impact of the developments will extend beyond the individual projects, as our
core technologies and methods are increasingly adopted by other groups. In the first MIRA term we have proven
our ability to develop impactful technology and advance innovative science on several fronts. In this second term,
we aim show sustainability of our research endeavors, solidifying our niches, maintaining high productivity, and
ultimately producing knowledge and tools to benefit the scientific community."

 Hemorrhagic shock is the leading cause of early mortality in people aged 1-44 years old, following a
traumatic injury. A significant proportion of these early fatalities are associated with non-compressible truncal
hemorrhage (NCTH). Endovascular approaches such as Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the
Aorta (REBOA) and Partial Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta (pREBOA) have
evolved as an effective way to manage NCTH. However, the optimal implementation (i.e., occlusion size,
timing, and duration of device deployment) remains largely unknown since hemostatic control must be
maintained. Additionally, little is known about how the use of an endovascular hemorrhage control device alters
other aspects of resuscitation and critical care management, such as total pressor and fluid requirements.
 To address this knowledge gap, this diversity supplement project seeks to: (1) examine the impact of
partial and complete aortic occlusion on the effectiveness of resuscitation as measured by the total pressor
and crystalloid fluid requirements and (2) exploit machine learning approaches to identify early hemodynamic
patterns that are associated with hypoperfusion and inadequate resuscitation. Dr. Gomez has proposed a
detailed mentoring and training plan that will provide a strong foundation in research development and
grantsmanship, translational science, and quantitative analysis/modelling through formal didactic training,
workshops, conferences, research seminars beyond the experiences gathered through the conduct of
proposed research aims in this supplement and the parent grant. The environment at Wake Forest University
School of Medicine is excellent for this research with access to resources through the PI’s lab, the Center for
Translational Science Institute and Center for Artificial Intelligence that will provide supplementary professional
training in translational research and machine learning.
 The long-term goal of this project is to identify key hemodynamic and temporal patterns that are
associated with inadequate resuscitation and hypoperfusion such that improved resuscitation and vasopressor
management can be delivered to critically injured patients. Understanding how endovascular devices such as
REBOA and pREBOA alter vascular response and resuscitation across different hemorrhage levels will allow
us to better understand how to implement these devices into patient care, including the refinement of
automated critical care platforms. This proposed project will certainly aid in propelling Dr. Gomez’s carer in
academic medicine and translational science."
11001789,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Leukodystrophies are genetic neurodegenerative diseases that affect the white matter within the central nervous
system (CNS) and commonly manifest during childhood. They have a range of cellular etiologies, with some resulting
from astrocytic dysfunction; two of these include Vanishing White Matter Disease (VWM) and Alexander’s Disease
(AxD). While both diseases lead to demyelination, motor abnormalities, intellectual disability, seizures, and pre-
mature death, AxD can be inherited or sporadic, and is caused by autosomal dominant, toxic gain-of-function
mutations in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). VWM, however, is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the
subunits [1-5] of eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B), most commonly in EIF2B5. Both have no treatments.
Due to VWM’s monogenic and recessive nature, it is a good candidate for adeno-associated virus (AAV)-
mediated gene supplementation therapy. Therefore, my dissertation has focused on characterizing and
treating the severe Eif2b5I98M murine model with an astrocyte-targeted AAV9-EIF2B5 gene therapy. We
designed constructs to drive astrocyte-specific or ubiquitous therapeutic EIF2B5 transgene expression. Ongoing
efficacy studies indicate that these vectors partially rescue body weight and motor function, and significantly
extend survival of Eif2b5I98M mice; however, these animals are now experiencing severe and life-limiting
seizures. Preliminary data in treated VWM mice shows we were able to restore EIF2B5 expression, however
analysis of the integrated stress response (ISR)—a pathway that is mediated by eIF2B and rescues
homeostasis after cell stress—remained dysregulated. Therefore, we hypothesize that uncorrected molecular
pathways (ISR) in primary and secondary cell types are leading to incomplete rescue. We propose that
synergistic combination utilizing the clinically relevant ISR modulator, Integrated Stress Response Inhibitor
(ISRIB), and our gene therapy will provide a targeted and more comprehensive correction of disease. ISRIB
has been shown to lessen VWM pathologies by stabilizing the mutated eIF2B complex and is now in a clinical
trial for VWM [NCT05757141]. Herein, in the F99 phase (Aim 1), I propose to learn and utilize cutting edge
approaches including state-of-the-art sequencing and multiomic analyses to elucidate the molecular profile of
incomplete treatment, to then provide a more durable, comprehensive, and targeted therapeutic approach for
VWM. To continue my academic career and to strengthen my training in neuroscience-focused gene therapy,
in the K00 phase (Aim 2) I propose to diversify my scientific repertoire with novel therapeutic approaches that
are applicable to more complex white matter disorders—such as toxic gain-of-function, AxD—as well as
advance my training in in vitro and in vivo model characterization and pre-clinical efficacy testing through the
implementation and testing of AAV-mediated astrocyte-targeted gene knockdown of toxic GFAP. The goal is to
provide a durable, safe, and efficacious treatment for AxD."

Cervical cancer is preventable, yet it remains one of the most common causes of cancer-related death in
women in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Few diseases reflect global inequities as much as
cervical cancer. as incidence and mortality rates are 2-3 times higher in LMICs compared to richer countries.
Further, women living with HIV (WLH) are six times more likely to develop cervical cancer compared to women
who are HIV-negative. Reaching WLH, who are at high risk of developing cervical cancer, requires integration
of preventive screening and treatment services for both diseases (cervical cancer and HIV) to increase
efficiencies and maximize impact. For more than two decades, researchers have investigated alternative
approaches to cervical cancer screening to maximize their impact in LMICs, culminating in strong endorsement
of human papilloma virus (HPV) testing for primary screening in the current World Health Organization (WHO)
guidelines. Importantly, for WLH, among whom HPV co-infection is exceptionally high, approaches known as
“Screen, Triage, and Treat” (iSTAR) have been demonstrated to be safe and effective. The Screen, Triage,
and Treat approach is designed for implementation in a single visit to reduce attrition and to use health care
personnel expertise optimally for maximal efficiency. In response to RFA-CA-23-033, our study seeks to
identify, understand, and develop strategies to address barriers to the adoption, integration, and sustainability
of evidence-based cancer control interventions among persons with HIV in LMICs. To that end, we propose to
use a bundle of strategies (mHealth clinical decision support tool, practice facilitation, and patient education
material) to implement the WHO-endorsed iSTAR approach for cervical cancer screening for WLH in La
Romana, Dominican Republic (DR). The existing cervical cancer screening programs in the DR are inefficient
and ineffective, resulting in one of the highest disease burdens in the world. In response to this need, the
clinical team at Clínica de Familia approached experts in cervical cancer control, HIV, informatics, and
implementation science at Columbia University to assemble a multidisciplinary team to overcome the current
challenges in providing cervical cancer screening for the women attending their clinic. The overall goal of this
project is to sustain implementation of the evidence-based iSTAR approach for cervical cancer screening in
WLH and to generate new data to inform effective and equitable implementation on a wider scale."

For >18 years, Makerere and Johns Hopkins universities have partnered in Uganda to characterize the
epidemiology of hepatitis B (HBV) and HIV co-infection, define the subsequent sequelae including hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) and advance clinical management. Through an NCI-supported U54 program, we conducted
one of the largest and well-characterized studies of HCC in Africa, recruiting from both central urban and northern
rural regions of Uganda. Moreover, we have performed mixed-methods research to identify knowledge and
clinical barriers to implementation of HBV screening and diagnosis within HIV care settings. Recently, our
collaborative team successfully completed a demonstration project focused on integrating HBV diagnostic and
treatment services into HIV care in the West Nile region and also launched an implementation assessment of
antenatal care screening for and delivery of HepB birth dose vaccination at multiple sites across Uganda.
Importantly, the burden and lethality of HCC can be successfully ameliorated with implementation of evidence-
based and contextually appropriate prevention, screening, diagnostic and treatment interventions. However,
these measures have not been comprehensively implemented into routine care settings in Uganda or other high
HCC burden regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Leveraging this long-standing work in Uganda, our proposed bundle
of interventions, the Liver Cancer Comprehensive Control (LC3) package, incorporates diagnostic testing and
treatment of HBV, primary prevention through vaccination of susceptible adults, and referral for liver disease
staging and active surveillance for early HCC detection among at-risk populations. We will integrate the LC3
package into existing HIV care delivery platforms among adults living with HIV in Uganda. Our overarching goal
is to demonstrate the reach, effectiveness, and maintenance of delivering LC3 services within HIV care settings.
Successful implementation of LC3 in Uganda will serve as a model for integrating complex cancer control
intervention packages into existing HIV care delivery systems across similar countries in sub-Saharan Africa."

 Research is an essential element any medical professional’s training and professional development.
However, many medical students have limited opportunities to participate in laboratory, clinical or translational
research during their training. As a consequence, the number of physicians that can be recruited into research
careers is modest. The Medical Student Summer Research Program (MSSRP) allows medical students from
any US medical school to experience research firsthand by spending 9-10 weeks conducting research and
analyzing data in the clinical, outcomes, and basic science research laboratories of established faculty
investigators at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine (UCCOM) and the Cincinnati Children’s
Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC). The goal of the MSSRP and this Short-Term Medical Student Training
Grant (T35 DK060444) is to provide medical students with short-term opportunities to participate in research
projects that align with the NIDDK mission.
 To achieve this goal, we provide high quality, structured interactions with UCCOM / CCHMC faculty
through focused research projects and outstanding mentorship. Since NIDDK support of the MSSRP began in
2001, T35 DK 060444 has supported 299 medical students and been cited in 163 publications. The number of
UCCOM faculty with NIDDK-focused research programs has expanded considerably in recent years with a
significant increase in NIDDK funding from $16.6 million in 2013 to $36.0 million in 2023. A partial list of
research areas includes 1) gut microbiome and mucosal immunology, 2) inflammatory diseases of the liver and
viral hepatitis, 3) liver development and hepatocellular carcinoma, 4) allergic and immune responses, 5)
urologic and hematologic disorders, 6) organoid biology, 7) enterocyte biology, mucosal inflammation, and
inflammatory bowel disease, 8) non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, 9) intestinal transport/absorption, 10) obesity
and diabetes, 11) renal injury and rejection, renal carcinoma, chronic kidney disease, and 12) nutritional
aspects of health and disease.
 The UCCOM has an outstanding track record in the development and recruitment of under-represented
minority (URM) medical students, both locally and nationally. Since 2019, newly admitted classes have
consisted of 51% women and 19% URM. Through its Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, UCCOM has
several recruitment and retention efforts specific to under-represented students and those from disadvantaged
backgrounds. Faculty demographics for the UCCOM (excluding Pediatrics) includes 1483 faculty of whom
41% are women, 69% white, 4% African American, 22% Asian, and 3% Hispanic. In June 2023, UCCOM
counted 141 individuals across 26 distinct departments and divisions. These data attest to the large number of
URM students and faculty that can participate in the MSSRP and support our goal of having 20% of our 12
requested positions filled by URM/diverse students."
11001755,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Understanding the mechanisms that underlie learning and memory formation has been a goal of modern
neuroscience. Moreover, investigating these processes is of critical importance to determine how they go awry
in neurological disorders. Arc is an immediate early gene (IEG) that is dynamically expressed in response to
learning and genetic ablation of this gene in rodents leads to severe long-term memory deficits. Recently, the
Shepherd lab discovered that Arc evolved from an ancient Ty3 retrotransposon and has maintained its virus-like
properties. In particular, Arc protein is capable of self-assembling into virus-like capsids that can encapsidate
genetic material. These capsids can be transferred between neurons in extracellular vesicles (EVs) and deliver
nucleic acids in the process, similar to retroviruses. However, the function of Arc mediated intercellular
communication and the role of virus-like capsids in memory formation is entirely unknown. My current work has
demonstrated that 1) Arc capsids are assembled and released from neurons during long-term potentiation (LTP)
through direct interaction with I-BAR protein IRSp53. 2) EV transferred Arc reduces surface AMPA receptor levels
via translation of delivered Arc mRNAs. Together, these results suggest that Arc mediates a novel form of
intercellular synaptic plasticity through a virus-like signaling mechanism.
The synaptic mechanisms of memory storage are poorly understood. Furthermore, why evolution exploited viral
machinery to alter synaptic strength is unknown. This research plan will focus on how Arc’s virus-like properties
have been co-opted to encode learned experiences and store information. To date, I have combined molecular
and biochemical assays with various imaging techniques to elucidate how the Arc virus contributes to memory
formation. I have used a novel Arc reporter system that dually labels both nascent Arc protein and mRNA to
visualize Arc trafficking and release from living neurons during LTP. I have demonstrated that transferred Arc
mRNA is translated in recipient neurons to induce AMPAR loss. The precise mechanisms governing how Arc
virus-like signaling alters recipient cell function has yet to be determined. During the F99 phase, I propose to
determine the intracellular trafficking and kinetics of Arc mediated viral signaling. In Aim 1.1, I will determine the
intracellular trafficking of transferred Arc protein and mRNA. In Aim 1.2, I will determine the kinetics of transferred
Arc EV uptake and AMPAR loss. During the K00 phase, I will study how activity-dependent release of
extracellular vesicles alters the neuronal circuits that store memories. I hypothesize that neurons encoding
learned experiences release EVs in an activity-dependent manner to shape the neuronal circuitry that will store
memories. To test this, I will combine my current in vitro skillset with behavioral paradigms, the development of
novel molecular tools, imaging techniques, and large scale sequencing."
11003517,"ABSTRACT
In the United States, Black and Hispanic women (BHW) have the greatest risks of poverty, type 2 diabetes (T2D),
and depression, the scope and intersection of which epitomize a syndemic. In the context of HIV, the economic,
metabolic, and mental health risks are even greater, but they remain inadequately examined. Although
depression disproportionately affects women with T2D and HIV, it is often missed when the three co-occur.
Increased potential for missed care is of particular concern for BHW, who experience disproportionate
comorbidity, socioeconomic risks, and mental health misdiagnosis. Elucidating the biology underlying
relationships between poverty, depression, and metabolic health is a critical step toward improving clinical
recognition of depression and identifying potent macro- and molecular-level targets for future research aimed at
eliminating health disparities. Diagnosis-agnostic approaches suggest that depressive subtypes are differentially
linked to socioeconomic disadvantage, metabolic indices, epigenetic age acceleration, and gut-brain axis (gut
microbiome/neurobiological) dysregulation. Because environmental factors (e.g., nutrition, stress) impact gut
microbes, the gut-brain axis may be a critical point at which poverty affects the body and a key pathway in the
perpetuation of health disparities. Informed by the NIMHD Research Framework, the proposed observational
cross-sectional study focuses on experiences of poverty across biological, behavioral, physical/built
environment, and sociocultural domains at individual, interpersonal, and community levels to examine the
influence experiences of poverty (low SES, adversity, material needs) on mental and metabolic health. Data from
2 cohorts of predominantly BHW with lower SES, with and without HIV will be utilized. In Aims 1 and 2, we will
leverage data from women (N~2000) who participated in an NIMDH co-funded U01 study. In Aim 1 we will
examine relationships among experiences of poverty, epigenetic aging, and mental and metabolic health, and
in Aim 2 we will examine relationships among experiences of poverty, the gut microbiome, and mental and
metabolic health. In exploratory Aim 3 we will use fMRI data from the NIMH-funded P30 Clinical Outcomes
Cohort (N~100 women) to characterize the gut-brain axis by identifying gut microbiome correlates of depression-
linked neurobiological substrates. The proposed research and training plan, carefully designed with guidance
from an experienced, well-funded, and engaged team of expert mentors, will allow the candidate to build on prior
expertise and fill training gaps in 1) integrating multiple -omic (epigenetic, microbiome) approaches, 2)
bioinformatic approaches to analyzing the gut microbiome, and 3) utilizing neuroimaging data to examine brain-
based symptoms. Closing these scientific and training gaps will augment the candidate’s strong trajectory toward
independence and set the stage for a longitudinal R01 examining the epigenetic aging and microbiome effects
of poverty on mental and metabolic health in HIV to identify objective, sentinel indicators to prompt timely clinical
action—an urgently needed step toward eradicating health disparities and realizing health equity for BHW."
11005104,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) has substantially reduced the risk of lethal graft-versus-host disease
(GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT). However, like other forms of GVHD
prophylaxis, PTCy still relies upon passive graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) to prevent disease relapse.
Progression-free survival after alloHCT is largely limited to 41-50%. Thus, concurrent GVHD and leukemia
relapse prevention remains a critical unmet need in transplantation. Innovation in alloHCT must now
maintain GVHD prevention at the level of PTCy and add tools to directly reduce relapse and not simply
maintain or preserve GVL. Distinct from pharmacologic immune suppression, we have developed novel,
human, CD83-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells for concurrent protection against relapse of
CD83+ leukemia as well as GVHD. CD83 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. We show CD83 is
expressed on human myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and alloreactive T cells
implicated in GVHD. Importantly, we have demonstrated that CD83 CAR T cells kill leukemia in vivo and
eradicate GVHD without impairing antiviral immunity. Further, CD83 is largely absent from hematopoietic stem
cells, myeloid progenitors, and neutrophils, limiting the risk for on-target/off-tumor toxicity or myeloid aplasia.
We also developed an ‘OR’ logic gated CD19/CD83 CAR T that can kill B cell ALL that expresses either CD19
OR CD83 via a shared activating endodomain. We show that our ‘OR’ gated CD19/CD83 CAR T can
overcome CD19 antigen loss, which is clinically seen in 25% of ALL patients after treatment with CD19 mono-
CAR T. In this application, we will (Aim 1, mouse experiments) test whether human CD83-targeted CAR T cells
can concurrently prevent leukemia relapse and GVHD, as compared to standard PTCy. To parallel expected
initial clinical trials, we will also investigate the sequential use of CD83 CAR T consolidation after PTCy to
eliminate leukemia relapse and GVHD. Our preliminary data demonstrates that CD83 is expressed on CD4+
conventional T cells during acute GVHD, as well as B cells and T helper follicular cells during chronic GVHD.
Thus, (Aim 2, biomarker validation study) we will investigate whether CD83 is a biomarker and therapeutic
target among effectors of acute and chronic GVHD onset and therapeutic response. Successful completion of
this work will guide the seamless transition from discovery to clinical translation of human CD83 CAR T cells to
concurrently eliminate life-threatening relapse and GVHD after alloHCT."
11005114,"In an era of improved survival due to modern antiretroviral therapy (ART), liver disease has become a major
cause of morbidity and mortality among HIV-infected persons causing death in 15–17% of HIV-infected patients.
Whereas the rate of alcohol abuse is approximately 4.6% in the general U.S. population, 8% of HIV-infected
individuals in U.S. cohorts can be classified as heavy drinkers. Despite the great progress in the development of
efficient and less liver-toxic ART, current ART regimens do not eliminate all symptoms associated with HIV-
induced pathology in various organs, including the liver. HIV-induced liver fibrosis is a frequent event in people
living with HIV (PLWH), and it is further potentiated by alcohol use disorders (AUD). Previously, we have shown
that hepatocytes exposed to HIV and ethanol express HIV RNA and HIV proteins and secrete the highest levels
of extracellular vesicles (EVs/exosomes). These EVs may program the activation of non-parenchymal liver cells,
including hepatic stellate cells (HSC) to promote the fibrosis progression. However, it is not clear which
components of exosome cargo are responsible for HSC activation. Here, we explore the possibility that liver
fibrogenic effects are induced by HIV proteins contained in hepatocyte-derived EVs. In this regard, we will focus
on HIV proteins post-translationally modified with ubiquitin-like ISG15, the product of interferon-stimulated genes
(ISGs) that promotes protein ISGylation to reduce toxicity of HIV proteins and decrease its release with EVs. In
preliminary experiments, we demonstrated that protein ISGylation is suppressed in HIV-infected hepatocytes
treated with ethanol metabolites and the engulfment of these exosomes by HSC induced their pro-fibrotic
activation. These data allowed us to generate the hypothesis: Ethanol metabolism sorts of HIV proteins to
exosomes via suppression of protein ISGylation in hepatocytes. These exosomes with non-ISGylated HIV
protein cargo are internalized by hepatic stellate cells (HSC) to induce pro-fibrotic activation. This hypothesis will
be tested in two Specific Aims: Aim1: To study the effects of ethanol metabolism on HIV protein ISGylation in
hepatocytes and subsequent release of HIV proteins with exosomes; Aim 2: To elucidate the effects of
exosomes derived from HIV-ethanol exposed hepatocytes on pro-fibrotic activation of hepatic stellate cells
(HSC). Here, we will use multiple in vitro and in vivo approaches. Our experimental results will offer strong
translatable potential into clinical practice by clarifying one of the mechanisms of HIV-alcohol-induced liver
fibrosis development, which requires therapeutic interventions additional to ART to prevent liver disease
progression."

Cellular therapies, in which living cells are the drug administered to patients, have the potential to advance treatment for a
variety of inherited and acquired diseases. In particular, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T therapies have shown
remarkable efficacy in certain hematological cancers. The first generation of approved CAR-T therapies rely on viral
vectors for cellular reprogramming. Viral vectors have enabled the transduction of tough-to-transfect primary T cells but
have several drawbacks related to their relatively lengthy manufacturing processes, immunogenicity, and potential for
insertional mutagenesis. Furthermore, the field is trending towards more complex reprogramming methods, such as
multiple gene edits via CRISPR technology, that are not compatible with typical packaging limits associated with viral
approaches. Electroporation is a well-known method for delivery of DNA, RNA, and proteins into cells, that is recognized
as the leading replacement for viral delivery. CyteQuest is dedicated to address the need for a flexible electroporation
platform that can facilitate discovery and easily scale cell therapy manufacturing from the research level (low-volume) to
the clinical level (high-volume). CyteQuest has developed a scalable electroporation platform to optimize transfection
parameters and deliver cargo efficiently and reproducibly at high throughput. The platform incorporates a single use,
continuous-flow fluidic system designed to integrate with automated cell processing approaches. The key objectives of
this proposal are to: (1) design, construct, and test optimization instrument prototypes capable of multiplexed
electroporation (up to parallel 8 channels) to enable rapid optimization of transfection parameters and use these
instruments with academic and clinical collaborators to advance their cell therapy programs; and (2) design, construct and
test manufacturing instrument prototypes capable of rapid delivery of cargo to mid and high volumes of cells to enable
GMP-compatible cell manufacturing within a closed system. CyteQuest’s goal is to expand the availability of cellular
therapy to treat a wider range of diseases and extend treatment to a much broader patient community."

10999718,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Fibroblasts are stromal cells that are critical to both wound repair and the support and regulation of tissue-
resident immune cells; when dysregulated, they drive pathologic scarring and maladaptive immunity. While the
Central Nervous System (CNS) is an immunoprivileged site, brain and spinal cord inflammation, injury, and
pathologic aging all disrupt this delicate balance, leading to increased immune cell activation and infiltration, and
contributing to a range of neuropsychiatric diseases. Although fibroblasts are essentially absent from CNS
parenchyma, they are abundant at CNS borders, and perturbations drive the expansion and infiltration of
fibroblasts, potentially regulating both acute brain injury and the long-term generation of de novo immune niches,
which themselves can alter CNS function. However, the regulatory mechanisms and impacts of CNS fibroblast-
immune crosstalk are poorly understood. Our preliminary data show that lesional CNS fibroblasts expand in
mouse models of brain injury, transiently adopting a myofibroblast-like state that requires fibroblast-intrinsic
TGF signaling and is spatially correlated with macrophages. Mice with inducible myofibroblast loss have
enlarged CNS lesions and sub-acute CNS functional deficits. The myofibroblast program subsides, yet
fibroblasts persist for months, intimately associate with late lesional CNS lymphocytes, and are necessary and
sufficient to support lymphocytes. Spatial transcriptomics indicate a lesional transition from an early
myofibroblast to a late immunoregulatory state. We hypothesize that CNS damage promotes early myofibroblast
expansion, requiring macrophages and TGF activation, to drive wound contraction and limit CNS functional
loss, followed by a transition to an immunoregulatory fibroblast state that persists and creates de novo CNS
lymphocyte niches. The specific goals of this proposal are to understand how CNS fibroblast-macrophage
interactions govern responses to brain damage and establishment of lymphoid niches. Here we will focus on
three related questions: (1) How do early injury-associated myofibroblasts regulate CNS damage and functional
impairment? (2) What are the cells and signals that regulate CNS fibroblast state transition? (3) How do late
CNS immunofibroblasts regulate T-cell accumulation and function? Successful completion of the proposed work
will illuminate how brain fibroblasts regulate early CNS damage responses and late immune cell accumulation,
laying the foundation for future work in humans and driving therapeutic approaches that target stromal cells to
modulate CNS immunity and function."

Maternal viral infections during pregnancy may result in catastrophic outcomes for her health as well as for her
developing fetus. Recent emerging virus epidemics and pandemics such as those with Ebola Virus (EBOV),
Zika Virus (ZIKV) and SARS-CoV-2 have highlighted the impact of viral infection on pregnancy outcomes. Yet
a dearth of data exists pertaining to viral infection and pathogenesis in the placenta and the role of the placenta
in viral transmission to the fetus. In pregnancy, EBOV infection of pregnant mother results in ~100% fatality for
her fetus or neonate with ~60% maternal mortality. Placental immunostaining from EVD outbreaks in Africa
demonstrate viral antigen in placental tissues as well as viral RNA in neonates or fetuses of infected mothers.
This suggests vertical transmission of virus from mother to fetus. However, rigorous experimental evaluation of
maternal transmission and placental infection has not been performed. The tropism of EBOV for placental
cells, mechanisms of cellular entry and route of infection from mother to fetus are currently unknown. The long-
term goal of this proposal is to understand the biology of EBOV in pregnancy through understanding a) the
tropism of EBOV within placental tissues that may lead to the transplacental transmission of virus from mom to
baby as well as b) cell surface receptors utilized by EBOV within placental tissues. Aim1 will seek to define the
tropism of EBOV in the placenta in early and late pregnancy. For these tropism studies, we will use a model
virus, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing EBOV glycoprotein (rVSV/EBOV GP), to examine viral
tropism in placental and fetal tissues. Using this model, we will explore the role of maternal and placental
macrophages as well as placental trophoblasts driving tropism. In Aim 2, we will investigate the role of
phosphatidylserine (PS) receptors in the placental infection and transmission of virus from placenta to the
fetus. In Aim 3, collaborative efforts by Dr. Andrea Marzi at Rocky Mountain Laboratories will utilize mouse-
adapted EBOV (maEBOV) in WT C57BL/6 mouse timed-pregnancies to evaluate virus load and tropism at
later gestational times. Further, maEBOV-infected placental and fetal tissues will be evaluated for targeted
innate immune responses. The data garnered from these targeted and rigorous experiments will establish the
first pregnancy model of EBOV, allowing us to mechanistically explore EBOV tropism required for the virus to
traffic from dams to fetuses. These studies will provide fundamental information on EBOV biology that will aid
in the discovery or development of therapeutic interventions for EBOV infection during pregnancy."

 Parkinson’s disease (PD), a progressive and complex neurodegenerative disorder, manifests with motor
and non-motor symptoms that, only partially and for a limited time, can respond to adequate therapy. Despite
the similar incidence of PD, disease management of Hispanic patients with PD is poorer than that of white non-
Hispanics, and their participation in clinical trials does not reflect expected values (well below 5% versus
expected values around 20%). Together with other evidence, these observations are an expression of
healthcare disparity for Hispanic patients with PD and suggest an underutilization of proper healthcare, socio-
economic disadvantage, stigma, and cultural differences. Moreover, the scant Hispanic participation in clinical
trials further reinforces the vicious cycle of inadequate care. The primary goal of this proposal is to understand
the reasons, including the stigma and cultural differences, that foster this healthcare disparity and to develop
strategies to remove some of these barriers in the Hispanic community of the New York City area (around 25%
of the population). We will employ programs promoting outreach, awareness, and education and enhance
participation in research studies to reach these goals. This work will be performed collaborativelly with the
Parkinson’s Foundation, which, has been working to increase PD awareness in Hispanic communities. The
plan's first step involves the selection, training, and monitoring of local health educators (promotores de salud)
and community stakeholders who are part of the NYC Hispanic communities. Together with the promotores de
salud and in conjunction with other “passive recruitment” instruments (i.e., newsletters, social media, PD-
related websites), we will then provide PD education to Hispanic communities in NYC (Aim 1). To verify the
feasibility and efficacy of this strategy, we also propose prospective studies in which PD Hispanic patients will
be recruited to demonstrate, based on recent evidence, that exercise and multidisciplinary care significantly
improve the life quality of patients and caregivers. Here, we will assess the feasibility, adherence, and retention
of Hispanic patients with PD in a study determining the effects of a two-week inpatient rehabilitation program
immediately after this program and six months later (Aim 2). We will use a similar approach for an outpatient
program study for Hispanic patients with PD (Aim 3). Importantly, for both Aims 2 and 3, we will monitor
patients’ participation and gather feedback during and after these prospective studies to enhance Hispanic
engagement in research. In summary, the proposed studies will develop outreach models and sustainable
partnerships with community-based organizations to promote research efforts and disseminate research
findings in the Hispanic community. These models can be used as infrastructure for future clinical studies,
education, and implementation of better clinical care for the Hispanic population. In addition, these studies will
help validate novel complementary approaches for the care of PD that can improve the quality of life of patients
with PD beyond cultural barriers, improving minorities’ well-being and reducing health disparities."

With the growing number of RNA therapeutics approved for clinical uses and the fundamental advantages of
using RNA in regulating protein expression, vaccines, genome editing, and targeting ligands, RNA has attracted
substantial recent interest from both academic institutions and the pharmaceutical industry. Unless the RNA
sequences of interest are very short (< 60 bp), in vitro transcription is often the desired approach for synthesis.
Due to their inherent instability against enzyme degradation, RNAs for use in biotechnology and medicine require
chemical modifications. Conventional T7 RNA polymerase (T7RNAP) is highly efficient in making long RNAs,
but it has been difficult to incorporate chemically modified nucleotides. In contrast, T7RNAP mutants can
incorporate chemically modified nucleotides but the yields of transcription are significantly lower, driving up the
costs for both biomedical research and healthcare. By investigating the key parameters that influence T7RNAP
activity, we have identified the barriers that hinder wild-type T7RNAP from accepting modified substrates and
developed formulations and protocols to address them. Based on these innovations, here, we propose to develop
a new in vitro transcription kit that combines the benefits of both worlds, the high efficiency and low cost of wild-
type T7RNAP, and the tolerance of modified nucleotides of mutant T7RNAPs. This kit will generate chemical-
modified serum-stable RNAs with a minimum 10-fold increase in yield over current best-performing kits, thus
drastically improving the affordability of current and future RNA drugs."

Medicaid is the largest payer for mental health care in the US, providing coverage for more than a quarter of
those with serious mental illness. Yet, despite a greater burden of mental illness and more chronic physical
disease, Medicaid enrollees have especially high rates of unmet care needs due to low behavioral health
provider participation in Medicaid networks and fragmented payment and delivery systems. Community Health
Centers (CHCs) make up a critical component of the safety-net for low-income and underserved populations.
CHCs have been at the forefront of medical home demonstrations and have increasingly integrated behavioral
health services and personnel into comprehensive primary care practices. While a confluence of federal and
state policy initiatives, as well as efforts on behalf of advocacy groups and professional associations, have
prioritized initiatives to integrate behavioral health with primary care for Medicaid enrollees, uptake of
evidenced-based models has been hampered by administrative and payment hurdles. To date, little is known
about the extent of integrated behavioral health among CHCs, including which patients have access to
integrated services, how integration is associated with outcomes, and how policies like state Medicaid benefit
design may be promoting clinical integration in CHCs. The proposed study will leverage a novel practice-level
dataset collected by the research team linked to national Medicaid claims and a variety of publicly available
data sources to examine the drivers and consequences of integrated behavioral health in CHCs. We will field a
survey among a nationally representative sample of CHC delivery sites to assess the current landscape of
integrated behavioral health using a validated instrument, determine the organizational and state-policy factors
associated with greater integration in these settings, and assess the extent to which clinic-level integration
improves access to care, quality, and health spending for Medicaid enrollees with mental illness. Further we
will develop and disseminate a new claims-based measure of behavioral health integration that will efforts to
track integrated behavioral health in CHCs and permit future research and policy evaluation without the need
of surveying clinics directly. Through this work we seek to provide timely and generalizable data on how efforts
to integrate care in CHCs are delivering value for state Medicaid programs. We expect this work to inform
resource allocation and policy decision-making to enhance access to evidenced-based systems of care for
enrollees with mental illness."

Manganese (Mn) is a well-established neurotoxicant that likely induces neurodegeneration through
inflammatory pathways. Millions of people worldwide experience high levels of environmental Mn from point
source emissions or associated fugitive dust. In the first five years of the SMELTER (South African
Manganese EnvironmentaL NeuroToxic Effects Research) study, we assembled a cohort of >800 Black
African residents, including >700 exposed to Mn emissions from one of the world’s largest Mn smelters in
Meyerton, South Africa. We developed and validated study assessment tools in the appropriate South African
languages, measured environmental Mn in Meyerton and a comparable non-exposed reference community
(Ethembalethu), examined participants using the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale motor subsection
part 3 (UPDRS3), and evaluated participants using targeted cognitive and mood assessments. We
demonstrated that Meyerton residents had markedly poorer performance in these outcomes as compared to
Ethembalethu residents. These neurological health effects were associated with concentrations ~100-200
ng/m3 of Mn as particulate matter (PM) <2.5 µm in diameter (PM2.5-Mn), a level consistent with other point
sources throughout the world. In this proposal, we will build on these accomplishments by investigating
whether Mn exposure is also associated with progression of the observed motor and cognitive health effects
in this same cohort and to estimate longitudinal, in addition to cross-sectional, associations. We successfully
employed this approach in our studies of Mn-exposed welders in the U.S. in whom longitudinal studies were
required to show dose-response effects. To better characterize Mn exposure and mechanism of neurotoxicity,
we will incorporate brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including sequences designed to assess
neuroinflammation. We will also expand our air monitoring to explore the contribution of PM size on motor,
cognitive, and non-motor health outcomes, as well as neuroinflammation as assessed by brain MRI. Finally,
we will implement a dissemination plan to inform community and national stakeholders of study results. Our
overarching hypothesis is that environmental Mn exposure two orders of magnitude below contemporary
occupational exposure is associated with progression of both parkinsonism and cognitive dysfunction and that
neuroinflammation mediates the relationship between environmental Mn exposure and clinical neurotoxicity.
We further hypothesize that particle sizes <1µm (i.e., the more inspirable particles within PM2.5) will be more
strongly associated with clinical outcomes than larger sizes. Accomplishing these aims will inform
international environmental Mn regulations and will address an important environmental justice concern
identified by a community of participants typically underrepresented in environmental health research. The
proposed aims address the NIEHS strategic theme, “Promoting Translation – Data to Knowledge to Action.”"

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant cause of death and disability in the US. The true extent of TBI may
be underestimated, with many cases of asymptomatic TBI going undiagnosed, often referred to as a “silent
epidemic.” Recent meta-analyses suggest that head injuries increase the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's
disease (AD). As a result, there is an urgent need for strategies to prevent TBI-induced AD dementia and
research to uncover its underlying mechanisms. Notably, TBI often results in significant damage to the
blood-brain barrier (BBB). Even a single mild TBI can lead to persistent BBB breakdown. Additionally, TBI
commonly damages brain microvascular endothelial cells, crucial components of the BBB. Both
cerebrovascular dysfunction and BBB damage are early and critical events in AD pathology. Therefore, it is
reasonable to hypothesize that TBI-related BBB breakdown may contribute to the aggravated progression of AD.
However, the causal relationship between disrupted endothelial cell and BBB function caused by TBI and the
accelerated AD progression remains unclear. In this study, we propose noninvasive laser therapy as a potential
therapeutic approach for brain protection in a mild closed-head injury (CHI)-accelerated AD dementia model. To
test our overall hypothesis, Aim 1 will determine the impact of pulsed laser therapy on CHI-accelerated AD
pathogenesis in a novel AD rat model and elucidate the role of DDR-senescent signaling in this process. Aim 2
will test the hypothesis that endothelial cell senescence and BBB damage represent significant pathological
links between TBI and AD. Additionally, we will establish a mechanistic angle to determine whether H2S
signaling molecule is associated with laser protection in CHI-AD. Aim 3 will examine the hypothesis that laser
therapy can target ion-containing cystathionine-β-synthase/H2S system to enhance DNA/vascular repair and
functional neurovascular coupling during CHI-AD pathogenesis. The proposed research is innovative both
technically and mechanistically. The studies have the potential for profound impact as they aim to elucidate the
mechanisms underlying TBI-accelerated AD progression, identify novel target for laser therapy in CHI-AD, and
assess the efficacy and utility of this emerging noninvasive therapy in the early stages of TBI-AD progression."

The National Mesothelioma Virtual Bank (NMVB) network consents patients to provide biospecimens (blood
products and tissue) together with demographic data, occupational history and clinical data (stage, treatment
and survival information) to the mesothelioma research community. In addition, protein biomarkers, genomic
and imaging data are also collected by researchers and shared for future studies. The University of Pittsburgh is
the coordinating site for the NMVB protocol, which is also in place at four partnering sites, New York
University, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Maryland and University of
Pennsylvania. Our specific aims are to: 1) Continue to serve the mesothelioma cancer research community by
collecting and distributing tissue, blood and the aforementioned data as well as increasing the NMVB cohort to
2200 patients. We will continue to document and continually evaluate the usefulness of the NMVB to the
scientific community and measure its impact in collaboration with the Mesothelioma Applied Research
Foundation; 2) Expand the network to the Baylor College of Medicine which increases both the geographic and
racial diversity of the NMVB cohort. We will also promote our mesothelioma data model nationally and
internationally to encourage linkage to other registries; and 3) Our continued innovation aim is to automate
annotation of biospecimens through extraction of clinical, outcomes, and pathology data from electronic health
records and cancer registry systems through a cost-effective open source tool for Research Electronic Data
Capture or REDCap. We will deploy and implement scalable, cost-effective tools to maximize the effectiveness
of the data extraction process across collaborating sites which will allow linkage to other national and
international tissue and data sharing networks."

Off-target safety problems are the single leading cause of preclinical drug failures. As a result, specificity
profiling has become an FDA requirement for monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) as well as other emerging
biotherapeutic categories such as CAR-T cell therapy. Current methods for profiling the specificity of
biotherapeutics, primarily tissue cross-reactivity studies (TCR) and spotted protein arrays, are poorly predictive
of cross-reactivity against the native human proteome, have low sensitivity, and are difficult to interpret. A
novel approach for specificity profiling is needed to better predict off-target binding of MAbs and de-risk
biotherapeutic discovery programs. Integral Molecular is the industry leader in membrane protein antibody
discovery and characterization. As a result of previous SBIR funding, we developed a new technology for
specificity profiling and deorphaning, the Membrane Proteome Array (MPA). The MPA represents 93% of the
human extracellular proteome expressed in their native conformation in live cells. Recently, the MPA was the
first technology accepted into the FDA’s ISTAND pilot program for drug development tools (DDT).
Development of the MPA would have a large impact on the clinical pipelines of nearly every biopharmaceutical
company and has significant commercial potential."

Use of bisphosphonate (BP) medications for the prevention of fractures is declining, partially due to patient and
provider fears about the occurrence of atypical femur fractures (AFF), which are clearly associated with long-
term bisphosphonate use. Many individuals are choosing to not use these medications at all rather than risk
having this rare outcome. This decision may leave individuals at high risk of morbidity and mortality. Balancing
the risk of typical osteoporosis-related fractures, such as hip or vertebral fractures, with the risk of the much
rarer AFF, is an important component of decision-making by physicians and patients about medication use.
Thus, the RFA issued by NIA and NIAMS solicited applications for secondary analyses of existing datasets to
provide evidence about appropriate strategies for long-term osteoporosis therapies, including drug holidays,
and to better understand their risks and benefits (RFA-AG-22-018). Our parent grant will address these issues
by combining individual-level data from three large, population-based cohort studies with radiographically
verified AFFs, comprehensive longitudinal medication exposure, data harmonized definitions of other
covariables, and centrally coordinated statistical programming; this project focuses on 1) examining the risks of
long-term use of BP for the prevention of AFF by determining the independent effects of BP treatment and
drug holidays on AFF risk, including the potential interplay between pre-holiday duration of treatment and
duration of holiday and 2) developing and validating predictive models incorporating patterns of long-term BP
treatment, drug holidays and clinical risk factors, to comprehensively model the expected fracture protection
and potential harms for individual patients and evaluate the group-level balance between AFF risk and
osteoporosis-related fracture prevention. Three other projects with diverse sets of aims and methodologies
using combinations of claims and electronic health records data were also funded to advance the research
program. This administrative supplement is aimed to support the coordination and collaboration of a
consortium consisting of the four R01-funded projects that are leveraging existing large databases and cohorts
to better understand the risks and benefits of long-term osteoporosis therapy and drug holiday."
11003477,"Project Summary
Modern metabolomics have revolutionized biology and biomedical research. It is now possible to identify specific
metabolic biomarkers associated with disease or response to treatment, which can translate into improved
diagnostics. However, key gaps in knowledge remain that limit the impact of metabolomics. First, advances in
analytical instrumentation that fueled the growth of metabolomics are limited to biofluids or extracts of tissues or
cells. Metabolism is a highly dynamic process that can change rapidly with environmental conditions, but most
metabolomics techniques are not able to monitor the dynamic process directly in vivo. Rather, when they are
measured at all, dynamics are measured by discrete sampling, which leads to multiple samples and added
variance. A second limitation in metabolomics is our ability to identify unknown metabolites with high confidence.
Many of the “features” measured by LC-MS or NMR in metabolomics studies remain unknown, limiting the
biological impact.
Our laboratory has recently developed methods to address these gaps in knowledge. Through NIGMS funding,
we have developed improved NMR probes that allow for greater sensitivity in NMR measurements. This is
important because NMR is the best method for unknow metabolite identification. Our current probe will be
commissioned in February 2022 and is optimized for 13C detection at 21.1 T (900 MHz 1H); we expect that it will
provide the highest possible 13C NMR sensitivity available. This technology allows for data that will substantially
improve our ability to identify unknown metabolites. We have also developed metabolite “fraction libraries”, which
start with chemical separation of a specific sample followed by measurement of each fraction by 1D and 2D NMR
and LC-MS/MS. The data from a fraction library will allow unknowns to be identified by efficiently linking the NMR
and LC-MS data. In this MIRA we will make a fraction library knowledgebase by developing tools to connect the
different datasets. We have also developed an approach called continuous in vivo metabolism by NMR (CIVM-
NMR). We have applied CIVM-NMR to growing Neurospora crassa, a filamentous fungus that has been used to
link genetics to metabolism. We can monitor the growth of N. crassa in real-time with about 1 minute resolution
for over 1 week. This allows us to measure quantitative metabolic details of all the metabolites and lipids with
concentrations greater than 25 µM. We have made computational tools to extract over 300 growth curves from
a single CIVM-NMR dataset, allowing us to functionally characterize the metabolic changes over time as a
function of carbon source, temperature, or oxygen availability. In this MIRA project, we will expand CIMV-NMR
by measuring metabolic mutants under different environments and build a web server that connects all the data."

In this renewal application, Benjamin Chi, MD, MSc seeks dedicated support for research and mentorship of
patient-oriented researchers at the intersection of HIV, maternal and child health, and global health. This
proposal builds upon an impressive K24 track record to date: individual mentorship of 26 early-stage
investigators (including 10 NIH K awardees), work to enhance mentorship capacity in international academic
institutions, and high levels of research productivity. He seeks to build upon this successful mentoring program,
in ways that broaden impact and scope and are attuned to his current career stage. Candidate: Dr. Chi is a
recognized thought leader in the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT). He has led clinical
trials, observational cohorts, modeling studies, household surveys, and—with support in the first K24 cycle—
implementation research. Over the past five years, he has taken on leadership roles at his home institution, but
mentorship remains the cornerstone of his academic career. This award provides protected effort for such
activities, allowing him to refine his approach at a critical career juncture. Mentoring Plan/Environment: Dr. Chi
has an established track record in research training, including leadership of multiple NIH-funded initiatives. His
approach to mentorship has been highly productive but time-intensive. In this renewal, he introduces new
activities that foster group and peer mentoring, emphasize joint learning, and provide support for new mentors.
He will leverage UNC’s extensive resources to accomplish this goal, including NIH-funded centers and training
programs, networks and collaborations, and global health institutes and departments. This includes professional
development designed to improve his mentoring skills and support mentees on their path to research
independence. Research Plan: This proposal has a sharpened topical focus. HIV prevention for pregnant and
postpartum women is an emerging global priority in the field of maternal health and PMTCT; however, biological,
clinical, cultural, and social factors that are unique to these periods are often overlooked. Through mentored
research, this program seeks to develop this expertise in early-stage investigators. Three projects are described
that will collectively provide valuable insights about HIV risk and the use of HIV prevention interventions (in this
case, pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP) among pregnant and postpartum women. Scientifically, these aims
follow a rational and clear progression: (1) characterizing HIV risk among pregnant and postpartum women, (2)
describing the alignment of perceived HIV risk and PrEP use during these periods, and (3) designing and
assessing a new intervention to improve this alignment. Each of these studies build upon funded NIH research
led by Dr. Chi and his collaborators. They represent a body of work that will remain relevant as the HIV prevention
landscape continues to evolve. Importantly, this framework provides mentees with access to robust research
across three African countries, a multidisciplinary team of collaborators and co-mentors, and a rich learning
environment that spans two continents."
11003928,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over half of all new HIV infections in the US in 2017 occurred in 48 high-incidence counties and rural states
known as HIV “hotspots”, indicating a need to intensify HIV prevention efforts in these regions. Preexposure
prophylaxis (PrEP) can reduce new HIV infections by 99%, but PrEP use is limited in hotspots in the South
where HIV incidence is highest. The criminal justice system is a prime location to engage persons in PrEP, as
many people who pass through jails and prisons have risk factors for acquiring HIV. Implementing PrEP in jails
in particular, where medically underserved Black and Latinx populations are over-represented, can have a high
public health impact given rapid turnover back to the community. Because virtually no jails in the South offer
PrEP due to resource constraints and competing priorities, there is a critical need for strategies to implement
PrEP in this setting. Our central hypothesis is that a rigorously-developed PrEP implementation strategy can
improve linkage to community PrEP care for persons released from southern jails. The objective of this
proposal is to develop, implement and evaluate a multicomponent PrEP implementation strategy for the Dallas
County Jail, the 8th largest jail in the nation and located in an HIV hotspot. We will leverage our robust
partnerships with stakeholders in the jail, public health department, and community as we follow a well-
established EPIS (exploration, preparation, implementation, sustainment) framework. The implementation
strategy will include locally-adapted, evidence-based tools for identifying candidates for PrEP, engaging them
in shared decision-making about PrEP, and navigating them to PrEP care at community reentry. We will
rigorously evaluate our implementation strategy using a type 3 effectiveness-implementation hybrid study,
which prioritizes implementation outcomes while also collecting clinical outcomes. Our specific aims are to: 1)
Assess facilitators and barriers to PrEP evaluations in jail and linkage to PrEP at jail release; 2) Refine a
multicomponent PrEP implementation strategy for the Dallas County Jail; and 3) Implement and evaluate the
PrEP implementation strategy. We will use mixed-methods to evaluate implementation processes (feasibility,
acceptability, penetration and sustainment) and clinical outcomes for PrEP evaluations and linkage, and an
interrupted time series to measure changes in HIV/STI testing and diagnoses. Our study team includes experts
in HIV, PrEP, implementation science, qualitative research, and clinical care for incarcerated populations. This
project is significant in its potential to impact HIV incidence in a highly affected population in an HIV hotspot.
The work is innovative in using implementation science to improve PrEP for incarcerated populations and is
directly responsive to NOT-MH-20-024, “Implementation Science to Advance the United States HIV Prevention
and Treatment Goals.” Our strategy is scalable and with guidance from Dissemination Consultants, can serve
as a model for future public health initiatives in other criminal justice settings, directing PrEP in a patient-
centered manner to those most likely to benefit in order to maximize impact on HIV incidence."
11003934,"Project Summary/Abstract – From Parent Grant
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a form of dementia characterized by memory loss and progressive cognitive
impairments. The leading hypotheses over the past decade have assumed that these symptoms are due to
accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau proteins that lead to neurodegeneration. However, treatments that
reduce Aβ levels have largely been ineffective in clinical trials and strategies to target tau have proven difficult.
Numerous failed drug trials have raised concerns that reducing pathological proteins without preventing or
reversing functional changes in the affected cells and networks may be insufficient for treatment. This highlights
a need to examine how AD pathology impacts brain regions, connections, and activity patterns that are important
for memory. By investigating specific circuits that are known to be vulnerable early in disease progression, we
can gain valuable insight into the initial network changes underlying progressive cognitive decline and identify
possible targets for early therapeutic interventions. Given the strong evidence for dysfunction in hippocampal
processing and spatial memory in AD, it is critical to understand whether these changes are driven by abnormal
inputs or local hippocampal changes. The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) provides critical spatial inputs to the
hippocampus and its vulnerability in early AD is well established. Therefore, this proposal will test the hypothesis
that changes in MEC function emerge prior to cognitive decline and hippocampal processing deficits, and provide
an early point of circuit dysfunction that could drive development of memory impairments. In Aim 1, we will first
use in vitro electrophysiology to characterize how intrinsic properties of distinct cell types in MEC and CA1 are
altered during the progression of memory impairments. In Aim 2, we will use silicon probes to simultaneously
record from 512 channels throughout MEC and hippocampus to determine how and when synchrony of single
units and local field potentials (LFPs) within and across regions breaks down in models of AD pathology. In Aim
3, we will use in vivo calcium imaging with miniature microscopes to track the development of spatial coding
deficits across months in MECII, MECIII, and CA1 neurons as mice run on a linear track and explore an open
field. Specialized viral targeting tools will allow us to isolate specific MEC subpopulations and test the hypothesis
that MECII stellate cells exhibit altered spatial coding prior to deficits in CA1. These experiments will use 3 distinct
mouse models of AD pathology and neurodegeneration covering Aβ (APP-KI), tau (P301S), and combinatorial
(3x-Tg) transgenes to identify convergent mechanisms of circuit dysfunction across models. Together, these
aims will isolate specific circuits that break down to produce memory deficits in mouse models of AD pathology."

Background: Radiation therapy (RT) is a core treatment modality that benefits patients with many types of
cancer and can synergize with immune checkpoint blockade therapy. However, delivery of maximally effective
doses of radiation to tumors is limited by collateral damage to normal tissues. We are developing a next-
generation clinical RT platform called PHASER that will deliver ultra-rapid and precise radiation (FLASH) to
decrease damage to normal tissues dramatically. Using a unique preclinical FLASH irradiator we developed for
mice, our preliminary data show enhanced tumor control with FLASH vs. conventional dose rate irradiation as
well as increased infiltration of immune cells into the tumor, suggestive of an immune mediated mechanism.
Hypothesis and objective: We hypothesize that FLASH will demonstrate a superior therapeutic index by
comparison to conventional dose rate RT for multiple cancers, based not only on its precision but also on the
induction of more potent anti-tumor immunity. We will test this hypothesis in experimental models of cancer.
Specific Aims and Study Design: Aim 1: Compare the anti-tumor potency, safety and immunological
effects of FLASH vs conventional dose rate RT in primary tumors: We will evaluate different doses of
FLASH and compare its effects with maximally tolerated doses of conventional dose rate RT in both syngeneic
and patient derived xenograft mouse models. In addition to assessing tumor growth, we will analyze the effects
of FLASH on the immune response, both locally and systemically through the use CyTOF and our
SCAFFOLDS algorithms. This approach will reveal where and which immune cell subsets become activated in
successfully treated animals. We will also assess the immunologic correlates of reduced toxicity from FLASH.
Aim 2: Analyze the therapeutic effects of FLASH alone and in combination with immune checkpoint
antibodies in metastatic disease. To assess our hypothesis that FLASH in combination with PD-1 blockade
will exhibit synergistic anti-tumor effects due to an enhanced system-wide immune response, we will study the
effects of FLASH, alone and in combination with anti-PD-1, on tumors outside the radiation field, and assess
the immune response as in Aim 1. Aim 3: Identify the immune cellular and molecular basis of FLASH
efficacy. We will test the hypothesis that efficacy is dependent on T cells as well as antigen presenting
dendritic cells (DCs) by treating tumors in Rag-2 KO and BATF3 KO mice, respectively, and will elucidate the
role for these cells by transferring T cells or DCs from successfully treated mice to naive mice challenged with
tumor. The specific subsets required for efficacy are expected to be those shown to expand in multiple tissues
in Aim 1. Lastly, we will explore the role of Type I interferon and its receptor on DCs in the efficacy of FLASH.
Expected Results and Impact: These experiments are expected to demonstrate that FLASH in combination
with checkpoint therapy promotes durable tumor regression of primary and metastatic tumors with little
damage to normal tissues, thus setting stage for evaluating FLASH in clinical trials."
11001818,"Brain states are widely distributed patterns of neural activity, a consequence of specific physiological
conditions. Epidemiology demonstrates that early life adversity (ELA) followed by life-threatening fear
increases vulnerability to various mental and physical disorders, possibly by interfering with natural brain
states. Our understanding of natural brain states remains limited. Therefore, characterization of these brain
states, their changes after ELA and subsequent responses to threat, will be paramount to enabling precision
medicine targeting neuromodulatory systems to improve clinical outcomes. In order to define brain states
accurately under each condition and determine endogenous neuromodulation, measurements must be made
brain-wide, longitudinally, and with high spatial resolution.
 In the F99 phase of this proposed research Taylor Uselman will continue developing statistical methods and
computational software to analyze images from his established longitudinal manganese-enhanced MRI
(MEMRI) protocol. In completed experiments, he acquired and processed MEMRI data with and without ELA
before and after exposure to acute threat. In new experiments, he is developing structural equation modeling to
test whether sample covariance between segments in MEMRI images is a meaningful measure of functional
brain architecture. He will then explore data-driven computational algorithms to characterize brain states and
underlying networks in all his longitudinal MEMRI datasets. He will also explore the influence of the
noradrenergic system on brain states, using viral transduction for chemogenetic activation of the locus
coeruleus followed by computational analyses of images acquired by his longitudinal MEMRI protocol. By
fulfilling this aim, Uselman will gain expertise in experimental design, neuroimaging, computational
neuroscience, and exogenous neuromodulation technologies.
 In the K00 phase, Uselman will investigate control of pathological brain states via neuromodulation
technology. Based on his skills and results acquired in Aim 1, he will develop control theory algorithms toward
identification of targets for exogenous modulation of brain states occurring in pathological conditions. He will
then develop neuromodulation technology to influence identified targets for therapeutic intervention and assess
intervention efficacy by imaging.
 The proposed work will yield innovative strategies to enable the identification and characterization of brain
states after ELA, sophisticated open-access software, and a generalizable imaging protocol. Ultimately,
application of these advanced methods to ELA’s effect on brain states will provide a deeper understanding of
increased vulnerabilities after ELA to mental disorders. An additional outcome of this fellowship will be the
preparation of a talented young investigator for a future productive career in brain science."

established auditory/vestibular conferences, the MARC is intentionally low-cost to enhance opportunities for
trainees to attend, while providing a national slate of prominent keynote speakers and broad attendance from
researchers across the Midwest. The 9th MARC was held in 2022 at the University of Michigan, hosted by the
Kresge Hearing Research Institute. It was a great success with 158 in attendance, including 89 trainees. The
10th MARC will be held at NEOMED (Northeast Ohio Medical University) on June 19-21, 2025 and hosted by
the NEOMED Hearing Research Group. The conference has been extremely well-received by past attendees,
and the 10th MARC will improve upon previous iterations by incorporating suggestions from end-of-conference
surveys. The 10th MARC aims to provide a collegial and diverse forum for exchanging the latest ideas,
techniques, and results related to auditory and vestibular research, to foster collaborations, and to advance the
scientific and professional training of the next generation of researchers.
 Located in the Midwest, the MARC’s proximity to a wide range of universities enables us to attract and
engage a diverse range of attendees, helping promote diversity in the field. Travel awards will be reserved for
trainees from underrepresented groups and the conference will be heavily advertised at Midwest universities
serving large, underrepresented populations. Furthermore, a Thursday evening panel discussion will focus on
career advice with an emphasis on supporting and enhancing diversity in the field, and will include
representatives from industry, academia, and federal science administration.
 The conference format will include podium and poster sessions, as well as professional development and
networking opportunities. Each podium session will be anchored by a keynote speaker. Confirmed keynote
speakers include Catherine Carr, Nace Golding, Lisa Goodrich, Jeffrey Holt, Laura Hurley, Ingrid Johnsrude,
Charlie Liberman, and Dan Sanes. A Friday evening event at the Akron Art Museum will focus on translational
and clinical research and achievements in the field. At least half of the podium slots are reserved for
postdoctoral fellows, residents, and graduate students, who will be selected from the abstract submissions.
The sessions will cover a broad range of topics relevant to the NIDCD mission, ranging from molecular biology
in the cochlea to psychoacoustics and translational research, and will feature a diverse group of speakers.
Breakfast, lunch, and coffee breaks will be provided to increase the number of informal opportunities for
trainees to interact with established researchers. Outcomes will be assessed with an end-of-conference survey
that will be provided during breakfast on the final day of the meeting. All attendees will receive a digital

11003556,"Diabetic skin ulcers (DU) represent a major healthcare burden that is known to lead to amputations. It is estimated that 15–20% of all diabetics develop skin wounds across their lifespan. These include wounds caused by trauma and those caused by planned surgery. Notably, the 5-year mortality rate of DFU is higher than most cancers. Majority of these skin wounds are complicated, become chronic and are cared for by surgical and dermatological providers. It is estimated that only half of all diabetics with ulcerative skin wounds survive more than five years after their initial manifestation. The proposed work is inspired by the observation that single nucleotide variations (SNV) are important genetic factors that predispose an individual to diabetic complications. SNV are likely to engage in crosstalk with sequence-specific transcription factors and influence DNA methylation which could silence gene expression required for wound closure. Diabetic ulcer patient-based preliminary genotyping studies, identified greater than 17,000 SNV. Gene ontology analyses identified 53 SNV-containing genes relevant to wound epithelialization. NOTCH1 gene emerged as a major signaling hub associated with DU. Two NOTCH1 specific SNV, rs10870081 and rs34485221 (upstream of NOTCH1 transcription start site) were enriched in human diabetic wound-edge. The significance of SNV in wound closure remains unknown. The proposed work seeks to systematically study SNV and its association with diabetic wound closure in chronic wound patients. The combinatorial approach of collecting SNV, hypermethylation and healing trajectory data from the same patients from a longitudinal cohort study as proposed is likely to establish a new paradigm in the discipline of diabetic wound healing. Systematic patient-based genomic studies of DU are scanty and the proposed work is aimed at seeding a novel paradigm in wound healing research. The following specific aim is proposed: Aim 1. In patients with diabetic ulcer, identify SNV responsible for impaired wound closure. 1.1 Diabetes-dependent SNVs are associated with impaired wound closure. Loci affected by such SNV will be identified and tested for their significance in wound closure. 1.2 The functional significance of diabetes dependent SNV identified above, in the context of impaired wound closure, is determined by hypermethylation status of the corresponding loci."

 Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most performed orthopedic surgeries to relieve joint pain in
patients with end-stage osteoarthritis (OA) or rheumatic arthritis (RA). In the US, over 700,000 TKA procedures
are performed annually. To manage TKA pain patients are commonly prescribed opioids, contributing to a
spiraling opioid epidemic. The misuse and addiction to opioids is a national public health crisis with an
estimated economic burden of $78.5 billion per year. As opioid addiction is now a national health focus, novel
non-opioid and non-pharmacological treatments for postoperative pain are a top scientific priority. There is an
urgent need for a long-lasting, drug-free means of relieving post-TKA pain–which is the overall goal of this
project. Cryoneurolysis is an opioid-sparing, perioperative intervention used to reduce postoperative pain.
Current cryoneurolysis methods apply very low-temperature cryoprobes to freeze peripheral nerves, resulting
in reversible and long-lasting pain relief. However, due to extremely cold temperatures (–88oC and below) in
direct contact with a nerve and surrounding tissues, these methods are not nerve-selective nor easy to
administer. They also are not injectable, making the treatments time-consuming and challenging to adopt in
clinic. Our initial goal – an easier to use, injectable method of cryoneurolysis to reduce postoperative
pain from TKA, significantly reducing or eliminating the use of opioids.
 We invented a novel injectable and nerve-selective cryoneurolysis method that overcomes the
limitations of current options. Neural Ice™ can be injected around sensory peripheral nerves that transmit
pain. We have shown in a rat model that injection of our ice-slurry, formulated to bring peri-nerve temperatures
to around -5oC, extracts enough thermal energy to reversibly disrupt nerve structure and reduce pain sensation
for up to 8 weeks without damage to surrounding tissue. At the end of 2023, we also completed an initial 16-
patient feasibility study showing significant pain reduction response with no serious adverse events (See
Significance). In response to these findings (pre-clinical and clinical) in October 2023 the FDA granted
Brixton Breakthrough Designation.
 In Phase II, we seek to optimize a clinical use device that produces an injectable, biocompatible, and
sterile ice slurry which meets the FDA requirements for an Investigative Device Exemption (IDE) for a
pivotal efficacy trial. With our HEAL Phase I grant we generated single-use, terminally sterilized pre-filled
syringes that contain on-demand injectable slurry for use at point-of-care facilities. In Phase II we seek to
optimize our design for human use (ease, effectiveness, cost, etc.) and test for in-vivo biologic response in rat
model. We will also establish manufacturing of human use system & prepare to submit pivotal trial IDE
application to the FDA at the end of the funding period. If successful, our study will lead to the
development of a novel, long-lasting and non-opioid treatment for patients with post-TKA pain."
11000402,"This application is to request funds to support 15 young investigator travel awards for the annual Winter
Conference on Brain Research (WCBR 2025-2027). This conference is a popular forum for exploring new
developments in the neuroscience field usually with ~500 scientist attendees. There typically are over 80 panel
presentations and poster sessions (excluding the last afternoon) concluding with a special judged poster
session that includes the top-ranking poster submissions predominantly presented by young investigators.
Professional Development Workshops for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty (initiated
in 2015) continue to maintain high attendance annually. Extended periods of time are set aside for breakout
groups, networking, diversity workshops, and scientific discussions. WCBR is an excellent opportunity for
junior investigators and trainees to interact with established investigators in a relaxed atmosphere. The
evaluations of recent conferences highlight the strong impact this meeting typically has on emerging as well as
established scientists. As the travel funds allocated for emerging scientists have not kept pace with the rising
costs of attending small, specialized meetings, we are requesting funding from other sources. We are hoping
that the results of our requests enable us to support a large number of junior investigators to participate in the
meeting. The conference traditionally takes place at a mountain venue in the western USA (rarely in Canada).
The 56th annual meeting will take place in Breckenridge, CO between 1/27/24-2/1/24 and the 57th meeting will
be in Lake Tahoe, CA between 1/24-1/29/25 (venues for future conferences will be decided at the 56th
meeting). For the 2024 WCBR meeting, the keynote speaker, who will also speak at a Brain Talk Town
Meeting open to the entire community, will be Gina Poe, PhD, Lorre Scholars Chair, Professor of Integrative
Biology and Physiology, Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences at UCLA. There is an annual School Outreach
Program organized in collaboration with local middle and high school teachers in which up to 10 WCBR
scientists visit community schools. WCBR’s program is developed annually based on abstract submissions in
August each year. At WCBR 2024, 17 panels and one Pioneer session are specifically on abused drugs and
another 46 panels focus on reward-related topics or more broadly related to CNS plasticity. Thus, a large
proportion of the conference is highly relevant to understanding the neurobiological bases of substance use
disorders (SUDs) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) as well as neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders
consistent with NIDA’s and NIAAA’s missions. The fact that a large proportion of the participants are junior
investigators and a significant number are graduate students and postdocs ensures that this conference has
an impact on how future generations of neuroscientists view these issues."

This grant application seeks funding for the 2024 Santa Cruz Developmental Biology Meeting, which will be
held on the campus of University of California at Santa Cruz from August 23-27, 2024.
This meeting is a biennial, grass-roots meeting organized by and for the scientific community working at the
cutting edge of developmental biology. The Santa Cruz meeting, which has run continuously since 1992, oc-
cupies a unique niche by combining international reputation with a relatively small size (~150 attendees) and a
wholly new line-up of invited speakers at each gathering. As detailed in our application, we have planned for
considerable participation by graduate students and postdocs by including short talks, posters, two work-
shops aimed at career issues, and a career-perspective talk from a prominent scientist whose storied career
pathway epitomizes the multi-disciplinary nature of developmental biology. The meeting format is based
around single-platform sessions and three non-overlapping poster sessions so that all participants are
engaged with the same topic and activity for the entirety of the meeting.
The theme for 2024, “Unifying Principles of Organismal Development”, seeks to highlight common themes as
well as top challenges facing the field, both conceptual and technical, as we seek fresh insights into the
complex mechanisms underlying organismal development, tissue renewal, and the evolution of new forms.
One chief goal of this meeting will be to bring together diverse researchers in an informal setting to highlight
work across a broad spectrum of relevant systems, fostering cross-interaction between research fields and
synthesis of new ideas. A second major goal will be to provide a forum for a diverse group of undergraduates,
graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows to engage with and present their work to leaders in the field
through talks, poster sessions, and informal discussions fostered by an isolated and relaxed campus setting.
Along with a distinguished panel of four senior keynote speakers, the seven platform sessions will feature
scientists working with a wide range of model organisms to address fundamental and emerging questions that
form the basis for modern developmental research. Topics include: Cell-cell Communication, Theory and
Modeling in Development, Active Matter and Mechanics, Convergent and Divergent Morphogenesis, Cellular
Transitions and Plasticity, Information Processing & Gene Regulatory Networks, and New Technologies and
Synthetic Approaches. The discussion that will ensue among the conferees will enhance our inclusive,
multidisciplinary developmental biology community, stimulate new ideas, and accelerate basic developmental
research and progress toward clinically relevant applications."
11001853,"The Rio Grande Valley Cancer Health Disparity Research Center’s (RGV-CHDRC) Administrative Core (ADC)
is designed for the effective management of the day-to-day fiscal, personnel, infrastructure, and productivity of
the proposed RCMI center in a seamless and cohesive manner. ADC will foster and promote research
collaborations and core facilities, create a conducive research environment, engage community partners, and
facilitate career enhancement activities for post-doctoral fellows and junior investigators. We anticipate that these
activities will be crucial for developing successful intervention strategies to eliminate cancer and its associated
chronic diseases and health disparities in the Rio Grande Valley (RGV). This core will bring together RCMI center
leaders for effective implementation of the center's strategic plan. All administrative and center activities will be
monitored and evaluated by the internal and external advisory board (IAB and EAB) members to maximize
efficiency, ensure the center is aligned with the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV) and National
Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) policies and follow RCMI’s Coordinating Centers
assessment procedures. For effective management, ADC will consist of the Multiple Principal investigators
(MPI’s), a Program Director (PD) and staff including a Senior Administrative Analyst (SAA), Program
Coordinator, and Evaluator Dr. Javier Cavazos. Members of ADC will meet monthly to review the center’s
progress, implement policy/procedures, identify ongoing issues, and provide effective resolutions. This team will
also coordinate with the Office of Sponsored Programs, Contract and Grants, purchasing, travel, community
liaisons, academic/administrative offices, the NIMHD program directors and the RCMI Coordinating Center. For
the successful implementation ADC proposes the following aims: 1) Establish a communication and
infrastructure platform for health disparity research; 2) Bring together health researchers from a variety of
disciplines to work together to develop cutting-edge, transdisciplinary biomedical research; 3) Provide leadership
to ensure all milestones and goals are met in a timely manner; 4) Facilitate engagement of researchers through
core facilities and promote career enhancement activities/training programs and scholarly activities; and 5)
Evaluate center activities to ensure that all milestones are reached in a meaningful and timely manner. We
believe that these activities will position our RCMI center as one of the key resources for highlighting RGV health
disparity research, for the recruitment of new/established health disparity investigators and the development of
the minority workforce in the health disparity research. Our proposed RCMI application has potential to reduce
cancer and chronic diseases health disparities that exist among minority populations by defining novel biological,
environmental and confounding socio-behavioral factors and develop a health disparity research workforce."

Myocardial infarction (MI) and the resulting left ventricular remodeling may compromise cardiac function and
eventually result in heart failure. Although there are limited current treatment options for these patients beyond
re-perfusion, a number of biomaterial therapies are currently being developed and have even progressed to
clinical trials. Our lab with our clinical collaborators have been exploring the use of injectable hydrogels for over
a decade to provide both mechanical and biological signals to the heart during the acute phase of MI, to alter
the LV remodeling response and to improve cardiac function. Often, these hydrogels are delivered as a
“pocket” of material within the myocardium with initial cell interactions only at the hydrogel periphery; however,
we now look to design “active” strategies where the material design can guide tissue repair through porosity
and engineered hydrogel signals. To accomplish this, we propose the development and application of granular
hydrogels – comprised of assembled microgel subunits that exhibit shear-thinning properties for injectability
and inherent interstitial porosity for cell invasion. Our guiding hypothesis is that the injection of granular
hydrogels will permit cellular invasion to increase vascular density, matrix accumulation, and improve
functional outcomes after MI. Importantly, particle-based materials are also known to promote a pro-healing
response based on their structure, leading to early collagen deposition, which can be leveraged to promote
infarct stabilization. Due to the modular nature of granular hydrogels, we propose three Aims to better
understand their structure-function properties towards their translation as an MI therapy. In Aim 1, we fabricate
microgels with high-throughput microfluidic approaches to form granular hydrogels where biophysical features,
namely particle size and the introduction of inter-particle interactions, are altered. We explore how these
parameters influence cell invasion, the maturation of vascular structures, and improve cardiac function when
assessed in an ischemia-reperfusion MI model in rodents. In Aim 2, we then seek to understand how the
addition of biochemical signals in granular hydrogels, including the protease-degradation of select microgel
populations and local release of the chemoattractant stromal cell derived factor 1α further improve outcomes.
Lastly, in Aim 3, we look towards translation with the development of advanced microfluidics for the rapid
fabrication of granular hydrogels and then evaluate select compositions in a clinically-relevant ischemia-
reperfusion model in pigs. Our study is supported by extensive preliminary work and expertise, including
biomaterials development for cardiac repair (Burdick), microfluidic design for particle fabrication and scale-up
(Issadore), and animal models for the assessment of therapies for MI (Atluri/Gorman). The significance of
this work is potentially profound, as it develops an acellular injectable hydrogel treatment for MI by
recruiting endogenous cell populations in the early post-MI period to limit adverse LV remodeling."
11007110,"PROJECT SUMMARY - ABSTRACT
Cell-cell interactions drive many of today’s most challenging diseases like cancer, autoimmunity, and
neurological disease. Studying cell-cell interactions is challenging because the cells are alive and remain motile,
and the complexity of downstream analysis increases with every observed interaction event. Today, researchers
study cell-cell interactions using invasive perturbation methods (e.g. CRISPR) or commercial spatial approaches
on FFPE or FF dead tissue samples. While these approaches have their merits, the field would benefit from a
non-invasive, easy-to-use method for live cell identification and on-demand tagging at scale. This proposal aims
to derisk the core elements of a prototype instrument, software, and consumable developed for on-the-fly cell
identification, tagging, and downstream characterization. The live-cell-in, live-cell-out process allows applications
like live cell assays, further cell engineering, and new depths of multiomics discovery not possible with today’s
spatial approaches. The platform will be tested in an end-user’s hands toward the clinically relevant study of the
effects of antigen presentation on T-cell activation. At the core of the proposed application is the tenet that a
better understanding of cell-cell interactions will expose important underlying biological pathways, thereby
increasing targets for therapeutic intervention."

From 2020 to 2030, the US will need to fill a total of 7.9 million direct care job openings, from both new and
existing vacancies, due to workers leaving the industry (PHI, 2023). This direct care shortage is directly
propelled by the growing number of older adults, increased longevity of patients, and lack of workforce
licensing support. Many of the direct care jobs are filled by Certified Nurse Assistants (CNA), who identify
largely as low income and/or ethnic minorities. As this gap between the demand for direct care workers and
available, licensed direct care workers widens, the same communities that CNAs stem from will be the first to
suffer from the negative health effects caused by the lack of access to qualified, diverse CNAs. To ensure
CNAs can legally continue to provide care, we must create infrastructure that can reduce turnover caused by
laborious licensing demands and support its growth. Suma, a California-based small business, has developed
a software as a service that reduces licensing compliance burdens and streamlines requirements into an
accessible online management system. Although preliminary studies have shown Suma’s ability to help CNAs
manage renewal requirements and lead to an increased workforce retention, additional structure is needed to
support the lion’s share of CNAs that lack access to resources. In Phase I, Suma will develop SumaAdmin,
which will integrate employers in the CNA licensing system to provide additional infrastructure that elevates
and supports CNA leading to a decrease in licensing dropout. Aim 1: Develop a prototype of SumaAdmin
which will enable LTC facilities to dynamically manage employed, licensed BIPOC and lower SES CNAs. Aim
2: Conduct closed alpha testing with BIPOC CNAs of SumaAdmin product to identify usability challenges and
bugs, flag structural/functionality issues, and test user mapping. Aim 3: Pilot closed beta testing of prototype
with 40 BIPOC, ESL, and/or lower SES CNAs and rural LTC facility partner. This feasibility and usability test
will include successful mastery of essential intervention skills plus satisfaction ratings. Upon completion of
Phase I, Suma will have developed a prototype of SumaAdmin, have tested it in a long-term care facility
environment, received feedback on the software from end users, and documented its impact of CNA licensing
turnover. This will allow transition to a Phase II which will focus on conducting a long-term study of SumaAdmin
across various healthcare facilities and communities throughout the state of California. Given the growing
demand for direct care workers, there is a significant commercialization opportunity in creating a licensing
support ecosystem that encourages workforce retention. Investing in this technological innovation will lead to
more equitable access to care and increase quality of life across the lifespan."
11006769,"ABSTRACT
There is a fundamental gap in our current understanding of how Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) causes
disease in the human lung, and several reasons are responsible for this lack of knowledge. Firstly, the availability
of tuberculous human lung tissues plummeted with the introduction of antibiotics in the 1940s and 1950s.
Secondly, TB research using animals rapidly progressed and novel technologies were applied to these model
systems. However, it is well known that no animal model reproduces the full spectrum of disease as it occurs in
humans, or naturally mediates transmission to new hosts. Not surprisingly, interest in human pulmonary TB was
revived decades later when it was realized that the disease had never been eradicated. Despite this, there are
few studies focused on elucidating the fundamental mechanisms of active, subclinical, and latent human TB,
which is likely due to limited access to human TB lung tissue. We believe the TB field can no longer rely on
animal models that yield findings of limited clinical relevance. Thus, there is an urgent need to better understand
human pulmonary TB in order to develop clinically relevant therapeutic strategies. The overall goal of this R24
proposal is to transform the global landscape of TB research by accelerating the study of human TB tissue. We
will accomplish this by providing user-requested services comprised of two components: (i) the pathological,
cellular, structural, and/or genetic analysis of resected human TB or postmortem (PM) tissue and (ii), the
dissemination of tissue to the global TB research community. We have several unique advantages since AHRI,
located in Durban, South Africa, has access to a continuously growing collection of active TB/HIV and PM
samples, including entire lungs/lobes. This R24 proposal is built upon substantial published data from our group
that clearly demonstrate our capacity to examine resected and PM lung tissue from Mtb/HIV-infected human
subjects. The rationale for this proposal are (i) that by providing this dedicated service to the TB research
community, numerous laboratories worldwide will be able to rapidly ascertain the clinical relevance of their basic
science discoveries, which will help refine the focus of their research to have translational impact, and (ii) our
services will drive the discovery of new human TB paradigms, or challenge existing paradigms, ultimately leading
to the development of clinically relevant diagnostics, anti-TB drugs, and/or vaccines. This proposal is significant
because it is the first step in a progression of innovative services to the global TB research community that is
expected to bolster and accelerate translational and clinical research to expedite the discovery of innovative new
strategies to improve diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of TB."

The goal of this project is to assess the role of cost-associated barriers to new and future novel
AD/ADRD therapeutics in Hispanic or Latino older adults. Our work in the first (planning) phase
of the project will include semi-structured interviews with a cohort of Latino adults created as
part of the team’s ongoing work on diversity in clinical trials and an existing group of Latino
patients with AD/ADRD and their caregivers. The interviews will inform a subsequent
population-based survey to be fielded in the Understanding America Study, an online panel
study housed at the University of Southern California. Both the interviews and the survey will
elucidate cost and non-cost barriers to the use of new novel dementia therapeutics. The survey
will more fully and systematically capture the contribution of environmental, sociocultural,
behavioral, and biological factors to the demand for and use of these new medications for older
Hispanic adults and relative to non-Hispanic adults. The second, implementation stage of our
work will analyze existing Medicare claims and Encounter data to understand real world use
patterns. We will then use the team’s well-established dynamic microsimulation to estimate the
downstream impacts of use on cognitive and physical health, costs, and quality of life of older
Hispanic or Latino adults with dementia. The dynamic microsimulation model will be informed by
the work conducted in all other parts of the project both in terms of parameter inputs and
simulated scenarios."

broader ComPASS program to provide thematic technical assistance across food/nutrition security,
intergenerational family interventions, poverty-reduction, cultural resilience, and participatory research and
implementation approaches. These thematic areas represent the extensive expertise of the team and address
challenges encountered in diverse settings throughout the U.S. The Yale ComPASS Hub has the capacity to
expand the breath of technical assistance thematic areas as CHESI needs are identified. The Yale ComPASS
Hub will use community-academic partnerships to tailor and deliver responsive, accessible, and
transformational technical assistance to CHESIs as they generate new scientific knowledge about community-
led structural interventions to advance health equity. The overall aim of the Yale ComPASS Hub is to provide
evidence-derived technical assistance and capacity-building support to CHESIs based on collaborative
processes and practical guidance adapted by partnered academic and community leader Hub unit teams. Hub
units will each be co-led by Academic and Community Director teams with almost two decades of experience
working collaboratively on health equity-related research or practice initiatives. The Yale ComPASS Hub will
elevate the role of partnered research and decision-making in grant governance and implementation, bring
diverse methodological and analytical research expertise to facilitate transdisciplinary collaboration,
meaningfully engage community members to more equitably partner in co-creation and implementation of
research, and elevate the science of community engaged research to drive health equity."
10977171,"Caused by advanced cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) leaves survivors
with a very high risk of incident vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). While aggressive blood
pressure (BP) reduction can reduce the risk of VCID and recurrent stroke, more than 50% of ICH survivors have
BP above target, particularly individuals with adverse social determinants of health (SDOH). The parent study,
REACH-ICH (R01NS093870), will fill gaps in our knowledge about the role of SDOH after ICH by identifying
SDOH-induced environmental risk factors that impact a) VCID after ICH, b) BP treatment resistance, and c)
engagement with a program designed to improve treatment of BP. 700 ICH survivors are currently being enrolled
through REACH-ICH at multiple centers, divided among White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian participants.
Participants are screened with an extensive battery for SDOH exposures, and are followed longitudinally for BP
treatment response, cognitive decline, and recurrent stroke. 607 of the participants will receive genome-wide
genotyping under the award.
 Additional analyses building on the REACH-ICH infrastructure could yield biological mechanisms induced by
adverse SDOH environments that could be amenable to therapeutic development, at a fraction of the cost of a
standalone study. This proposed project, REACH-EpiVCID, will examine epigenetic mediators between SDOH
exposures and adverse cognitive outcomes after ICH, as well as BP treatment resistance. Epigenetic changes
have already been identified in association with environmental exposures such as air pollution, and have
established associations in cardiovascular disease. We will extend these observations to a cohort heavily
enriched for CSVD and with an historically high burden of adverse SDOH exposures. REACH-EpiVCID will a)
identify epigenetic changes associated with environmental differences induced by SDOH, b) identify epigenetic
changes associated with incident VCID and BP treatment resistance after ICH, and c) combine epigenetic
associations with DNA genotypes to perform formal mediation analyses and causal inference testing via
Mendelian randomization. Epigenetic changes and the mechanistic pathways they highlight are potentially
modifiable by small molecules or by behavioral change, and so putative causal associations mediating the effect
of SDOH on VCID will represent highly relevant candidates for development of novel treatments to prevent VCID
and improve BP treatment resistance after ICH. Further, because epigenetic mediators between SDOH and
VCID are likely to be initiated by adverse environmental exposures, treatment targets arising from this approach
stand to have the greatest benefits in marginalized populations at greatest risk for these exposures, promoting
health equity through biologically informed treatments as strategies to ameliorate the structural contributors to
SDOH continue to evolve with time."

Metabolic relationships between retina and RPE are essential for retina function and survival.
Biochemical comparisons of explanted retina to RPE/choroid have revealed striking metabolic
differences. Retinas consume glucose rapidly and convert most of it to lactate. Cultured RPE
cells and RPE/choroid consume glucose more slowly than retinas. RPE/choroid tissue can
oxidize many types of fuels as an alternative to glucose. We proposed that retina and
RPE/choroid function synergistically as a “metabolic ecosystem”. RPE/choroid minimizes its
own consumption of glucose so more glucose can be delivered to the retina.
The simple model we proposed was based on measurements of energy metabolism in cultured
cells or in retinal or RPE/choroid explants. Those types of experiments do not prove that these
types of metabolic interactions occur in the eye of a living animal. The experiments in this
proposal test this idea more directly and more rigorously. We will measure metabolic flux in
tissue explants and we will measure it in living mice in which 13C labeled fuels are delivered via
a jugular vein catheter. We will use retinas and RPE/choroid from mice in which genes encoding
specific enzymes required for metabolism have been disrupted. Our 1st aim is to Identify
biochemical changes in degenerated retinas that cause glycolytic intermediates upstream of
pyruvate kinase to accumulate. For our 2nd aim we collaborate with other labs that have
generated mice with mutations that disrupt specific metabolic activities in retinas. Our 3rd aim is
to analyze changes in metabolic interactions caused by disrupted RPE metabolism. Aim 4 will
complete metabolic analyses of mouse models with metabolic changes designed to slow
degeneration of photoreceptors by enhancing glycolysis in rods and by suppressing it in RPE.
Our findings will help the vision community recognize therapeutic strategies that may
succesfully treat multiple types of retinal degenerations."
10976825,"Burnout among Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs) is a growing public health crisis with recent
estimates as high as 72%. As CRNAs are the predominant anesthesia providers in 80% of rural counties
across the United States (US), and with rural residents notably an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
(AHRQ) priority population, mitigating CRNA burnout and preventing its adverse sequalae (i.e., job
dissatisfaction, intention to leave one’s primary position) is critical to ensure an ample supply of CRNAs to
meet the demand for surgical and anesthesia care. A paucity of literature exists exploring organizational
factors contributing to CRNA burnout. Organizational climate (i.e., interprofessional relations, workload,
autonomy, and administrative support) conceptualizes the structural and process factors within an organization
and has been shown to impact burnout, job satisfaction, and intention to leave. However, no study to date has
explored these associations in the CRNA population. CRNAs provide high-quality, equitable, and cost-effective
anesthesia care for rural populations, which makes clear the need to identify organizational factors that support
their wellbeing and retention. The proposed study will investigate, for the first time, the impact of organizational
climate on burnout, job satisfaction, and intention to leave among CRNAs employed in rural settings using a
mixed-methods approach. The project’s specific aims are: Aim 1. To examine whether CRNA organizational
climate (CRNA-Organizational Climate Questionnaire) is associated with burnout (Maslach Burnout
Inventory), job satisfaction (single validated item), and intention to leave (single validated item) among
CRNAs in rural settings. We hypothesize that poor organizational climate will be associated with increased
CRNA burnout, decreased job satisfaction, and increased intention to leave primary position. We will collect
cross-sectional survey data from an estimated sample of 219 CRNAs employed in rural settings in California,
New York, and Texas (to study varying state scope of practice regulations) and build multi-level regression
models to determine associations. Exploratory Aim. Explore whether CRNA organizational climate moderates
the associations between state scope of practice regulations and burnout, job satisfaction, and intention to
leave for CRNAs in rural settings. Aim 2. Understand the CRNA perspectives of organizational climate
factors related to burnout, job satisfaction, and intention to leave in rural settings. We will bolster survey
findings using 1:1 qualitative interviews with 10-16 CRNAs until data saturation is reached. The robust
research infrastructure at Columbia University, coupled with the guidance of an exceptional mentorship team,
experts in rural workforce policy, organizational climate, and multilevel modelling, will provide the support to
achieve these aims. The evidence generated in this proposal, aligned with AHRQ’s mission, may
optimize workforce policy and identify interventions aimed at reducing CRNA burnout and turnover to
ensure access to high-quality, safe, affordable surgical and anesthesia care for rural residents."
10993850,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), delaying initiation of treatment for ≥12 weeks is associated with irreversible joint
damage due to greater difficulty in achieving remission, but navigating the hurdles of the US healthcare system
in this short timeframe can be challenging. Time-consuming logistical steps must be carried out to be evaluated
by a qualified specialist, establish a diagnosis, and start antirheumatic drug therapy. These difficulties are
exacerbated for rural residents due to the closure of rural hospitals nationwide extending the distance to
healthcare facilities and the time to travel and obtain care. Additionally, there is very little information about the
timing and accuracy of RA diagnosis and their associated effects on outcomes for rural residents of the US. The
growing rheumatology workforce shortage further aggravates these issues, as <10% of rheumatologists practice
in rural or micropolitan areas yet 30% of the US population lives in these areas. Our goal is to improve outcomes
in patients with RA by reducing healthcare disparities. We aim to (1) identify rural healthcare disparities in the
diagnosis and treatment of early RA, (2) develop and validate an AI algorithm to enable early identification of
RA, and (3) assess long-term outcomes in patients with RA living in rural vs urban areas compared to those
without RA.
We are uniquely positioned to address these objectives as ours is the only population-based, longitudinal RA
inception cohort in the US, and we will extend our cohort to the expanded Rochester Epidemiology Project
catchment area, comprising 27 mixed rural-urban counties in MN and WI (60% rural). This area includes 73 rural
communities where 17 medical facilities have closed in the past 5 years. In addition, we have the only well-
curated database of patients with incident RA, as we manually screen all potential cases of RA to ensure they
meet the American College of Rheumatology/ European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology
(ACR/EULAR) classification criteria for RA. This is essential for RA research because the diagnostic codes for
RA (especially seronegative RA) are often inaccurate. This research will provide real-world evidence regarding
the magnitude of healthcare disparities in rural residents with RA. Our AI algorithm to facilitate early recognition
of RA will improve clinical practice in three meaningful ways, 1) reducing underdiagnosis of RA in rural primary
care settings, 2) facilitating timely initiation of anti-rheumatic therapies to reduce joint damage and improve long-
term outcomes, and 3) optimizing referrals to rheumatology specialty care to reduce the impact of the workforce
shortage. This work will be foundational for the development of a pragmatic clinical trial testing implementation
of a clinical decision support tool to reduce disparities in early identification of RA. Furthermore, evaluating long-
term outcomes and identifying patient subgroups with the worst outcomes is an important step toward developing
interventions to bridge these gaps in healthcare delivery."

 Opioid use disorder is defined as chronic, maladaptive opioid use despite negative consequences.
Prolonged opioid exposure can induce long-lasting changes to neural circuitry involved with reward and
motivation, leading to drug cravings and tolerance to the drug’s rewarding effects over time. One brain region
known to play a key role in opioid reward processing is the nucleus accumbens, which contains two
subpopulations of GABAergic medium spiny neurons that express either the D1 or D2 dopamine receptor, as
well as a variety of interneuron cell types and glia. Medium spiny neurons project to multiple brain regions, and
µ-opioid receptors are also expressed on many neurons throughout the brain. Thus, it is reasonable to predict
that chronic opioid exposure will be associated with global alterations in neuronal activity patterns. Improving
our understanding of both the molecular and circuit-level mechanisms underlying opioid use disorder is crucial
to facilitating the development of more effective treatments.
 To address this gap in knowledge, I plan to leverage a rodent model of chronic, voluntary oral fentanyl
intake that I have developed and implemented. My goal for this training proposal is to use this paradigm to
specifically assess what changes occur to gene expression and neural circuitry over periods of sustained
opioid self-administration. In Aim 1, we plan to conduct single nuclei RNAseq in the nucleus accumbens of
mice after chronic fentanyl intake and withdrawal. Aim 2 will utilize transgenic mice to visualize expression of
the early immediate gene cFOS, a marker of neuron activity. Whole-brain clearing and light-sheet microscopy
will be used to quantify the neural activation patterns associated with long-term fentanyl escalation and
withdrawal. Together, these aims will lead to a more complete understanding of the impact of chronic opioid
exposure, which may inform the development of novel therapeutic interventions for opioid use disorder."

ABSTRACT OF FUNDED GRANT
 Cardiac injury predisposes patients to heart failure (HF), and ventricular
tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF). Development of HF and VT/VF after cardiac injury is tightly
linked to sympathetic neural remodeling. Although several medications targeting cardiac
sympathetic excess reduce mortality following cardiac injury, significant shortcomings of these
drugs include off-target effects, limited efficacy, and focus on downstream consequences of
neural remodeling such as excess catecholamine release, rather than preventing it upstream. In
this proposal, we build on strong preliminary data from humans, porcine, and murine models
demonstrating that satellite glial cell (SGC) activation is a central feature of chronic cardiac
injury. Activated glia release inflammatory cytokines, ATP, and other factors that modulate
neuronal function. Chemogenetic upregulation of glial calcium signaling (as observed in
activated glia) increase cardiac sympathetic neuronal excitability, synaptic efficacy, and tonic
firing. Based on these novel findings, the goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that
satellite glial activation and enhanced glial-neuronal signaling is a primary driver of cardiac
sympathetic neuronal dysfunction, HF and VT/VF after cardiac injury. We will test our
hypotheses using novel tools from a multidisciplinary team of investigators in 3 specific aims in
two murine models of cardiac injury (ischemia-reperfusion and dilated cardiomyopathy). We will
test whether following cardiac injury, satellite glial cell activation within stellate ganglia
exacerbates neuronal and cardiac remodeling (structural and functional) to promote LV
dysfunction and VT/VF (Aim 1). We will investigate the mechanisms by which cardiac injury
activates SGCs in stellate ganglia after injury (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine whether
targeting glial Gq-GPCR Ca2+ signaling or Cx43-mediated glia-neuron/glial- glial
communication mitigates adverse remodeling and arrhythmogenesis following cardiac injury
(Aim 3). The results of this proposal will 1) indicate whether and how satellite glial cell activation
contributes to sympathetic imbalance after cardiac injury; and 2) determine whether targeting
satellite glial cell activation offers therapeutic potential in chronic cardiac injury."
11003568,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
An alarming increase in the rate of opioid abuse among the general population has resulted in a public health
emergency since 2017. The striking rise in opioid use disorder has affected Americans broadly, including steady
increases in adolescent deaths due to opioid overdose. However, a number of barriers exist for adolescents to
gain access to treatment; and current approaches to pharmacotherapy rely on the off-label use of opioids and
other agents used in adults with OUD.
Through a successful collaboration with NIDA, USWM developed lofexidine for the mitigation of opioid withdrawal
symptoms in adults. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved lofexidine tablets (LUCEMYRA®) for
this indication in May 2018. Due to the anticipated utility of lofexidine for the treatment of opioid withdrawal in
children, USWM has completed all nonclinical prerequisites necessary to initiate studies in adolescents and
engaged with FDA to confirm the approach to registration.
The goal of this project is to further NIDA-USWM collaboration to complete FDA development requirements for
the approval of Lucemyra in adolescents. The use of an approved medication for opioid withdrawal will provide
needed safe and effective treatment options for this underserved patient population to optimize opportunities for
initial engagement in treatment and transition to longer term maintenance treatment options, including
buprenorphine and extended-release naltrexone, recommended in current guidelines. The proposed research
leverages an efficient regulatory pathway using a full extrapolation approach wherein pharmacokinetic (PK)
modeling can bridge established adult efficacy to adolescents through lofexidine exposure matching. The
approach requires a PK study in adolescents experiencing acute opioid withdrawal to identify Lucemyra doses
producing exposures associated with efficacy in adults, and an open label safety study to provide adequate
safety data in support of registration requirements. Key components of the program include: i) completion of a
Phase 1 PK in adolescents to complete efficacy requirements through exposure matching pediatric extrapolation
principles (UG3 Aims 1, 2) and completion of a formal FDA meeting to confirm the remaining scope of the
development program (UG3 Key go/no go Milestone), and ii) completion of a Phase 2 open label safety study
which, together with the initial Phase 1 study, can be integrated to satisfy the safety package requirements for a
supplemental new drug application (UG3 Aim 3, UH3 Aims 1 & 3)."
11005242,"ABSTRACT
 We are proposing to develop a multiplexed point-of-care anti-factor Xa (anti-Xa) and hemoglobin test to
guide emergent management of bleeding and strokes in patients on anti-Xa direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs).
This includes guiding appropriate treatment with andexanet alfa (andexanet, tradename ANDEXXA) during
bleeds or thrombolytics for acute ischemic stroke (AIS). In this Direct-to-Phase II (D2P2) effort, we will
leverage our proprietary CE-marked FXa fluorogenic substrate and our rHEALTH point-of-care device
and app to develop a point-of-care (POC) test that yields results for both drug-specific anti-Xa activity
and hemoglobin. The CLIA-waivable approach will feature a 5-minute turnaround time, from sample collection
to result, delivering results 10x faster than any current STAT central lab test. This would lead to quicker delivery
of life-saving interventions. Currently about 16 million individuals are on direct oral anticoagulants, predominantly
for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, and ~500,000 per year are hospitalized with bleeds or breakthrough strokes.
Proper therapeutic treatment require emergent and rapid measurement of anti-Xa activity.
 In preliminary Phase I-like work, we have developed three innovations: (1) an ultra-rapid anti-Xa
assay based on our CE-marked FXa substrate, (2) a 5-minute sample-to-answer 4D microfluidic cartridge
that carries out sequential steps of our anti-Xa assay, and (3) an app-connected point-of-care device that
returns both the anti-Xa and hemoglobin values for venous or capillary blood samples. Here we propose
to leverage this work to develop a system that will rigorously test thousands of cartridges across three aims: (1)
Assess accuracy and precision of all consumable steps and improve robustness where needed, (2) Assess
performance of various anti-Xa drugs on spiked whole blood samples and develop drug-specific controls and
calibrators, and (3) Characterize the integrated anti-Xa monitoring device, app, and consumable for analytical
precision, interferences, ranges, and limit of detection. Upon completion of this D2P2, we will commence a 510k
clinical validation study, as required for FDA clearance.
 The success of developing a 5-minute anti-Xa test will allow for 10x faster responses to guide emergency
management of patients and bring a much-needed capability to the point-of-care. A patient’s presenting anti-Xa
drug levels can vary widely, based on their peak and trough timing, drug dosage, drug clearance rate, and
bioavailability. A 5-minute anti-Xa test allows guiding immediate management and timely follow-on
measurements to allow tailored therapy. The rapid and cost-effective nature of the device will allow its use in
ambulances, emergency rooms, and surgical suites. The simultaneous reporting of hemoglobin gives treating
clinicians immediate information about the status of blood loss in the event of bleeding. The results of our efforts
will be a rapid, cost-effective, monitoring device, consumable, app, and controls that will provide an urgently
needed resource in light of recent developments in anti-Xa therapies."
11005186,"Precision Epigenomics Inc, is a University of Arizona Cancer Center and Department of
Pathology, spin out, aiming to launch molecular diagnostic tests for cancer patients. The product
of this SBIR is Sentinel-MPE liquid biopsy assay, which is a multi-cancer detection test. Our
Sentinel-MPE test can identify over twenty different cancer types. Here, we apply the Sentinel-
MPE test to the differential diagnosis of pleural effusions. In clinical practice, it remains a
challenge to distinguish between malignant pleural effusion (MPE) and benign pleural effusion
(BPE). Cytology remains the gold standard for the detection of malignant cells in pleural effusion.
However, its sensitivity is limited. Because of the limitations of conventional cytology methods,
there is an urgent need to develop a more accurate and effective method for the efficient diagnosis
of MPE. In collaboration with the University of Arizona, Precision Epigenomics has generated
significant feasibility and clinical utility data using pleural effusion. Our pilot studies indicate that
our Sentinel-MPE test has the potential to be an effective complimentary tool for cytology in the
process of differential diagnosis. The aim of this project is to conduct a multi-site clinical validation
study to establish the Sentinel-MPE test as a new commercial molecular test for the diagnosis of
MPE. The aims of this project are: 1) To establish the diagnostic value of the Sentinel-MPE liquid
biopsy assay to identify cancer in pleural effusion and 2) To validate the Sentinel-MPE liquid
biopsy assay for cancer detection in pleural effusion. The long-term goal of this project is to bring
the field of pathology a new diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of malignant pleural effusions."
11006909,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Surgical tumor resection is the first-line therapy for many types of cancers. For some cancer types, residual
cancer cells frequently remain in the tumor margin after surgery, resulting in local tumor recurrence. We
developed technology that enables the delivery of a large chemotherapy dose to the surgical cavity
immediately after surgical tumor excision. The purpose of this delivery is to kill cancer cells remaining after
surgery and eliminate local recurrence. Specifically, we employ thermo-sensitive liposomal nanoparticles
(TNP) encapsulating a chemotherapy agent (doxorubicin or idarubicin). The particles circulate in the blood
stream for extended duration (~hours), and rapidly release the contained agent only in a targeted region upon
hyperthermia exposure (>40 ºC). Combined with an appropriate hyperthermia device, our TNP enable the local
delivery of a ~25x higher local dose compared to the systemic administration of unencapsulated drug. The goal
of this project is development of a device that uses an infrared laser to expose the surgical cavity to optimal
temperatures for release of chemotherapy from TNP. If successful, this will enable the delivery of a large
chemotherapy dose to remnant cancer cells after surgery, preventing local tumor recurrences."
11007100,"Despite therapeutic advances outcomes are still poor for patients with most relapsed/refractory
malignancies. Recently CAR-T cell therapies have demonstrated significant potential to markedly
improve the outcomes of patients with relapsed refractory B cell and plasma cell malignancies.
Unfortunately to date, CAR-T cells have not demonstrated similar efficacy for patients with solid
tumors or other blood cancers. A major challenge for the development of CAR-T cells for these
malignancies is the paucity of targets on cancer cells that do not exhibit cell surface expression
on normal cells leading to significant toxicities that can correlate with efficacy. We recently
identified the non-classical MHC molecule, MR1, is a promising target for CAR-T cells. MR1 is
typically found in the cytoplasm in the vast majority of cells and was recently reported to traffic to
the cell surface in a wide variety of tumor cells when bound to cancer cell specific metabolites.
We validated the cell surface specific expression of MR1 protein in a wide range of malignancies
including pancreatic, prostate, brain, melanoma, breast, lung and AML. Further we developed a
CAR-T cell product that utilizes a non-traditional CAR design to enable it to be efficacious against
the low levels of cell MR1 found on the surface of tumor cells. Pilot mouse tumor studies
demonstrate the potential safety and efficacy of this approach. In this proposal we will focus on
the development of MR1 CAR-T cells for a blood cancer, AML, and a solid tumor, glioblastoma,
that both urgently need new therapeutic options. Here we will 1) Assess the cell surface
expression of MR1 in primary patient AML and glioblastoma samples and normal controls 2)
Perform mouse efficacy studies using AML and glioblastoma models and 3) Assess the safety of
MR1 CAR-T cells using mouse and in vitro models. It is hoped that this work will lead to an MR1
CAR-T cell product that can improve the outcomes of patients with cancer."
10999480,"Higher risk of neurodevelopmental delay during early childhood has been reported among infants who are HIV
exposed in utero but uninfected (iHEU) compared to their HIV unexposed counterparts, to which both HIV and
antiretroviral regimens may contribute. Similarly, iHEU have found to have altered gut microbiome composition,
with decreases in Bifidobacteria abundance, particularly B. infantis, and increased systemic inflammation during
the first year of life. Recent studies found that low abundance of gut Bifidobacteria during early life is associated
with increased risk of neurodevelopmental delay during early childhood in at-risk infants. As early life gut
microbiome is also crucial for immune maturation and development of cognitive function, the question arises
whether optimization of the gut microbiome during early life would be sufficient to decrease systemic
inflammation and improve neurodevelopment among iHEU. Dr Happel, a Senior Research Officer at the
University of Cape Town with expertise in molecular biology, microbiology and immunology and career
development needs in computational biology, biostatistics and epidemiology, will leverage an ongoing
randomized, double-blinded trial of oral B. infantis vs. placebo given during the first month of life to 200 iHEU
(R01HD109089). The trial provides rigorously collected clinical and biological data, a sample repository, and the
infrastructure to assess neurodevelopment and systemic inflammation in these iHEU to address this hypothesis.
Specific Aim 1: To compare neurodevelopment longitudinally in iHEU randomized to receive B. infantis versus
placebo in early life using the culturally adaptable Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 4th edition,
at 9 and 24 months of age.
Specific Aim 2: To compare systemic inflammation longitudinally in iHEU randomized to receive B. infantis versus
placebo in early life by measuring levels of circulating cytokines previously associated with HIV exposure and
neurodevelopment at 1 and 9 months of life by Luminex.
Specific Aim 3: To identify microbial and systemic predictors of neurodevelopment in South African infants by
integrating bacterial shotgun metagenomics, stool metabolomics, T cell phenotypes, systemic microbial
translocation (generated as part of the parent trial) and plasma cytokine data with neurodevelopmental outcome
data (generated here) using multiple data driven approaches.
The proposed project will provide critical data to design further interventions of modifiable biological domains
among iHEU that may improve neurodevelopmental health of this growing population. Findings will provide
insight into the use of early-life biomarkers as predictors of neurodevelopment during infancy that could
subsequently be exploited for diagnostic tool development to identify at-risk infants. Together, this might
ultimately result in decreased morbidity of iHEU, or of other infants whose gut microbiome was disturbed during
early life. This proposal is highly relevant for sub-Saharan Africa, where >25% of infants are HIV-exposed."
11000007,"SUMMARY
This proposal explores the hypothesis that very long chain ceramides serve as a causal mediator in the structural
and functional changes which underlie diastolic heart failure (HF). Moreover, this suggests a rare therapeutic
opportunity for diseases such as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), which have few evidence-
based therapies. The idea is predicated upon data presented herein showing that the genetic deletion of a
ceramide synthesis enzyme, dihydroceramide desaturase 1 (Des1), prevents hypertrophy and impairments in
diastolic function in 2 distinct mouse models of diastolic HF. The theory is further supported by untargeted
lipidomics from HFpEF patients, which demonstrate ceramides as the most upregulated lipids in serum.
Moreover, biopsies obtained from hearts with diastolic failure show elevated ceramides compared to control.
Cardiac-specific ablation of acid ceramidase, is sufficient to drive ceramide accumulation and diastolic
dysfunction without overt changes in systolic function. Administration of a pharmacological inhibitor of ceramide
biosynthesis to rodents preserves diastolic function and prevents fibrosis and hypertrophy, suggesting
therapeutic potential if safe, effective ceramide synthesis inhibitors are identified. We will determine if ceramides
are necessary and sufficient mediators of diastolic heart failure that can be targeted for therapeutic intervention.
We will evaluate our hypotheses through the following Aims:
• First, we will determine the effects of genetic induction or reduction of ceramides selectively in
 cardiomyocytes in mouse models of diastolic HF.
• Second, we will determine the efficacy of Des1 antagonism or ablation as a therapeutic approach for
 the treatment or prevention of diastolic HF.
• Third, we will elucidate the mechanisms linking ceramides to cardiac fibrosis and mitochondrial
 dysfunction using cells, mice, and human tissues.
Findings obtained from these studies could uncover new nutrient-sensing regulatory mechanisms that modulate
mitochondrial function, cardiomyocyte survival, fibrosis, and hypertrophy. Moreover, the translational component
of this work could propel the development of promising therapeutics for preventing or treating diastolic HF."
11000008,"PROJECT SUMMARY
One of the areas of emphasis on the NEI strategic plan is to bridge the gap between genomics and mechanisms
of disease. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness and disproportionately affects Hispanics/
Latinos (HL). DR-specific blood biomarkers and systemic treatments are not used clinically. Although research
into biomarkers and genetic variants has informed our understanding of DR, whether these signatures cause or
are caused by DR, and how genetic variants contribute to DR etiology is still not clear. Further, few of these
studies have meaningful representations of HL despite their high DR burden. Because transcript and metabolite
levels provide a window into gene function, they can help us interpret genome-wide association study (GWAS)
results to better understand complex diseases like DR. Given the growing HL population in the US and their
disproportionate cardiometabolic disease burden, HL representation in functional genomic studies of diabetic
sequelae is imperative. The Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC) is a cohort of HL with poor
cardiometabolic health and high risk for DR. Participants range between metabolically healthy and metabolically
disordered individuals without or with diabetes, some with various levels of DR. We will quantify differential
transcript (Aim 1) and metabolite (Aim 2) abundance between participants with Type 2 diabetes (T2D) with or
without clinical diagnosis of DR in CCHC and replicate our findings in the Hispanic Community Heath
Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/ SOL), an independent, extant, diverse, larger HL dataset with T2D and self-
reported DR status. Using gene regulatory and metabolite network and pathway analyses we will clarify DR
pathophysiology, inform novel blood biomarkers and drug targets for DR, and validate their temporal precedence
with DR using both cohorts. In Aim 3, we will apply two-sample Mendelian randomization and colocalization
methods to interpret known and novel transcriptomic and metabolomic biomarkers (eQTLs and mQTLs) using
results from a novel HL-specific GWAS meta-analysis and the literature. Finally, using diverse electronic health
record (EHR)-linked databases, we will perform eQTL-, mQTL-, variant-, and polygenic risk score-based
phenome wide association and enrichment studies to expand our understanding of the broader clinical comorbid
profile of, and pathogenic mechanisms shared with, DR. Our study will clarify mechanistic causes/consequences
of DR-associated expression patterns in the blood. The aims will independently inform novel diagnostic and
therapeutic systemic DR-targets and our understanding of the causality and broader clinical implications of blood
signatures dysregulated in DR. This project meets several NIH/NEI strategic goals including: 1) enhancing our
understanding of ocular epidemiology in groups under-represented in vision science; 2) enriching data capturing
molecular signatures of disease; 3) using data science to integrate cross-modality data to understand disease;
4) understanding how genomic variants affect disease; 5) identifying risk factors for ocular disease in
underserved populations to decrease visual impairment; and 6) promoting a diverse vision research workforce."

People living with HIV (PLHIV) have a persistently reduced lifespan compared to their negative counterparts
due to increased risk of metabolic co-morbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Among
women of reproductive potential, gestational weight gain (GWG) and postpartum weight retention (PPWR) are
known contributors to the onset of these metabolic co-morbidities. Early detection of pregnant women at risk of
excessive GWG and PPWR can enable early interventions that will help minimize the occurrence of these co-
morbidities in women living with HIV (WLHIV). The overarching goal of this proposal is to identify urine
metabolites that are predictive of excessive GWG and PPWR in WLHIV. Candidate: Dr. Madlala is a
Physiologist/Epidemiologist with training in molecular sciences, quantitative research methods and experience
in field research implementation in South Africa. She is applying for a five-year Fogarty Emerging Global
Leader Award to obtain the additional training, mentorship and experience required to become a leading
independent investigator capable of obtaining R-series funding. Mentoring: She has assembled an
exceptional multidisciplinary team with extensive expertise in metabolic outcomes of HIV research in sub-
Saharan Africa. Drs. Myer (University of Cape Town, (UCT)) and Jao (Northwestern University) will serve as
primary mentors providing complementary expertise on metabolic outcomes of WLHIV and clinical use of
biomarkers. Dr. Goedecke (UCT, SAMRC), co-mentor, is a Physiologist with expertise in mechanistic science
research. Dr. Kurland (Albert Einstein: expertise in metabolomics laboratory technique) and Dr. Balmert
(Northwestern University: expertise in ‘omics’ data handling and pathway analysis) will serve as scientific
advisors in these areas. Training: Specific training in biomarker discovery study design, ‘big’ data statistical
analysis and metabolic pathway elucidation – will be achieved through intensive mentored training and formal
coursework. This, combined with the experience gained through implementing her research aims, will establish
Dr. Madlala’s independent research career investigating early biomarkers of adverse metabolic health in
PLHIV. Research: The specific aims of this research are to: 1) assess whether HIV infection is associated with
differences in urine metabolite species during the first trimester of pregnancy, 2) develop risk prediction models
for (i) GWG, (ii) PPWR and (iii) postpartum adiposity using metabolites and clinical variables, and 3) elucidate
the metabolic pathways of (i) GWG, (ii) PPWR and (iii) adiposity by applying pathway/network analysis to the
prognostic metabolites identified. The results of this study will inform the development of urinary metabolite-
based screening tool for adverse weight outcomes aimed at minimizing metabolic co-morbidities in pregnant
and postpartum WLHIV. They will provide preliminary data needed to apply for an R01 to conduct a large scale
study to rigorously examine predictive biomarker profile for metabolically healthy (without co-morbidities)
versus unhealthy (with co-morbidities) excessive GWG and PPWR."

The current state of science in Chinese American (CA) adolescent mental health service use is remarkably
inadequate. This proposal aims to culturally adapt and pilot test an online, culturally appropriate intervention to
improve mental health help-seeking among CA adolescents and parents.
The Specific Aims of the proposed research are:
 Aim 1: Culturally adapt evidence-based practices (EBPs) for an online intervention protocol to reduce
MH stigma and improve MH service use in CA adolescents and parents.
 Aim 2: Determine the feasibility of conducting a trial to evaluate the impact of the intervention on initiation
and sustained utilization of MH services in adolescents with newly screened to have affective disorders,
comparing it to a control group receiving only service referrals.
 Aim 3: Examine the experiences and perspectives of both CA parents and adolescents who participated
in online anti-stigma protocol as well intervention facilitators to evaluate its acceptability.
The proposed research is significant and innovative in multiple ways. First, we focus on CA adolescents, an
extremely understudied minority population in health services research. A portfolio review of clinical research
funded by the NIH from 1992 to 2018 revealed that only 0.17% of the total NIH budget was directed to studies
on Asian American — including CA — populations. Second, our focus will be on intervening on risk and protective
mechanisms through a culturally sensitive lens. Therefore, the proposed research is highly relevant to NIH's
focus on understanding modifiable factors to inform interventions. Lastly, this study will be carried out by the PI
and a research team with expertise in mental health services research, intervention development, and treatment
of MH problems among CA adolescents.

1.2M people are living with HIV (PWH) in the US. With advances in antiretroviral therapy, the survival of PWH
has increased; half of PWH are over the age of 50. Given the number of older PWH is steadily increasing, this
has become a new population of interest in aging research. Older PWH face a 60% increased risk of dementia
with different risk profiles for neurological disorders compared to the general population. Specifically, disparities
in dementia diagnoses and care are deeply rooted in social determinants of health (SDoH), yet, the dementia
risk in PWH has not been well-characterized considering disparities including SDoH—a growing concern in HIV-
aging research. Currently, there is no cure for dementia, thus, it is vital to develop strategies for early recognition
of dementia and provide interventions on modifiable factors early to delay its onset. Developing an early warning
system (EWS) using risk prediction models enables the detection of PWH at a high risk of dementia, supporting
timely biobehavioral interventions. However, no such EWS exists for PWH. The proliferation of real-world data
(RWD) such as electronic health records (EHRs) and claims data, leveraging artificial intelligence (AI),
particularly machine learning (ML), offers unique opportunities to generate real-world evidence (RWE) for HIV-
aging research. This proposal creates a cohort of older PWH with all-cause dementia including Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD) using a unique RWD source—OneFlorida+ network (20M
patients from Florida, Georgia, and Alabama) integrated with both individual- (e.g., education, social cohesion)
and contextual- (e.g., neighborhood characteristics) SDoH. Built upon this unique resource, our study has two
objectives: (1) examine disparities in the risk of dementia among PWH≥50 by leveraging large-scale RWD linked
with SDoH data and (2) prototype a prediction model for an EWS that identifies PWH at a high risk of dementia.
The Specific Aims are: (1) developing computable phenotypes and natural language processing methods and
tools to systematically extract key characteristics and relevant outcomes using RWD; (2) developing ML-based
prediction models and examining disparities in the risk of dementia among older PWH; and (3) applying a user-
centered design approach to prototype an EWS for detecting older PWH with high risk of dementia. Findings will
serve as the foundation for R01 submissions focused on the expansion of EWS as an AI-driven clinical decision-
support tool optimizing early detection of PWH at a high risk of dementia and the development of biobehavioral
interventions supporting the control of ‘realistically modifiable’ SDoH factors for delay of dementia onset that can
be used in PWH’s everyday life. Mentors are committed to the candidate’s training, each providing unique
expertise to the research and training plan. This K01 application, consistent with the NIA’s mission, will support
the candidate’s development as an interdisciplinary scientist with a triple background in AI, data science, and
HIV aging research, dedicated to developing data-driven approaches based on RWE for reducing disparities and
promoting healthy longevity for older PWH."

Peptides possess exceptional therapeutic qualities, with high potency, selectivity, and low toxicity.
Challenges like short half-life and poor oral bioavailability of peptides have been addressed
through innovative strategies such as unnatural amino acids, conjugates, and cyclization.
However, the complexity of peptide datasets has grown, complicating drug discovery processes.
Machine learning (ML) has shown promise, with various algorithms showcased on numerous
applications. Yet current approaches lack encodings for non-canonical amino acids (NCAAs) and
struggle with small datasets. This proposal aims to develop methods for encoding NCAAs and
cyclic peptides and demonstrate high performance machine learning on commercial
sequence/activity as well as stability and permeability datasets. In addition, methods to assess
data diversity and minimal dataset requirements will be addressed. The platform, commercialized
in a browser-based software, will empower wet lab researchers to train potency models and utilize
pre-trained solubility, stability and permeability models. This comprehensive platform is poised to
expedite development schedules by extracting valuable insights from limited datasets and
preemptively addressing development challenges through property predictions. More importantly,
this endeavor has the potential to greatly benefit patients by introducing novel synthetic peptide
treatments that are not only safe and effective but also more affordable."

Uveal melanoma (UM) is a prevalent intraocular cancer, with approximately 3,000 new cases
annually and an estimated total of 60,000-70,000 affected individuals in the US. This
malignancy poses a distressing reality as around 50% of patients develop metastatic diseases
within 5 years, leading to devastating consequences for patients and healthcare providers.
Current methods for predicting metastasis risk rely on invasive needle biopsies based on gene
expression profiles (GEP), which are performed once and can cause discomfort and
complications. The urgent need to address this challenge calls for the development of an
effective and least invasive prognostic tool that can accurately predict metastatic risk, enhance
safety, and guide treatment decisions worldwide, thereby offering better surveillance for patients
with reduced costs and alleviating their concerns.
To tackle this challenge, we've established a novel approach for predicting metastasis risk using
proteomic analysis of aqueous humor (AH), the clear fluid of the front chamber from eyes. AH
paracentesis, a safe procedure routinely performed in ophthalmology practice for decades,
enabled the identification of differentially expressed proteins in AH samples. With this STTR
Phase 1 application, we aim to develop a fit-for-purpose test based on our innovation, aiming to
provide an easy-to-use pre-clinical test that utilizes safely accessible AH-based protein
biomarkers, ultimately improving prediction accuracy and informing patient care."

Heart failure (HF) is a nationwide epidemic with over 6 million afflicted patients and 600,000 new patients
diagnosed each year. Many HF patients present with left bundle branch (LBB) block morphology and mechanical
dyssynchrony which are strong predictors of cardiovascular mortality. Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT)
has emerged as a powerful treatment for HF. Approximately 30% of patients still do not improve after therapy,
however, and improvement of the responder rate to pacing therefore remains a crucial clinical challenge. His
and Left Bundle Branch (LBB) pacing have therefore recently emerged as alternatives CRT. Left bundle pacing
and LBB pacing arguably produce a physiologically normal ventricular activation pattern, by utilizing the native
His-Purkinje system. Despite the creation of specialized pacing electrodes and sheaths, successful placement
of the His lead is achieved in ~80% of cases. Initially, time consuming mapping (and significant fluoroscopic
imaging and related radiation) must be performed to accomplish the following: 1) Locate the His signal, 2) Deliver
the lead perpendicular to the myocardial tissue to reach the His, and 3) Pace to demonstrate selective His
capture with acceptable pacing capture thresholds. Hence, the overall goal of this Phase I proposal is to use a
deployable suction flute-tipped lead placement sheath to both improve mapping the His location of the heart,
and to place the lead into the His with the lead’s orthogonal orientation. Recently, we have developed a sheath
which can deploy a suction flute within the heart. We intend to refine our design and optimize it for His targeting
and stabilization. Suction will also serve as an indicator that our flute is oriented orthogonally to the endocardium.
To build on the previous successes, this work will be accomplished by the following Specific Aims: 1) Refine
flute design to incorporate electrodes, arrayed in the rim of the flute and 2) Validate the safety and
efficacy of the His lead stabilization technology in a cohort of swine (n=6) in a chronic 4-week study. The
validated novel sheath configuration will align our deployable suction flute with a high degree of freedom for
adjustment. The successful completion of this Phase I proposal will systematically address the current
challenges of His lead placement, reducing the complexity of lead placement, while also improving placement
accuracy and long-term outcomes. A subsequent Phase II SBIR will translate this technology to the clinic for
optimization of His pacing, and a reduction in non-responder rates. This technology addresses some of the
shortcomings of CRT that requires three lead placements including one in the coronary sinus which is often
difficult and may require substantial fluoroscopy time. In addition to improved outcome, there is an opportunity
to reduce the healthcare cost of the treatment of HF epidemic."
11009894,"Plague, an emerging infectious disease endemic to multiple continents, including North 
and South America, is a top priority in national biodefense. Studying pathogenic yersiniae, the 
bacteria responsible for plague, provides valuable insights into pathogenesis and evolution. 
Genomic sequencing of the Yersinia genus and extensive Yersinia pestis genomes spanning 
from the Bronze Age to the present offer a rich resource for this research. 
A distinct feature of plague infections is the lack of inflammation at bacterial replication 
sites. Recent studies on pneumonic plague reveal a two-phase course: a delayed inflammatory 
response followed by a highly inflammatory phase as the disease progresses. In the initial 
phase, non-human primate and mouse models show no cellular infiltration. Extracellular 
presence of Y. pestis in primate lungs does not trigger inflammation. In a rat model of bubonic 
plague, neutrophil infiltration into draining lymph nodes is delayed, and infected sites undergo 
necrosis instead of inflammation. Comparisons between Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. pestis 
infections demonstrate neutrophil recruitment but inadequate containment of the infection. 
Research on the type III secretion system and other virulence factors has explored their role in 
neutralizing early inflammatory responses. However, understanding macrophage polarization 
during early plague stages remains incomplete. A central hypothesis suggests that Y. pestis 
prevents inflammation by inhibiting M1 polarization or inducing M2 macrophages Investigating 
these mechanisms will enhance knowledge of how macrophage polarization contributes to early 
immune suppression in plague, preventing the infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes 
(PMNs) and promoting the initial anti-inflammatory stage of plague. 
Aim 1. Investigate macrophage polarization after Yersinia pestis exposure to block 
inflammation by either inhibiting M1 polarization or inducing M2 macrophages. 
Aim 2. Determine signaling pathways induced and mechanisms used by Y. pestis to 
influence macrophage polarization.

Targeting biologically relevant tau monomers and oligomers using a novel DEL drug
discovery platform to treat Alzheimer’s disease and tauopathies
This Phase I SBIR project aims at the identification using our novel DNA-encoded library (DEL) drug discovery
platform of small molecular weight compounds that can bind to the protein monomeric and/or oligomeric tau
and modify its biology, ultimately blocking or reducing its toxicity. A number of neurodegenerative diseases
such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and sporadic frontotemporal dementias (e.g., Pick’s disease), are called
tauopathies because of the abnormal intracellular inclusions highly enriched in tau protein that characterize
them. These inclusions or neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are believed to be the result of pathological misfolding
of tau due to hyperphosphorylation and leading to oligomerization, fibrillization and involving spreading of
soluble tau oligomers. Those facts together with the progression with age of tau pathology and the difficulty to
target Aβ peptide oligomers make the identification of tau pathology inhibitors highly relevant and urgently
needed for AD and all tauopathies in general. Tau drug discovery is hampered by the need of large amounts of
mostly non-physiological tau protein (E. coli) for high-throughput screening (HTS), the need to use elaborated
tau systems that are not HTS compatible to recapitulate tau biology, and the need for a clear tau biological
activity to perform HTS drug screening. Our research strategy is to remove those limitations and identify tau
binders using a DEL screening approach that will allow small amounts of a physiological/high quality protein
target to be used with very large screening power (125 million entirely new proprietary compounds) and a
binding-based assay that is activity-independent. The central hypothesis is that due to the very large number of
compounds available to be tested and the inherent diversity, it will be possible to identify efficiently, in a cost-
effective way, compounds that are high-affinity binders of tau oligomers and possibly protofibrils. DEL
screening protocols have been generated and optimized focusing on minimizing the amount of protein tau to
be used and on purifying tau from mammalian cells. These steps will ensure that a physiological tau version is
used for screening and validation purposes. Screen duplicates used are increasing confidence and improve
hits’ heuristic values determination. Aim 1 will be dedicated to finalizing DEL screening campaigns with
monomeric tau. Tau will be expressed in mammalian cells, purified, aggregated, and immobilized on beads.
Aim 1 will generate a list of 24-36 hits binding to monomeric tau and not found for oligomeric tau; specificity
will be investigated. Physical binding of all candidate hits identified (up to 100) will be validated with two
different methods. Aim 2 will include chemical synthesis of 18 additional new hits and intermediaries, structure
activity relationship studies and in-silico docking. Importantly, Aim 2 will help identifying hit candidates that can
affect tau’s biology and especially oligomerization and seeding. Altogether, this proposal will generate 3-5
compounds with 3-digit nanomolar range KD or lower and will represent a strong proof of concept fully
validating Phase I and a robust starting point to initiate Phase II."

The development of cell and gene therapies like Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cells has necessitated new
technologies that can monitor the biodistribution and trafficking pattern of these therapies in human patients.
Imaging is particularly well suited to provide quantitative measurements of such therapies over time. Vellum
Biosciences is a platform imaging company geared to fill this void in available technologies, providing repeatable,
robust, and sensitive measures of genetic medicine in situ with clear applications in new drug development,
clinical research, and eventually, clinical practice. Vellum’s technology is based on positron emission tomography
(PET) radiotracer derivatives of the synthetic antibiotic trimethoprim (TMP) and engineered expression of its
protein target E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (eDHFR). When eDHFR is expressed via a genetic medicine (e.g.,
cells harboring lentiviral or adeno-associated viral vectors or therapeutic mRNA), TMP radiotracers can be used
to measure the expression of the protein products in any tissue within the body. Our strategy has been used to
monitor the trafficking of CAR T cells targeting several types of tumors in rodents in collaboration with several
different research groups at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) and a global pharmaceutical company. In
this STTR phase 1, we propose the development of a GMP-compliant eDHFR viral vector that can be applied in
a modular fashion to different cellular therapies to monitor their biodistribution over time. This “stand-alone”
imaging vector dovetails with Vellum and UPenn’s on-going collaborative STTR Phase I grant focused on
optimizing [18F]-FTMP production to provide a commercial supply of the radiotracer (R41EB034141). In Aim 1,
we will evaluate the feasibility of using a stand-alone imaging vector format in vitro, which can then be applied
to different cellular therapies in collaboration with the Penn Center for Cellular Immunotherapies (CCI). In Aim
2, we take the enabling steps to perform quality control measures and functional assessment of the vector both
in vitro and in vivo and take the necessary steps to manufacture a GMP-compliant eDHFR lentiviral vector. This
process has been initiated via an established relationship with a CRO to produce the IND-ready DNA plasmids
in collaboration with the CCI and with the “line-of-sight” assistance of the Penn Vector Core for the future clinical
grade lentivirus. Taken together, these short-term aims will provide the evidence base needed for the final
justification and creation of eDHFR viral vectors that allow monitoring of investigational cell therapies in patients
at UPenn. We envision that our approach will substantially impact our understanding of why a cell therapy
product is successful or fails on an individual patient level using non-invasive imaging."
10977613,"PROJECT SUMMARY
NIH RFA AG-24-041 requests applications to determine the neural mechanisms that underlie the association
between gait and cognition in aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias
(ADRD). Mobility declines precede mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in most older adults. Understanding the
neural control of gait in these individuals will inform the use of gait changes as an early biomarker for
AD/ADRD and lead to new, early interventions. Our well-composed, cross disciplinary team has the requisite
expertise in aging, cognitive decline, sensorimotor neuroscience, and spatial navigation to address this topic.
 We propose a novel and transformational perspective that the relationship between mobility disability and
MCI lies in vestibular and hippocampal contributions to gait and cognition. Vestibular function declines with
aging and is even more impacted in individuals with MCI and Alzheimer's disease (AD). These declines are
linked to falls in both typical aging and AD, a major health concern with often devastating consequences in
aging. It is well known that vestibular inputs project to the brainstem, cerebellum, and vestibular cortex. What is
less understood are vestibular projections to the hippocampus, primary motor cortex, and premotor areas. This
is a critical knowledge gap, as the hippocampus and other temporal lobe structures play a key role in spatial
navigation, a behavior which also declines in MCI and AD. The hippocampus shows rapid and early atrophy in
AD. Here, we test the novel hypothesis that vestibular declines impact walking in those with subjective
cognitive decline coupled with a family history of AD (placing them at high risk for AD). We propose that spatial
navigation performance during walking is more impaired in this population due to simultaneous cognitive and
motor demands on declining vestibular inputs. Aim 1 is to determine whether brain structure and network
segregation (how independently a network functions) of vestibular-motor and vestibular-hippocampal brain
regions are reduced in individuals with subjective cognitive decline. We will assess whether these brain metrics
are linked to declines in mobility and spatial navigation. Under Aim 2, we use cutting edge, mobile EEG
approaches to identify spectral power differences between those with subjective cognitive decline and typical
aging during actual walking and spatial navigation. In Aim 3, we will determine whether vestibular network
segregation can be restored with bilateral vestibular cortical transcranial direct current stimulation. We will
further determine whether blood biomarkers for phosphorylated tau and amyloid beta mediate brain-behavior
associations in Aim 4. The results will lead to a greater understanding of the neural control of gait and
cognitive-motor interactions in subjective cognitive decline, providing insights for new, early biomarkers and
interventions for impending declines."
10977620,"Abstract: Intratelencephalic (IT) excitatory cortical neurons project only within telencephalic structures – the
cortex and striatum – and make only callosal, corticostriatal, and intrahemispheric connections. They exhibited
massive amplification and diversification during mammalian cortical evolution and are therefore thought to
underlie the unique capabilities of human cognition. Despite their importance, little is currently known about
distinct IT subtypes and their contributions to cortical organization, function, and dysfunction in disease.
 Upper layer and deep layer IT neurons diverge in their axonal trajectories: upper layer IT neurons make
predominantly callosal cortico-cortical, intrahemispheric, and ipsilateral corticostriatal connections, whereas
deep IT neurons project fewer callosal axons and instead project more heavily to bilateral striatum. Upper layer
IT neurons demonstrate high differential gene expression in autism, a syndrome with predominant cognitive
symptoms, while IT neurons with corticostriatal connections are hypothesized to contribute to motor disorders.
Thus, dissecting IT subtypes is essential to understanding their unique contributions to neurological disease.
 One such disease that presents with varying cognitive and motor impairment is perinatal hypoxic
ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), the most common brain injury in term neonates. HIE often injures the cortex
and striatum, prime targets of IT neurons. Sequelae include cognitive or motor symptoms, suggesting that HIE
may differentially disrupt cortico-cortical and corticostriatal circuits mediated by distinct IT subtypes. My
preliminary transcriptomic data suggest that deep IT neurons demonstrate a greater burden of differential gene
expression after HIE than upper IT neurons, particularly in gene pathways that regulate axon development.
 In this proposal, I utilize two novel knock-in mouse lines, Wfs1-Flp and Deptor-CreER, that label
superficial and deep IT subsets, respectively. In Aim 1, I will perform anterograde and retrograde axonal tracing
to fully characterize the cortico-cortical and corticostriatal axonal projections from primary motor cortex in each
mouse line. In Aim 2, I will perform the Vannucci model of HIE in Wfs1-Flp and Deptor-CreER mice to assess
changes in cortico-cortical and corticostriatal axonal projections from upper and deep layer IT neurons after HIE.
Finally, in Aim 3, to assess cell-specific changes in gene expression after HIE with high spatial precision, I will
utilize the cutting-edge spatial transcriptomics platform MERFISH in mouse cortex after HIE compared to control
cortex. I will amplify the power of this approach by integrating MERFISH data with my existing single nucleus
RNA sequencing data from mouse cortex after HIE, providing an innovative informatics pipeline that combines
the high detection power of single nucleus transcriptomics with the laminar precision of spatial transcriptomics.
Through this work, I will disentangle the cell-specific responses of IT subtypes to HIE, laying the groundwork to
understand how disruptions in IT microcircuitry differentially contribute to cognitive versus motor symptoms and
uncovering candidate targets for future pursuit as cell-targeted therapies to ameliorate IT dysfunction after HIE."
10977002,"In natural vision, retinal stimulation is ever-changing due to saccades and observer motion, but our percept of
the world remains remarkably stable. How this is achieved is a major unsolved mystery in systems
neuroscience. Prior neurophysiological and psychophysical studies have identified three hypothetical encoding
strategies that may contribute to visual perceptual stability in the primate brain. First, neuronal representations
may carry a prospective code of what is expected to occupy the future receptive fields of neurons even before
our eyes land on the saccade target. Second, salient visual objects may be represented in terms of a
spatiotopic code, i.e. in world-coordinates (in addition to retinal coordinates), which could provide a perceptual
anchor even as the retinal representations shift. Third, neuronal representations may be hysteretic, with
responses depending not just on the current retinal image but also on the recent past. These three strategies
may operate in parallel across a network of cortical and subcortical brain regions to achieve stability. In this
grant cycle, we will investigate the contributions of area V4, a midlevel processing stage in the ventral visual
stream that is critical for form encoding and scene perception and is heavily interconnected with parietal,
frontal and subcortical brain regions. Using a combination of fixation and naturalistic behavioral paradigms,
immersive visual displays of objects, textures and scenes, and recordings with high-density Neuropixels
probes in the awake macaque monkey, we will investigate whether: (Aim 1) V4 neurons carry prospective
signals that are comprehensive in terms of feature selectivity, spatial coverage and precision, to provide
complete and precise trans-saccadic integration, (Aim 2) visual object representations in V4 are modulated by
gaze position akin to parietal gain fields, thereby providing an implicit representation in a spatiotopic reference
frame at the population level, and, (Aim 3) V4 responses to continuously changing stimuli (mimicking self-
motion) are hysteretic, i.e. responses change more slowly than the stimulus itself, thereby providing a neuronal
basis for stable perception during observer motion. Our results will: (i) support the development of new models
of midlevel cortical representations as a function of extraretinal inputs and current, future and past retinal
stimulation, (ii) delineate a framework of representational ebb and flow as animals saccade from one location
to the next in the visual world, (iii) provide insights into the neurophysiological basis for myriad psychophysical
results that have revealed how visual stimuli are integrated, what frames of reference (retinotopic vs
spatiotopic) are relevant and whether and how stimulus history contributes to object invariance and continuity
across saccades. Parallel experiments in area V2 will provide insights into how V4 representations may be
built. More broadly, the encoding models developed here based on controlled, rigorous characterizations, will
provide a critical framework for interpretation in future studies of naturalistic visual explorations in the
macaque, a growing direction for systems neuroscience research."

member status including leadership within and participating in trials for RTOG, ECOG, and ACRIN. Most
recently, within the NCTN, MCC/WCM has predominantly been involved in the Alliance, including affiliate
membership at the NYP-BMH site and COG while continuing to have some leadership roles in NRG Oncology
(including main membership at the NYP-BMH site and affiliate status at the NYP-Queens site). WCM was a
founding member of the N01 funded NYCC, now participating in the ETCTN via Ohio State University.
 The Research Specialist (Clinician Scientist) applicant Dr. Tagawa has been most intimately involved

10977541,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The prevalence and burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing worldwide. Patients who undergo
radical or partial nephrectomy for kidney cancer resemble the general population with comorbidities, but with
the difference that a majority undergo pre- and post-surgery abdominal imaging. Despite successful surgical
tumor removal, there is a concern for future progressive CKD. Following nephrectomy, the unaffected kidney
undergoes compensatory hypertrophy, and the degree of hypertrophy and kidney function decline depend on
the comorbidity burden and the amount of the removed kidney tissue. With the recent advances in artificial
intelligence (AI)--based quantification of kidney volumes from CT scans, there is an opportunity to evaluate
automated imaging biomarkers as prognostic tools. There are also algorithms that quantify the number and
volume of simple parenchymal cysts and many radiomic/texture features. The Co-Principal Investigators in this
program are uniquely equipped for the proposed studies. Dr. Denic has expertise in kidney micro- and macro-
anatomy and advanced biostatistical skills. Dr. Kline has expertise in AI and developing advanced image
processing techniques. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that macrostructural findings on
imaging of the retained (non-operated) kidney after radical or partial nephrectomy are prognostic for
progressive CKD. In Aim 1, we will determine whether the degree of compensatory hypertrophy in the
retained kidney after nephrectomy predicts progressive CKD. Using a recently created deep learning algorithm
we developed, we will quantify the kidney, cortex, and medullary volumes in pre-surgery and follow-up CT
scans (at median 1-year post-surgery). From these volumes, we will calculate the degree of compensatory
changes in kidney volumes and assess their association with baseline comorbidities and microstructural
measures. Finally, we will develop models to predict progressive CKD. In Aim 2, we will first optimize and
finalize training of the model to quantify cysts and their size in CT images and develop postprocessing steps to
separate cortical from medullary cysts. We will then develop models to assess whether the number and size of
cysts (overall, cortical, medullary) in the retained kidney in pre-surgery scans, and changes in number and size
of cysts (overall, cortical, medullary) in the retained kidney over 1-year post-surgery, can predict progressive
CKD. In Aim 3, we will determine whether novel radiological imaging texture features on pre-surgery scans are
reflective of microstructural measures of nephron size and nephrosclerosis and whether kidney texture
features on follow-up CT scans predict progressive CKD. This research program will be facilitated by Mayo
Clinic’s outstanding clinical and research environment at all three sites dedicated to improving patient care.
The goal is to develop a tool that can guide clinical decision-making in everyday practice, and that can help
clinicians in improving their care of patients at an individual level by assessing the future risk of CKD."
10977557,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) reduces pain and disability caused by knee osteoarthritis, but the
surgery results in substantial trauma to the knee. This acute trauma exacerbates underlying weakness—
especially in the quadriceps. Quadriceps strength decreases by 80% just days after surgery and remains
60% impaired 1 month after surgery, which leads to a decrease in patient functional performance of up to
90%. This acute strength leads to muscle atrophy, which likely contributes to the long-term weakness and
disability patients with TKA experience relative to their healthy peers. Therefore, attenuating quadriceps
strength loss should be a primary target for improving rehabilitation outcomes after TKA.
Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is recommended in recent TKA clinical practice guidelines to
attenuate quadriceps strength loss. In controlled settings, NMES has established efficacy and attenuates
quadriceps strength loss by 40% in the first month after surgery by overriding muscle activation deficits and
reducing muscle atrophy. However, the effectiveness of NMES after TKA has not been adequately studied in
real-world clinical settings, and our preliminary data suggests that less than 4% of rehabilitation clinicians
are using NMES as recommended by current TKA practice guidelines. Therefore, we propose to conduct
a cluster randomized trial in two healthcare systems (Intermountain Health and UCHealth) and their associated
outpatient physical therapy clinics (n=30) to evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of NMES to
address musculoskeletal deficits after TKA. We will compare outcomes between patients who receive
contemporary rehabilitation supported by a comprehensive NMES implementation strategy (NMES) to patients
who receive contemporary musculoskeletal rehabilitation alone (Usual Care). We will gather information on
NMES implementation to promote its uptake and translation to clinical practice.
 This study will fundamentally change rehabilitation practice to improve function, strength, and
quality of life for millions of Americans who undergo TKA each year. This investigation seeks to provide
large-scale, foundational evidence that NMES is effective and can be systematically implemented into TKA
rehabilitation practice. It will also evaluate and identify effective implementation tools and strategies that
healthcare organizations can readily adopt and deploy to promote widescale NMES usage after TKA."

Disruptions of epigenetic mechanisms that regulate gene expression are frequently found in cancer and
collaborate with genetic alterations to drive cancer phenotypes such as therapy resistance and immune escape.
Since 2016, Dr. Bennett, the research specialist for this R50 award application, has supervised teams of
researchers and performed key experiments for the NCI-funded research program of the unit director, Dr.
Jonathan Licht, at the University of Florida Health Cancer Center to study how epigenetic mechanisms are
disrupted in cancer. Dr. Bennett has strong track record of important contributions to cancer research, and his
work has been instrumental to the success of CA195732, U54CA193419 and U01CA225566. He has
demonstrated that a glutamate to lysine mutation at amino acid 76 of histone H2B fundamentally alters chromatin
dynamics and accessibility, causing changes in gene expression and cell growth properties that favor
tumorigenesis. Dr. Bennett showed that treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells harboring mutant
histone methyltransferase NSD2 with PRC2 inhibitors can reactivate glucocorticoid (GC) receptor expression
and restore sensitivity of these cells to GC therapy. In addition, he has determined genetic dependencies for
growth and therapy resistance in uveal melanoma as well as identified an HDAC8-driven permanent lineage
switch maintained after drug withdrawal in melanoma. This R50 award will provide career stability for Dr. Bennett
to continue making important contributions to cancer research and advancing the unit director’s larger NCI-
funded research program. Dr. Bennett will lead research teams and perform key experiments to accomplish the
aims of the Dr. Licht’s three NCI-funded R01 awards: R01CA266078 (Histone fold Mutations in Cancer
Pathogenesis), multi-PI R01CA256193 (Characterization and targeting of the epigenetic state underlying uveal
melanoma liver metastasis) and multi-PI R01CA262483 (Defining and targeting epigenetic plasticity-driven drug
resistance and immune escape in melanoma). In addition, funding of this award will allow Dr. Bennett to pioneer
new directions for each project especially by applying cutting-edge technologies and building collaborations with
other NCI-funded investigators. Dr. Bennett is an expert in a wide spectrum of epigenomics techniques such as
biochemical assays, gene expression analysis, chromatin profiling and CRISPR screens that are essential for
the success of these awards and advancing the unit director’s NCI-funded cancer research program. These
studies will reveal new epigenetic mechanisms of oncogenesis that contribute to tumor progression,
heterogeneity, and therapy resistance, with the aim of finding new targets and pathways of intervention for cancer
patients that will ultimately lead to better patient outcomes."
10977804,"Project Summary / Abstract
Chronic lung disease in children with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA-LD) is a life-threatening disorder
which is increasing in incidence and for which there are no proven effective treatments. SJIA-LD manifests as
interstitial lung disease (ILD) with varying degrees of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), fibrosis, and
pulmonary artery hypertension, and frequently progresses to hypoxic respiratory failure. Although research is
urgently needed to define optimal treatments for SJIA-LD, key knowledge gaps remain that are barriers
to future research: a case definition, prospective evaluation of clinical disease progression, surrogate
biomarkers of disease activity, and LD-specific patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Our objectives are to
define SJIA-LD, its clinical disease progression, and surrogate biomarkers, to accelerate future research in this
disease. We have developed and published preliminary outcome measures, identified serum inflammatory
mediators and markers of lung injury in SJIA-LD patients, and piloted surveys to identify SJIA-LD specific
symptoms that can be measured using validated PROs. To operationalize these preliminary findings, we have
launched a pilot multicenter prospective cohort study of SJIA-LD, which to date has enrolled 45 patients through
the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) Registry. Our central hypothesis
is that this proposed SJIA-LD study will result in the ability to accurately define SJIA-LD cases and
characterize disease trajectories, and validate surrogate biomarkers of clinical disease progression and
LD-specific PROs. In this study, we will enroll ~80 SJIA-LD patients across the CARRA network, and
prospectively collect clinical data, biosamples and PROs over 2 years of follow-up. In Aim 1, we will determine
the clinical SJIA-LD characteristics and progression by collecting LD features at baseline and longitudinally, and
use this to support a data-derived expert consensus definition of SJIA-LD. In Aim 2, we will validate biomarkers
of inflammation and lung injury in children with SJIA-LD by determining longitudinal (baseline, 6-months, and
end-of-study) levels of cytokines, chemokines and lung injury markers, their responsiveness to change, and
correlating them with clinical disease activity. In Aim 3, we will utilize PRO measures that reflect quality of life
and lung disease symptoms in children with SJIA-LD by tracking changes in existing measures captured through
the CARRA Registry, as well as in previously-validated lung disease-specific instruments which measure patient-
reported SJIA-LD symptoms. We will leverage the CARRA Registry and infrastructure to longitudinally assess
clinical disease features, surrogate biomarkers of disease activity, lung damage and PROs in a prospective
cohort of children with SJIA-LD. Successful completion of the proposed aims are necessary to accelerate future
clinical research, including interventional studies, and advance our long-term goals to treat and prevent SJIA-

10977871,"The older adult population (OAs; e.g., ≥65 years old) is projected to almost double between 2012 and 2050 in
the United States. This population already disproportionately utilizes surgical services and this is projected to
increase with this increase in the OA population. OAs have higher rates of complications after major colorectal
surgery, particularly those who are frail. In addition, pre-existing functional and cognitive decline can also amplify
the consequences of surgical complications. Finally, changes to bowel, urinary or sexual function are common
in OAs after major colorectal surgery and can significantly impact quality of life. Thus, surgical shared decision-
making (SDM) in this population is more complex.
SDM is an approach well suited to manage complex decision making, such as high risk surgery in frail OAs.
However SDM is not often successfully done prior to surgery, particularly in the OA population. SDM tools have
been utilized to promote and improve SDM, but there is a gap in SDM tools specific to the frail OA population
considering major colorectal surgery. A scoping review of existing provider facing tools for SDM show that most
are risk calculators intended for elective surgical risk assessment but few addressed patient-centered domains
such as assessment of patient goals, postoperative expectations such as changes to physical or cognitive
function or independence, anticipated changes to quality of life, and long-term risks.
As the population of the US continues to age, it will place greater demands on surgical services and is important
that the medical community meet these growing demands and ensure high quality care for OA surgical patients,
particularly those who are frail and most vulnerable within this population. The American College of Surgeons
Geriatric Surgery Verification Program has recognized improvement of the surgical SDM process as an important
standard of care in this patient population. There is a critical need to improve the SDM process in this population
that is particularly vulnerable, growing in size, and with unique needs to improve outcomes, ensure high quality
care, and inform decision making with patients and their families.
This proposal will help develop a user-friendly SDM tool for surgeons, specific to the needs of frail older adults
considering major colorectal surgery, to improve communication in the surgical SDM process. This will be
achieved through a Delphi process of clinical experts and patient representatives to adapt an existing SDM to
be specific for the proposed population utilizing the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Methodology. This tool will
then be pilot tested amongst providers to examine implementation outcomes (e.g., feasibility, barriers to use,
utility of the tool) using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and explore quality
of SDM among patients. This proposal will adapt an existing tool for SDM in the frail OA population considering
major colorectal surgery and pilot the tool to inform larger scale testing and multi-site implementation to
evaluate its effects on the quality of surgical SDM through a later R01."
10977872,"Summary – This proposal takes crucial next steps towards illuminating the mechanistic impact of regulatory
variation underlying common disease risk and progression, focusing on Parkinson's disease (PD) as a model.
The majority of disease-associated variants identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) lie in
noncoding DNA, likely influencing transcription of their cognate genes. Thus, improving our understanding of
how regulatory variation can impact gene expression, and the downstream cellular mechanisms through which
they modulate disease susceptibility, is crucial. The acquisition of biologically relevant genomic data, across the
cellular contexts in which the variants may exert their effects, is imperative for the prioritization and functional
assay of variants within associated loci, as well as the determination of their mechanistic impact.
 Towards this end, we have already made significant strides in studying the chromatin and transcriptional
landscapes of gestational/early postnatal dopaminergic (DA) neurons and improved our understanding of how
regulatory variation confers risk for PD. We have previously generated catalogs of open chromatin regions
(OCRs) and similarly profiled gene expression of midbrain and forebrain DA neurons. We have developed and
implemented computational classifiers to identify key transcription factors (TFs) that actively influence gene
expression and have identified PD-associated functional variation falling within novel enhancers. Although they
establish a powerful precedent, these studies query only a snapshot early in normal DA neuron biology.
 Here, we propose to link regulatory variants, the cell state(s) in which they act, the genes they influence, and
the mechanisms through which they impact PD risk. We aim to define chromatin and transcriptional signatures
derived from PD-vulnerable DA neurons over time and in response to PD-relevant insult of α-synuclein preformed
fibrils (Aim 1). Further, we will develop novel tools to computationally “learn” the sequence-basis of the cell
type/state dependent OCRs, via machine learning, undertaking massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) to
test thousands of OCRs, and predicted disease risk variation therein, using DA neurons derived from human
induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-DA) from unaffected individuals (Aim 2). In Aim 3, we will test the functional
consequences of disrupting predicted key TFs and enhancers on a range of PD-relevant cellular phenotypes
using hiPSC-DA neurons. We will similarly evaluate the molecular and cellular effects of risk and non-risk
variation therein, using hiPSC-DA harboring established PD mutations, to provide a greater opportunity of
observing functional effects. Our proposal will advance our understanding of regulatory encryption and how
noncoding, functional variation perturbs molecular mechanisms in common disease risk and progression,
particularly for PD. Additionally, our findings will inform mechanisms underpinning other PD-related disorders
including diffuse Lewy Body Disease and Lewy Body Dementia and the increased risk of cognitive
decline/dementia in Gaucher’s."
10993692,"Abstract
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second highest cause of cancer-related deaths in men. African American/Black
(AA/B) men are disproportionally impacted by PCa with a 60% higher incidence of disease and a 2-3x fold
increase in mortality risk compared to European American (EA) men. There is an urgent need to identify the
underlying biological changes that give rise to this disparity to develop inclusive diagnostic and predictive tests
and tailored therapeutic treatments. A myriad of causes for the biological changes that drive PCa health
disparities have been proposed, including socioeconomic, genetic, and environmental factors. These factors all
give rise to altered metabolism, a biological change associated with PCa onset and progression. A proposed
mechanism for how these changes drive PCa is through the production of the reactive electrophile methylglyoxal
(MG). MG is a by-product of lipid, protein, and sugar metabolism and forms covalent adducts on DNA, RNA, and
protein. These adducts, termed MG-advanced glycation end products (MG-AGEs) lead to DNA mutations and
genomic instability, change RNA stability and translation, and alter protein stability and function. In addition, MG-
AGEs bind and activate the receptor for AGEs (RAGE). To regulate MG and MG-AGEs, cells use glyoxalase 1
(GLO1) to detoxify MG and soluble RAGE (sRAGE) to sequester MG-AGEs and prevent RAGE activation. These
components are termed the AGE/RAGE axis. Our long-term goal is to define the role of MG-AGEs and the
AGE/RAGE axis as biomarkers and drivers of PCa and determine how racial disparities influence this process.
To define the association of MG-AGEs, GLO1, RAGE, and sRAGE with PCa health disparities, we designed a
nested case-control trial of AA/B and EA men with and without PCa. We measured serum MG-AGEs using mass
spectrometry, serum sRAGE using ELISA, and sequenced the GLO1 and AGER (gene encoding RAGE) loci in
genomic DNA isolated from whole blood. We discovered that MG-AGEs, sRAGE, and GLO1 and AGER SNPs
were significantly associated with PCa in AA/B men but not EA men. We also observed a significant difference
between these components in AA/B and EA men without PCa. This led us to hypothesize that MG-AGEs,
sRAGE, and GLO1 and AGER SNPs may have utility as biomarkers for PCa in AA/B men and that GLO1 SNPs
may play a role in the accumulation of MG-AGEs, mutations, and PCa cell growth. To test this hypothesis, we
propose to 1) use molecular and genetic features of the AGE/RAGE axis along with demographic and clinical
variables to predict the risk of PCa in AA/B and EA men using a multivariable clinical-genetic risk model and 2)
use cell lines derived from AA/B and EA PCa tumors to determine the impact of GLO1 SNPs on MG-AGE
accumulation, cell growth, the expression of metastatic markers, and the induction of genomic mutations. This
work represents the first analysis of MG-AGEs in AA/B and EA men with PCA, utilizes novel mass spectrometry
methods, and describes generation of cell lines expressing GLO1 polymorphisms from diverse racial groups."
10993693,"OVERALL SUMMARY. Major depressive disorder (MDD) topped heart disease as the number one cause of
disability worldwide, and women have twice the risk of men. MDD is associated with abnormalities in the stress
response circuitry, areas that are among the most sexually dimorphic in the brain. These areas are dense in
sex steroid and glucocorticoid receptors coupled with cytokine receptors. Further, activity in these areas has
been associated with cortisol response, autonomic dysfunction, and immune responses, which we showed
differed by sex. This is important since autonomic dysregulation is significantly associated with cardiovascular
disease. In fact, women are at twice the risk for the co-occurrence of MDD, autonomic dysregulation and heart
disease, leading to a 3-5-fold risk of death in women from heart disease, often with unrecognized and
untreated MDD. Thus, understanding early biomarkers for sex differences in MDD and autonomic
dysregulation will provide knowledge for early intervention, attenuating later life disability, in particular for
women who are at higher risk. The scientific mission of this SCORE is to identify stress-immune pathway
abnormalities, beginning in fetal development, that have shared consequences for sex differences in brain
circuitry regulating mood and lifelong recurrent MDD and dysregulation of hormone and immune responses to
stress, and autonomic and neurovascular dysfunction in early midlife. We aim to facilitate transdisciplinary,
translational collaboration among basic and clinical investigators to enhance our understanding of the impact of
sex on MDD and central and peripheral autonomic function and provide the groundwork for translating this
knowledge into sex-selective therapeutics. Further, we aim to serve as an interdisciplinary resource to train
and disseminate findings about sex differences in MDD and autonomic dysregulation to the scientific and
medical communities, policy makers, and the public. To accomplish this, three integrated studies are proposed:
1) a clinical population neuroscience study relating prenatal risk biomarkers to sex differences in brain circuitry
and physiologic deficits in response to stress in MDD in early midlife; 2) clinical study using direct
transcutaneous neuromodulatory stimulation of the vagus nerve, auricular branch (or taVNS) to target the
circuitry associated with stress-immune function and map its neuroanatomic, physiologic and clinical effects in
MDD by sex, in the same subjects as in project 1; and 3) rodent model studies that will map out the central
mechanistic pathways involved in projects 1 and 2. In addition, three cores will contribute to the success of this
SCORE: 1) Leadership Administration Core to administer and oversee the administrative integration of the
studies and cores; 2) Resources Core to provide shared technical expertise across studies; and 3) Career
Enhancement Core, to supplement the training of junior faculty and others on the topic of our SCORE, and
become pedagogical ambassadors to the scientific, medical and public communities about sex differences in
depression and comorbidities with general medicine, a topic with global public health implications."

10993957,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall objective of this project is to develop novel approaches to examine the dynamics of brain chemistry
and establish correlations between molecular mechanisms and differences in behavior, especially related to
cocaine use. Previous studies have established that cocaine use alters both dopamine release and neuronal
structure, contributing to compulsive drug-seeking behavior. Yet no study has comprehensively analyzed the
brain metabolome to discover additional changes in neurochemistry related to cocaine use. This knowledge gap
is primarily due to the poor resolution and sensitivity of current liquid one-dimensional chromatography-mass
spectrometry (1D-LC-MS) methods to analyze the diverse chemical composition present in the small sample
volumes of brain dialysate. This work will develop novel ultra-high resolution instrumentation and computational
methods to test our overall hypothesis that cocaine use causes both short-term and long-term metabolomic
alterations in the brain. We further hypothesize that these alterations are differentially expressed based on
behavioral phenotype and sex. In Aim 1, we will develop an in vivo metabolomic profile of the nucleus
accumbens, a brain region related to motivation and reward, by integrating miniaturized column and stationary
phase particle technology into a novel comprehensive two-dimensional LC-MS platform. The information
obtained in Aim 1 will provide a valuable resource for both our future aims and neurochemistry research. In Aim
2, we will discover the temporal and differential impacts of cocaine intake on the brain metabolome using
selectively bred high-responder (bHR) and low-responder (bLR) rats, an animal model for drug-seeking behavior.
Use of fast, ultra-high resolution capillary 1D-LC-MS and computational algorithms will efficiently discover
temporal differences in the metabolome of bHRs/bLRs and males/females. Aim 3 will characterize the differential
impact related to acquisition of cocaine self-administration on the brain metabolome using bHRs, bLRs, and
outbred rats trained to self-administer cocaine. Machine learning will demonstrate our ability to predict
compulsive drug-seeking behavior based on metabolomic differences. The information obtained from Aims 2-3
will reveal new metabolomic pathways associated with psychostimulant use, ultimately providing new targets for
early medical intervention. This F32 proposal will advance my training at the intersection of analytical chemistry,
metabolomics, and neuroscience at the research-rich environment of the University of Michigan. Included in the
training plan are the development of technical skills like microdialysis, animal models, and hypothesis-driven
research design and professional skills like mentorship, teaching pedagogy, scientific communication, and grant
preparation. Ultimately, the work outlined in this proposal will strengthen my transition to an independent research
career as a tenure-track professor."
11002040,"PROJECT SUMMARY____________________________________________________________________
The goal of CHIPP-PrEP: Cabotegravir-Hormone Interrogation of Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics for
HIV Prevention in Cisgender and Transgender Persons is to improve the medical care of transgender women
(TGW) and gender diverse persons assigned male at birth who are accessing estrogen-based gender affirming
hormone therapy (GAHT) through characterizing the relationship between GAHT and long-acting cabotegravir
(CAB-LA) for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). A key strategy to improve the quality of life among
transgender and gender diverse (TGD) persons is the provision of gender affirming care, including GAHT.
However, a persistent concern among persons who access GAHT is the potential impact of other medications
on exogenous hormone regimens. HIV infection remains a public health priority, and TGW are
disproportionately affected by HIV, with a global prevalence of 19.9%. The HIV Prevention Trials Network
(HPTN) 083 trial showed that CAB-LA was more effective than emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
(F/TDF) in preventing HIV in cisgender men and TGW who have sex with men. CAB-LA pharmacokinetics
(PK) were evaluated in a subset of TGW who reported or denied GAHT-use; while drug concentrations were
similar, steady state trough (Ctau-SS) CAB-LA concentrations were modestly higher among TGW who reported
GAHT use. Further, CAB-LA PK parameters, including absorption rate constant (Ka), are influenced by sex
assigned at birth, body mass index (BMI) and needle length (indicator of injection site fat distribution); of note,
CAB-LA maximal concentrations (Cmax-SS) are lower and Ctau-SS are higher in cisgender women as compared to
cisgender men, which may result in protective pharmacologic advantages in women. However, the impact of
GAHT on CAB-LA Ka among TGW and gender diverse persons assigned male at birth has not been evaluated,
and it is unknown if hormone concentrations or GAHT use are significant covariates on CAB-LA PK. Based
on the complex interactions of estrogens on body composition and fat distribution, absence of CAB-LA
pharmacologic correlates of protection, and the paucity of data detailing drug interactions between GAHT and
CAB-LA, additional data are needed to understand the PK and PD interactions between GAHT and CAB-LA for
an understudied and at-risk population. The proposed work will address these gaps through the following: a)
evaluation of the multi-compartment CAB-LA PK in cisgender persons and TGW and gender diverse persons
assigned male at birth who are on a stable regimen of estrogen-based GAHT; b) development of a CAB-LA
PK/PD model using ex vivo HIV susceptibility assays; and c) generation of a popPK model inclusive of PK and
PD data from TGW and gender diverse persons and subsequent simulations to evaluate the contribution of
estrogen-based GAHT on CAB-LA PK parameters. The proposed research provides a critical next step in our
understanding of CAB-LA for HIV prevention, and may provide rationale for sex and gender-specific CAB-LA
dosing with current and future CAB-LA formulations to optimize protection efficacy."
11003492,"Acoustic communication is crucial for social interactions in many species, including humans.
Understanding the neural underpinnings that govern the production and processing of communication sounds is
paramount to advance the fields of auditory neuroscience and social behavior. Studies investigating speech and
sound processing in humans have mostly implemented non-invasive methods, leaving a gap in knowledge about
underlying neural mechanisms. My project bridges this gap by exploiting scientific advantages of echolocating
bats, mammals that produce and process a rich repertoire of acoustic signals, to investigate the circuits that
contribute to the discrimination of complex sounds that carry different meanings. Bats are social mammals with
well-developed audio-vocal systems and produce ultrasonic vocalizations for navigation and social
communication, providing a distinct opportunity to study the pathways, molecules and brain regions, which
enable complex sound processing. Aim 1 combines behavior and neurophysiology to investigate the specific
acoustic features of communication calls that are key to evoke behavioral responses and the neural systems
involved in sound discrimination. Aim 2 combines psychophysical, neurophysiological, and pharmacological
inactivation methods to study the midbrain-amygdala circuit’s role in mediating discrimination of sounds that
show overlap in spectro-temporal features but carry different semantic content. Aim 3 investigates circuit
phenomena in a social context by combining neurophysiological recordings and targeted pharmacological
inactivation in freely interacting bats. The overarching hypothesis of this research program is that social-
emotional processing of auditory stimuli through a midbrain-amygdala circuit mediates the discrimination of
sounds that carry different meaning. The significance of this project resides in the extraordinary scientific
opportunities to bridge studies of auditory behaviors, single neuron recordings, circuit dissection and
computational modeling in a mammalian model. This work will contribute key new knowledge of natural sound
processing mechanisms in mammals that could inform a deeper understanding of human auditory
communication disorders. This supplement will enable the training of Zaria George to carry out Aim 3 of the
project. The University of Illinois at Chicago offers an outstanding environment to conduct the independent
portion of this project, as it provides access to world class research facilities, seminars and workshops offered
by the Laboratory of Integrative Neuroscience; along with an extraordinary network of colleagues and
collaborators."
11002559,"Project Summary
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common hepatic disease in pediatrics, affecting about
30% of obese youth. The term NAFLD defines a wide spectrum of disease severity ranging from simple
intrahepatic fat accumulation without liver injury (steatosis) to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis and
cirrhosis. A 20-year retrospective study has shown that subjects who develop NAFLD during their youth have
about 13 times higher mortality rate for end-stage liver disease than healthy subjects of similar age and gender
NAFLD is highly prevalent among Hispanic youth, while non-Hispanic Black (NHB) youth are protected against
intrahepatic fat accumulation even in the presence of severe obesity and insulin resistance. Understanding the
pathophysiology underlying these differences could shed new light on the mechanisms leading to NAFLD in
obese youth. Our preliminary data suggest that Hispanic and NHB obese youth might have a different ability to
metabolize carbohydrates (CHO) through glycolysis, with Hispanics showing higher glycolysis than NHB.
Therefore, Hispanics might experience a higher rated tricyclic acid cycle (TCA) and hepatic de novo
lipogenesis (DNL). In the present study we aim to address the following questions 1) Is the different
susceptibility between Hispanics and NHB in developing NAFLD due to a higher capability of Hispanics to
metabolize CHO through glycolysis, TCA cycle and DNL? 2) Do these metabolic changes anticipate the onset
of the disease in Hispanic youth? 3) Are the higher rates of glycolysis, TCA and DNL driven by high but not-
pathologic changes in glucose levels over time? To address our aims we plan to recruit 30 Hispanics and 30
NHB obese youth and to measure glycolysis by using a new method to assess lactate kinetics and to
determine the TCA cycle and DNL by using 13C-Propionate and D2O. Moreover, we will assess glycolysis
and intrahepatic fat content in a group of 150 Hispanic obese youth without fatty liver at baseline every 12
months for two years to determine whether higher glycolytic rates precede intrahepatic fat accumulation. To
assess whether metabolic changes in glycolysis are driven by higher but not-pathologic glucose levels, we will
measure glucose changes over ten days every six months by using a continuous glucose monitoring system. If
successful these studies will provide novel insight into the pathogenesis of pediatric NAFLD and will open new
avenues to test novel therapeutic approaches."

 This K08 Career Development Award proposal for Dr. Filipe de Carvalho describes a research plan and
career development program leading up to an academic career as an independent Urologic Oncologist surgeon-
scientist investigator. Dr. De Carvalho is a urologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital committed to an
independent research career focused on accelerating the development of therapeutic strategies to target the
immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment in bladder cancer. This Career Development award will allow Dr.
De Carvalho to become proficient in tumor-associated macrophage biology in bladder cancer with the ultimate
goal of developing novel macrophage-directed therapeutic strategies for bladder cancer patients. Dr. De
Carvalho will be mentored by Dr. Eliezer Van Allen and co-mentors Drs. Kent Mouw and Elizabeth Mittendorf,
leaders in bladder cancer genomics and cancer immunology. Dr. Van Allen is Chief of Division of Population
Sciences, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and has mentored over a dozen of young investigators that moved to
successful independent academic positions. Dr. De Carvalho also gathered an outstanding scientific advisory
committee and collaborators that excel in mouse models, statistics and cancer genomics to guide career
development and scientific progress.
 The research proposal focuses on tumor-associated macrophages, which are immune cells with a critical
role in tumor growth and immune evasion. Recent evidence revealed a therapy-induced conversion of normally
anti-tumor TAMs to a tumor-permissive phenotype. The central hypothesis is that cisplatin induces chronic
immunosuppressive IFN signaling in cancer cells leading to a TAM-infiltrated phenotype and immune evasion in
treatment-resistant tumors. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine the
mechanism and effectiveness of targeting TAMs to improve sensitivity of bladder cancer to combined cisplatin
and immune checkpoint inhibition. 2) Dissect the tumor-TAM crosstalk that mediates cisplatin resistance. These
studies are expected to dissect how TAMs inhibit cytotoxic T-cells in cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer in
territories of immune evasion across bladder tumors as well as position Dr. De Carvalho to submit a competitive
R01 near the completion of this Award."
10985203,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Many people hesitate to contribute their biospecimens and data, including genomic data, for research because
they believe that misuse is likely. Biobanks have a tricky problem – that they must engender trust with
specimen contributors that they will protect biospecimens and data while simultaneously aiming to get
biospecimens and data to the investigators who can most use them. Most biobanks report underutilization of
their stored biospecimens and data (including genomic information) for reasons including underdeveloped,
unharmonized data management technologies. Without metadata to link permitted conditions for sharing and
reuse, biorepositories risk sharing resources which were impermissible to share or contributing to resource
inefficiencies by not sharing. The long-term goal of this research program is to respect and protect
biospecimen contributors’ autonomous choices and to promote transparency in how those choices are made
knowable across biorepositories’ information systems and expressed to individual investigators. The overall
objective of the proposed research is to empirically validate one or more standards-based models which make
permissions for biospecimen sharing and reuse understandable to machines. This study will include
examination of four information models and will be achieved through a single specific aim: to evaluate four
established machine-interpretable models for expressing permissions, restrictions, and obligations for
biospecimen and information sharing and reuse. Our rationale is: before biospecimen management
applications implement a model for labeling biospecimens and information resources according to permissions,
restrictions, and obligations which govern their reuse, that model must be vetted for accurate representation of
real-world consent forms and policy documents. This aim will be achieved through identifying and annotating
sentences from at least 20 consent forms which express permission or constraint regarding biospecimen and
data sharing and reuse, those sentences will be deconstructed according to the entities and processes within
each model, and the models will be evaluated in terms of their consistency, completeness, conciseness, and
interoperability. Additionally, the deconstructed sentences will be applied to each model’s response lists (or
value sets) and evaluated in terms of their integration with the model and coverage of the concepts. The
proposed research is innovative because it will be the first empirical validation of existing, potentially in-use
models using real-world consent forms. The proposed research is significant because more robust models
have the potential to enhance responsible stewardship of biospecimens and information, protect specimen
contributors’ autonomous choices, and engender trust between those contributors who gave consent and the
individual investigators who require permission to use biospecimens in research."

Endocrinopathies, sleep disorders, cognitive issues, cardiovascular conditions, sensory impairments, and ability
differences not only impact the quality of life of individuals with Down syndrome (DS) and their caregivers but
can intersect to magnify the threats of these co-occurring conditions. Moreover, individuals with intellectual
disabilities face additional barriers surrounding healthcare access and their decision-making involvement that
can jeopardize their health. The dearth of observational studies that richly detail co-occurring conditions, social
determinants of health (SDoH), and the ableism individuals with DS experience represents a major challenge to
providing clinical care to individuals with DS. Our long-term objective is to partner with clinicians, researchers,
individuals with DS, and caregivers across the country to establish a diverse cohort of individuals with DS for
comprehensive longitudinal phenotyping including multi-omics and to develop an infrastructure for intervention
studies. This multi-center, multi-disciplinary collaborative team will engage individuals from infancy through
young adulthood to undergo blood sample collection, imaging studies, qualitative interviews, questionnaire
completion, sleep assessments, and remote physiologic monitoring while subsets will undergo additional specific
procedures with the goal of rich longitudinal phenotyping across multiple systems:
 Endocrine: thyroid and gonadal function
 Cardiometabolic: lipids, inflammation, meal-related glucose excursion, insulin secretion & sensitivity
 Cardiovascular: blood pressure, arterial stiffness, and left ventricular mass and function
 Nutrition: anthropometrics, body composition, bone density, nutritional intake, and appetite/satiety
 Sleep: obstructive and central sleep apnea, hypoventilation, participant and caregiver sleep quantity and quality
 Physical Activity: sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous activity
 Neurocognitive: caregiver reported and objectively assessed measures, peripheral blood Alzheimer disease
 markers, audiology, brain MRI, secondary analyses of sleep study EEG
 SDoH: family education, income, English proficiency, medical literacy, neighborhood characteristics
 Ethical Issues: decision-making involvement, experiences with ableism, and healthcare access
 Electronic Health Information: diagnoses, medications, procedures, labs, and imaging
 Multi-omics: genome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome
Procedures will be repeated at a cadence that depends upon baseline age (<15y, every 12-18 mo) or (>15-30y,
every 24-30 mo), baseline results, pre-existing co-morbidities, and subsequent interventions. Community
members will help inform study design and the specific procedures to be undertaken will be tailored to the abilities
of individuals with DS and to minimize participant and caregiver burden."

In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), human papillomavirus (HPV) and HIV create a dual burden of disease that
causes significant morbidity and mortality in the form of cervical cancer (CC). Women living with HIV (WLWH)
have a six-fold higher risk of developing precancerous lesions that persist and progress to CC, which is the
leading cause of cancer mortality among women in Kenya. Significant support from the Go Further campaign,
represented by donors such as the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the George W.
Bush Institute, UNAIDS, Merck, and Roche, to integrate CC screening into HIV clinics represents an
exceptional opportunity to scale CC impact across SSA, but only if implementation science evidence is
available to inform strategy. Currently, the impact of Go Further has been undermined by fractured linkages to
care and insensitive screening methods; in Kenya, less than 2% of WLWH screened have received appropriate
treatment. Implementation science studies are needed to better understand and surmount barriers to
integrated care in publicly funded HIV clinics. Specifically, we need to explore and innovate strategies to
overcome patient-, provider-, and system-level barriers to implementing CC screening and referral guidelines,
link WLWH who require further diagnostic testing and/or treatment with effective and accessible care, and
document services for accountability and quality improvement. In this proposal, our team will apply our
extensive implementation science expertise and partnerships with Kenya Ministry of Health (MOH) to adapt
and test evidence-based strategies (e.g., HPV self-testing, care navigators, and the WEMA mHealth app
[tested and scaled in Tanzania]) that address key multi-level barriers identified through a formative,
stakeholder-engaged research phase. Using the EPIS framework to guide our project, we will: Aim 1a),
Explore (engage a multi-disciplinary stakeholder advisory board to co-design the intervention package and
prioritize implementation strategies that align with local capacity, opportunities, and motivations; Aim 1b),
Prepare (develop tools and strengthen capacity at clinics to implement the strategies; Aim 2), Implement and
evaluate the package of implementation strategies via a cluster-randomized stepped wedge trial in 9 clinics
(assessing implementation [provision of CC screening with HPV self-testing] and effectiveness [proportion of
HPV-positive WLWH who receive subsequent diagnostic triage and/or treatment] over months 0-12; and Aim
3), assess Sustainability (costs, cost-effectiveness, and transfer of delivery from study to local staff over
months 13-18. The overall goal of this study is to employ rigorous empirical methods to adapt and test
implementation strategies that expand the scope of HIV care to screen for and treat early precancerous CC
lesions in a sustainable, scalable way. Through partnering with Kenya’s MOH, this project will have critical
institutional support and dissemination capability, and will directly inform public health practice and policy,
offering a high likelihood of sustainable cancer impact among WLWH that can be adopted across SSA."
11001766,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alzheimer's disease is a devastating neurodegenerative disease with limited therapeutic options. Progressive
accumulation of the pathological markers, hyperphosphorylated Tau (pTau), amyloid-beta, and gliosis begin up
to 20 years before cognitive impairment occurs. Published reports from our lab and others have shown that the
TgF344-AD rat model displays many of the early pathological abnormalities that occur in patients with AD,
including endogenous pTau accumulation in the locus coeruleus prior to other brain regions, Aβ accumulation
throughout hippocampus, degeneration of noradrenergic (NA) axons in hippocampus, reactive astrocytes and
microglia, as well as a synaptic dysfunction as early as 6 months in the dentate gyrus. Therapeutic strategies
that interfere with these pathological changes could slow disease progression. Increasing the post-
translational modification, O-GlcNAcylation, has received recent attention, as it competes with serine/threonine
phosphorylation on Tau, preventing its hyperphosphorylation and accumulation. Increasing O-GlcNAcylation
also increases non-amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein due to O-GlcNAcylation of gamma
secretase. Pharmacological inhibitors of O-GlcNAcase, the enzyme that removes O-GlcNAc moieties from
proteins, are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of AD in patients. Using the TgF344-AD rat model and a
combination of technical approaches including immunohistochemistry, confocal imaging, Western blot and
brain slice electrophysiology, my dissertation research focuses on pharmacologically increasing O-
GlcNAcylation in TgF344-AD rats to test whether it is therapeutically beneficial by (1) decreasing pathogenic
accumulation of pTau and amyloid-β (Aβ), preventing NA axon degeneration, and decreasing astrocyte and
microglia activation, (2) prevents the pathologically increased LTP due to β-ARs function at MPP-DG synapses
and (3) maintaining astrocyte function, including astrocytic β-ARs."

The goal of this project is to discover and develop a new therapeutic(s) more potent than current antifungals for the
treatment of invasive fungal infections. Among invasive fungal infections, cryptococcosis, candidiasis, and aspergillosis
are the most life-threatening.1-3 The incidence of these infections has risen more than 14-fold over the last 20 years,4-11
with a mortality rate of 1,300,000/year.12
We recently discovered a fungal enzyme, ceramide synthase 1 (Cer1), essential for fungal growth at neutral, alkaline
and acidic environments. Thus, a fungal mutant lacking Cer1 is not pathogenic in animal models because, upon
infection, it cannot survive in host neutral (lung and other organs), alkaline (blood) and acidic (inflammatory tissue)
environments.
Thus, Cer1 is an ideal target for the development of new antifungals because any compound blocking Cer1 will be
fungicidal. We have optimized a high throughput assay that allows the screen for inhibitors of ceramide synthase activity
and found few hits that selectively inhibit fungal Cer1. Thus, in this proposal we will continue the screening of the
ChemBridge DIVERSet libraries to select a potent hit molecule(s) that ideally target fungal but not mammalian Ceramide
synthases, to move it forward for medicinal chemistry and preclinical studies. We do have the experience and expertise
to perform these studies."

Electroencephalography (EEG) is an essential component in the evaluation of epilepsy, the most common
serious brain disorder worldwide. Misdiagnosis of epilepsy is very common and occurs in up to 50% of the
patients. Artifact contamination seriously hinders the effectiveness of EEG and is a root cause of misdiagnosis.
CREmedical is developing a tripolar concentric ring electrode (TCRE) sensor and a t-Interface that registers
tripolar EEG (tEEG) and emulated EEG (eEEG). tEEG resolves the fundamental drawbacks of conventional
EEG, providing significant improvement in signal fidelity, spatial resolution, and registering of higher frequency
brain activities, where conventional EEG is lacking. There is increasing interest in the epilepsy community in
analyzing high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) for localizing epileptogenic zones.
The overall objective of this SBIR fast-track project is to complete the necessary non-clinical and clinical
activities in order to enable the transition of the device from lab to clinical use. This project integrates
multidisciplinary expertise in technology, epilepsy, neurophysiology, and regulatory affairs.
The Phase I objective is to complete the non-clinical development activities necessary for commercialization
and obtaining IRB approval for initiating a clinical trial in epilepsy.
Ph I - Milestone 1: Obtain clear non-binding indication from the FDA that our proposed clinical trial protocol is
likely sufficient to obtain a 510 (k) regulatory clearance.
Ph I - Milestone 2: Obtain IRB confirmation that the proposed pre-clinical testing and clinical protocol are
appropriate to support the non-significant risk (NSR) clinical trial.
Ph I - Milestone 3: Develop head phantom and computer simulation to test contribution of local reference.
Ph I - Milestone 4: Establish Design and Quality Systems Control process.
Ph I - Milestone 5: Perform design verification and validation in pursuant to regulatory and industry standards.
The Phase II objective is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the tEEG device in recording electrical
brain activities in persons with epilepsy in preparation for obtaining FDA clearance.
Ph II – Milestone 1: Proven usability. (A) Do EEG technologists have problems applying and removing the
TCREs? (B) Are the tEEG and eEEG data interpretable? (C) Can tEEG and eEEG record patterns that are
also visible with concurrent conventional EEG?
Ph II – Milestone 2: Superiority of tEEG for artifacts suppression.
Ph II – Milestone 3: Superiority of tEEG for seizure detection.
Ph II – Milestone 4: Comparison between simultaneous intracranial recordings and tEEG for seizure
localization."
11009480,"Cognitive decline begins in early stages of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and progresses to dementia in 75% of
people with PD after ten years. Dopaminergic medication and deep brain stimulation (DBS) provide long-term
improvement of cardinal motor symptoms in PD, but cognitive decline remains largely unaddressed and
untreated, despite a long window for potential intervention before dementia occurs. Pre-clinical evidence
indicates that intermittent DBS of the Nucleus Basalis of Meynert (NBM) offers the potential to stabilize
deterioration of the cholinergic system and its negative impact on cognitive and cognitive-motor function in
individuals with mild cognitive impairment and PD. We propose to apply the three predictors of a successful
outcome for motor (dopaminergic) DBS to cognitive-motor (cholinergic) DBS: 1) select well-characterized
candidates before the stage of dementia 2) optimize target selection, lead location, and volume of tissue
activated (VTA), and 3) use intermittent neurostimulation patterns. We will utilize the UG3 phase to establish the
feasibility of a novel approach to target the NBM for DBS via tractography modeling and translate novel patterned
stimulation technology, in partnership with Boston Scientific and their research based Chronos software, for a
first in human study. We will obtain an Investigational Device Exemption to use Chronos for the first time in
human subjects and in a novel DBS target (i.e., NBM fiber bundles). Only after successful completion of the UG3
milestones related to these aspects of the project will we then transition to the UH3 phase of the study which will
consist of a small pilot clinical trial investigating the safety, tolerability, and effect of combined STN and
intermittent NBM DBS. Ten individuals with PD with cognitive impairment in at least one domain, but who do not
have dementia, will undergo implantation of STN + NBM DBS. A vertical approach targeting the central anterior
NBM region will be used in 5 participants, and a novel lateral approach targeting the lateral efferent fiber bundle
outflow of the NBM will be used in the other 5 participants. Participants will receive standard high-frequency
continuous STN stimulation and 1 hour/day of intermittent (60 Hz, 20 sec on, 40 sec off/minute) NBM stimulation.
Behavioral and cognitive measures will be measured every 6 for up to two years with the primary outcomes at
12 months. An independent scientific outcome will use fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography
(PET) to assess the effect of continuous or intermittent NBM stimulation on cortical blood flow and glucose
metabolism."

income countries (~1.6 million deaths/year), yet only ~23% of new TB patients receive a WHO recommended
nucleic acid test, while 37% receive tests with significantly lower sensitivity (e.g., smear microscopy), and ~40%
cases do not have access to testing. The critical gap in TB diagnostics, and the weakest link in global TB care,
is access to high-quality TB testing. In order to address this, the WHO has developed target product profiles for
the highest-priority TB diagnostic technologies and key among them is an affordable (<$2) urine-based antigen
test (e.g., lateral flow assay or LFA) for point-of-care (POC) testing in low resource settings. An accurate urine-
based antigen test that can provide both simplicity (add-wait-read operation) and low cost (<$2) has the potential
to close the immense gap in access to quality TB testing.
However, the only recommended and commercially available urine LFA for TB is the Determine TB LAM (DTB-
LAM) antigen test from Abbott. While high specificity enables use of the DTB-LAM test as a diagnostic, its limited
sensitivity has restricted its recommended use to severely immunocompromised populations (e.g., HIV+) (~10%
of all TB patients). More expensive LFA technologies like the FujiFilm TB LAM LFA with silver amplification
(~$8/test) and the ultra-sensitive electrochemiluminescence ELISA (ECL) ($10k instrument) platforms can offer
improved limits of detection (~50 fold lower than the DTB-LAM LFA) and generally improve clinical sensitivity
without compromising specificity, but they have similarly fallen short with immunocompetent patients.
To overcome this unmet need, Salus has recently developed the new Flow Direct assay, an affordable (<$2)
LFA-based, next-generation POC immunoassay that, similar to Abbott’s DTB-LAM and FujiFilm’s TB LAM
assays, targets LAM. However, Flow Direct reaches beyond Abbott’s and FujulFilm’s capabilities by providing:
of on-device removal of inhibitory urine matrix components, a visual readout, multiplexing with multiple Abs, and
a similar (or better) LOD than the ultrasensitive ECL laboratory instrument (i.e., < 10 pg/mL of LAM). Briefly,
through removal of inhibitory urine matrix components, Salus has now demonstrated the ability to detect LAM in
both HIV- AND HIV+ samples that falsely test negative by ultra-sensitive ECL, meaning Flow Direct has the
potential to be a single LFA-based test that can accurately diagnose TB in the vast majority of patients.
Here we propose to demonstrate the value of Flow Direct for TB urine LAM by completing the following Aims: In
Aim 1 (Phase I), screening, optimizing, and benchmarking membrane-based matrix removal from TB- spiked
samples; In Aim 2 (Phase I), performing verification of on-device matrix removal from spiked TB+ and TB-
samples; in Aim 3 (Phase II), finalizing the flow assay and device manufacturing for clinical evaluations; and in
Aim 4 (Phase II), evaluating the Flow device both in bio-banked clinical samples and in-country. Results will be
important to subsequent funding efforts for Flow Direct commercial development."

and may also be used in other diseases such as cancer and COVID-19. Although several anticoagulants
including heparins, warfarin, and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are used in the clinic, each agent suffers
from major and minor bleeding adverse effects. As of now, a safe anticoagulant that inhibits coagulation without
bleeding risk has not been developed as yet. Under the NHLBI's R01 mechanism, we earlier discovered that the
heparin-binding exosite 2 of human factor XIa (hFXIa) is remarkably different from other homologous coagulation
proteases (e.g., hFIIa, hFXa and others). We developed a novel design strategy that relies on anionic sulfates
and aromatic rings to effect highly selective recognition of hFXIa's exosite 2 resulting in inhibition of enzyme
activity. We developed a highly promising allosteric inhibitor, named sulfated D-chiro-inositol (SCI), which was
synthesized in four steps, displayed >100-fold selectivity for hFXIa; bound plasma FXIa in exosite 2 with an
affinity of 20–60 nM even when the enzyme's active site was covalently blocked; and inhibited in vivo arterial
and venous thrombosis in the rat at 250 µg per animal (~1 mg/kg) without enhancing tail bleeding. SCI was
tolerated at doses as high as 25 mg/rat suggesting a therapeutic window of ~100. SCI is a highly promising
anticoagulant; yet its pharmacokinetics is not the best. Using cues from heparin-based drugs, we hypothesize
that optimizing the number and position of sulfate groups on the D-chiro inositol scaffold, while also screening
its various stereoisomers would improve hFXIa affinity, inhibition potency, PK, pharmacodynamics (PD), and
chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) properties before embarking on IND-enabling studies. The current
proposal focuses on studying a library of 20 rationally designed SCI analogs with the goal of identifying at least
one LEAD AGENT for advanced stage pre-clinical development. The specific aims are 1) synthesis,
anticoagulation efficacy, and bleeding of 20 putative factor XIa inhibitors based on the SCI structure; 2) in vivo
antithrombotic efficacy, DMPK, in vitro and in vivo toxicity of inhibitors; and 3) scaled-up non-GMP synthesis,
CMC, dose escalation efficacy, and PD studies to identify one or two lead molecules. SCI has been claimed in
a US patent (#9,758,459 B2 titled `Allosteric modulators of factor XIa as anticoagulant agents') with the PI as
one of the inventors. Quantitative milestones with regard to synthesis, in vitro & in vivo efficacy, in vitro and in
vivo toxicity will be used to guide the transition from the R61 to R33 Phase. Alternatively, the best 1 (or 2) analogs
of SCI would be identified as the most promising agent for further IND-enabling studies starting from the 20
designed SCI analogs."

 There are 1.2 million people with HIV in the United States, of whom nearly one-fifth are women. Nearly
half of women with HIV (WWH) consumed alcohol in the past month, a proportion two to three times greater
than in the general female population. Among adults, alcohol consumption is increasing among women but not
men. Data from the Women’s Interagency HIV Study indicate that between 12-24% of WWH report unhealthy
alcohol use, defined as >7 drinks/week or >3 drinks/occasion. In addition, studies have documented that
polysubstance use—concurrent use of alcohol and at least one other substance (e.g., tobacco, stimulants,
cocaine, opioids)—is increasingly common among WWH. It is critical to focus on WWH because the
consequences of alcohol consumption for women are greater than those of men at lower levels and shorter
duration of alcohol use. WWH tend to have poorer ART adherence and viral suppression than men with HIV.
Among WWH that receive ART, excessive alcohol use has been found to result in decreased ART adherence
and viral load increases in a dose-response fashion. As a modifiable influence on HIV care continuum targets,
alcohol and polysubstance use vulnerability appears to have greater impacts on HIV and clinical outcomes
among WWH than among men with HIV. Thus, to achieve more sustainable and equitable reductions in
excessive alcohol and polysubstance use, it is important to identify upstream factors within neighborhoods that
can be targeted to achieve significant population health gains among WWH. Recent research has highlighted
the significance of environmental factors influencing substance use and health outcomes for WWH. Therefore,
it is important to explore potential community environmental factors such as the density of alcohol outlets given
that some of the most important determinants of alcohol and polysubstance use are at the community level.
 The specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) Longitudinally quantify both the direct and indirect effects
of alcohol outlet density on alcohol consumption and polysubstance use, and HIV care continuum outcomes
(engagement with care, being on ART, ART adherence, and viral load suppression) among WWH, and assess
whether associations differ by race/ethnicity, and (2) Explore, using semi-structured in-depth interviews, the
experiences and perceptions of WWH about how alcohol outlets influence their alcohol and polysubstance use
behaviors and HIV care. This work is innovative because it will be the first study to investigate the longitudinal
association between alcohol outlet density and HIV care continuum outcomes in the United States. This
proposal is significant because it focuses on how disproportionate exposure to alcohol outlets may adversely
play a role in the racial health disparities seen among WWH. The long-term goal of this research is to inform
the implementation of evidence-based alcohol policies to improve the health of WWH."
10999581,"The International Society for Experimental Hematology’s (ISEH) 53rd Annual Scientific Meeting
will be held 29 August – 01 September 2024 at the Sheraton Grand Chicago in Chicago, IL.
Through this R13 application, ISEH seeks support for young investigator attendance and
participation in its 2024 scientific meeting.
Our scientific program highlights talks on basic, translational and clinical hematology. The
meeting is structured to include one day of pre-meeting workshops for PhD students,
postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty, followed by three days of world-leading scientific talks
and networking activities for all attendees. Scientific talks include a combination of invited
speakers and oral abstract presentations featuring the latest scientific achievements and
unpublished research. The ISEH Scientific Programming Committee intentionally includes
world-renowned scientists, while also providing opportunities for the field’s rising stars to present
for the first time at an international scientific meeting, developing future scientists.
In addition to the science, the size and setting of the ISEH meeting creates unmatchable
networking opportunities connecting young investigators with prestigious senior faculty to
meaningfully discuss research, techniques, technology, publications, and career opportunities in
a safe, inclusive and welcoming environment. Early career investigators (PhD students,
postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty) accounted for 61% of our attendees in 2023.
Our New Investigators and Junior PI Committees guide the development of these activities
targeted to junior (new) investigators, which is a critical differentiator of the ISEH meeting. In
2024, ISEH will host activities including a pre-meeting workshop, career development sessions
for PhD and Postdocs, a Junior Faculty forum discussion, a new technology session, a
meet-the-experts mixer, a Junior Faculty mixer, as well as featured poster presentations and
oral presentations. Additional support for young investigators participation includes a travel
grant program, in which young investigators can apply for funding to support meeting costs
when submitting an abstract to defray costs of attendance at the meeting.
It is our goal that these activities fulfill ISEH’s mission to promote the scientific knowledge and
clinical application of basic hematology, immunology, stem cell research, cell and gene therapy,
and all related aspects through research, publications, discussion, support of young
investigators and organization of scientific meetings."
10999643,"PROJECT SUMMARY.
A great accomplishment of modern medicine is the increased lifespan of the population worldwide. Unfortunately,
longevity also increased the healthcare burden due to comorbidities of aging such as atherosclerotic cardio-
vascular disease (CVD). Overwhelming evidence indicates that hyperlipidemia is a main driver of CVD, which
promotes an inflammatory response by vasculature-resident macrophages. Other inflammatory cells, chiefly
among them T-cells, are also recruited to growing plaques and play a fundamental role in their remodeling and
susceptibility to rupture. In women, it is well recognized that loss of ovarian hormones at menopause is an
independent risk factor for cardiovascular events. Current therapies, such as statins, lower circulating LDL-
cholesterol and have been clinically demonstrated to decrease mortality in the elderly. Yet, despite the use of
statins for over five decades, atherosclerosis still remains the leading cause of death in men and women globally.
These observations indicate that 1) there are additional, yet unidentified, lipid-independent mechanisms that
contribute to atheroprogression and plaque rupture; and 2) additional therapies are needed to treat ASCVD.
Unpublished preliminary data from our laboratories in mice show that aging in both sexes and loss of estrogen
in females promotes T-cell mediated inflammation. We hypothesize that this age- and menopause-dependent
inflammation exacerbates underlying CVD such that further lowering cholesterol does not provide added benefit.
Here we will test the idea that promoting an anti-inflammatory, pro-resolving environment in the plaque is
atheroprotective. To accomplish this, we will use treat mice with pulsed low-dose RANKL (pRL), which we show
induces plaque resident regulatory CD8+FoxP3+CD25+CTLA4+ T-cells that secrete IL-10. If successful, pRL will
be a novel therapeutic for treating ASCVD, that works by mechanism distinct from therapies currently in use.
Additionally, the proposed studies will deliver two key innovations. First, we will compare atheromata in young
(2-month-old) and old (18-month-old at beginning of intervention, corresponding to ~60-year-old human) male
and female mice. Second, old females will be ovariectomized to mimic human menopause. Thus, in females we
will segregate the effects of aging and menopause on plaque development. We will comprehensively map
athero-prone proximal aorta transcriptomic profiles at a single-cell resolution, focusing on inflammatory cell
clusters, cell-to-cell communication networks, T-cell-mediated dysfunction of smooth muscle cells and
endothelial cells, markers linked to plaque stability/vulnerability, and transcripts encoding predicted secreted
proteins (secretome). The integrated mechanistic data obtained with our unprecedented discovery approach will
have a lasting impact in the field of vascular physiology and pathology because most published murine
atherosclerosis studies have systematically ignored the effects of age, sex, and hormonal status, despite most
CVD patients being older (and post-menopausal). Overall, these outcomes will be the foundation for future
mechanistic studies and may identify novel plaque-secreted biomarkers to assess disease severity."

Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) are common and increasing
across the world. Black and low-income populations have an even higher risk of AD/ADRD than other
populations, but despite this higher risk these populations have been less studied. Recently, new anti-amyloid
medications have demonstrated impressive amyloid clearance from the brain and improvements in key
dementia outcomes. However, significant adverse events have been demonstrated in all trials. Further,
diagnostic, monitoring, delivery, transportation, and financial burdens also exist and may be particularly
problematic for Black and low-income populations. Therefore, there is a critical need to better understand the
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of anti-amyloid medications in Black, low-income populations.
In the R61 Planning Phase, we will engage stakeholders and establish the theoretical framework to conduct
the remaining analyses. Specifically, during Aim 1, we will use a mixed methods approach to better understand
the preferences and factors affecting real-world effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in Flint, Michigan
(predominantly Black and/or low-income). Qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys will be performed in
those with mild cognitive impairment and AD with a focus on diagnostic, monitoring, delivery, transportation,
and financial burden (out-of-pocket costs). During Aim 2, we will determine utilization, costs, adherence, and
real-world adverse event rates of anti-amyloid medication in Black, low-income populations using healthcare
claims datasets representing those with Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine
the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of anti-amyloid medications in Black, low-income populations by using
the information obtained in Aims 1 and 2. Monte Carlo simulation methods will be used to estimate outcomes
in a simulated population derived from data on AD incidence and mortality.
The proposed aims will improve our understanding of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the new anti-
amyloid medications in Black, low-income populations. This information has the potential to lead to
interventions to improve cost-effectiveness, which could focus on improving effectiveness and/or reducing
costs. We will also have the ability to determine whether healthcare disparities exist by comparing utilization
between Black, low-income populations to other populations."

The purpose of this application is secure funding for a 5-year period to support travel awards to enable
US-based registrants from diverse backgrounds that are selected in an equitable manner to attend the
Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) annual Developmental Origins of Health and Disease
(DOHaD) Summer Course, which is held the first week of August each year at OHSU. The target
demographic is graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and early career investigators who have a
primary interest in the fundamentals and the latest advances in the DOHaD field, but who may not have
the resources to attend the week-long course. Attendance will further provide the opportunity for them to
interact with leaders in the DOHaD field and each other, thus fostering connections among the next
generation of scientists and leaders. The long-term objective is to continue to expand DOHaD and
placental-related research nationally, develop interactive collaborative networks in this field, and support
the development of early career scientists. The meeting will feature lectures from OHSU faculty
members who work in the DOHaD area, that cover the fundamental principles and cutting edge work in
thematic areas (e.g. cardiovascular, neurodevelopment) relevant to DOHaD. On day one, a “connections
corner-like” event will allow attendees to interact with each other and faculty. Attendees will be assigned a
mentor for the meeting and will take part in an experimental design challenge where they will design
specific aims and experiments to address a research question for presentation at the end of the
conference. In addition, all registrants are required to submit an abstract describing their own work for
poster presentation on day two of the meeting. The R13 funded travel awards will be selected by a
competitive review of these abstracts by the organizing committee and ranked according to clarity and
content. During award selection, the committee will give special regard to representation of minorities
and claims for financial support. In addition, this grant will sponsor one Keynote lecture by an
accomplished scientist outside of our institution to provide attendees with state-of-the-art perspective on
a leading issue in DOHaD. This will be an individual who is not necessarily a DOHaD scientist, but is
clearly a leader in an area that has relevance to DOHaD (e.g. angiogenesis, apoptosis, cancer biology).
This Keynote Speaker will serve as a focal point for a plenary session and workshop in that area. This
individual will be designated the NIH-Lecturer at each meeting."

The 2024 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Optics and Photonics in Medicine and Biology (OPMB),
continues the long and rich history of inspiring and educating current and future generations of
interdisciplinary scientists and engineers, and is one of the highest rated GRC meetings indicating the quality
of the program and the inclusive community. This conference,which began in 1965, is respected as one of the
premiere meetings for fostering creative research and ideas in biophotonics (science and engineering of
light, lasers and optical technologies as it applies to medicine and biology).
The primary objective of this meeting is to bring together researchers from academia, hospitals and
medical clinics, national laboratories, and industry to understand and advance the use of light, lasers, and
optical technologies in clinical care, as well as fundamental biological discovery. The conference specific
aims are (1) to foster scientific exchange among researchers at the cutting-edge of biophotonics, from
academic and clinical institutions, government laboratories, and industrial enterprises; (2) to integrate
fundamental discovery, technological innovation and research applications spanning basic biology and
biophysics to clinical medicine throughout the meeting; and (3) to strengthen and renew our international
community of researchers by promoting a personal level of interactions between senior and junior faculty,
post-doctoral fellows, research scientists, and graduate students in an informal environment, while ensuring
diversity in gender, race, and culture. To enhance the participation of graduate students and postdoctoral
fellows at the conference, we will continue the hugely successful Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on OPMB,
a forum organized by students and postdocs for their peers, that was started at the 2018 GRC.
The 2024 conference will focus on connecting fundamental (bio)physical discovery and understanding to the
development of novel optical technologies and applying these principles and technological advances to human
physiology and clinical applications. This conference will bring together an outstanding and diverse group of
scientists at the forefront of biophotonics research to stimulate discussion and exchange ideas. All speakers
are encouraged to present new, unpublished research in the tradition of the “off the record” policy of the GRC.
The intimate environment provides a unique experience for researchers across all levels to engage in scientific
discussions and networking.
The objective of the conference is well aligned with the mission of the NIH to advance knowledge and enable
creative discoveries of living systems to reduce disease and improve health. This proposal requests funding to
support the registration and travel costs of early career investigators, post-docs, and graduate students to
attend the GRC and GRS to be held at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine."
11006718,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Fatigue is a common debilitating symptom that inhibits activity and functional recovery in hospitalized older
adults. While clinicians consider treating fatigue to mitigate its adverse effects, there are no data to guide them
on the comparative effects of different interventions. This is in part because fatigue is a subjective self-reported
symptom that does not account for patient’s activity level. This is a critical limitation since fatigue and activity
influence each other, and interventions that reduce fatigue may increase activity, which in turn may offset initial
reductions in fatigue. As a result, trials measuring fatigue only will miss important changes in patient activity, and
incompletely estimate the effect of the intervention. A solution to this problem is to measure patient’s fatigue in
the context of activity, a measure known as fatigability. Fatigability describes the level of fatigue a patient
experiences at any given activity level, and measuring fatigability in hospitalized older adults would be useful for:
1) identifying patients at high risk for functional decline because their fatigue is inhibiting activity, 2) estimating
the effect of interventions on changes in fatigue and/or activity, and 3) monitoring longitudinal changes in fatigue
and/or activity during hospitalization and after discharge. However, currently available fatigability measures are
costly and difficult to operationalize in the inpatient setting (treadmill testing, 6-minute walk), or have been poorly
validated using rudimentary statistical methods. The proposed research will address these limitations by building
and validating the Computerized Adaptive Test-Fatigability (CAT-F), using multidimensional item response
theory (MIRT) to improve the precision, accuracy, and rapidity by which clinicians and scientists can measure
fatigability in hospitalized older adults. Aim 1 will apply MIRT to previously collected self-reported fatigability,
fatigue, and activity data from hospitalized older adults to develop an adaptive fatigability test that has increased
precision while using fewer items compared to currently available fatigability measurement methods. Aim 2 will
validate the CAT-F against the current gold standard measures of fatigability in a subset of 75 hospitalized older
adults. Future phase 2 work will integrate the validated CAT-F into the EHR at the University of Chicago Medical
Center, pilot the CAT-F in a sample of clinicians and patients that are part of an ongoing study of hospitalized
older adults, and refine the CAT-F based on user feed-back and additional data collected. Innovation and
impact: The CAT-F will integrate data from multiple domains (fatigue and activity) to measure a common latent
variable (fatigability) that has significant downstream clinical consequences in hospitalized older adults. The
CAT-F will directly improve clinical care by providing clinically relevant information at the point of care through
the EHR for clinicians to access and act on, and will increase the efficiency of conducting studies and trials of
interventions aimed at reducing fatigue and/or increasing activity. As a result, the CAT-F will improve the care
and outcomes of hospitalized older adults, and advance the science of fatigue through efficient high-quality
measurement and data generation that informs the optimal treatment strategies for fatigue."
11006721,"Abstract
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a rapidly progressing lung disease with no known cure. This therapeutic
gap partly reflects the failure of current drug discovery technologies. A common weakness is that they do not
provide a holistic assessment of a drug, largely due to the lack of direct evaluation of physiological endpoints
relevant to patient wellbeing. Thus, drug candidates can potentially be missed, or hits might ultimately have little
impact on patient wellbeing. We propose that parenchymal stiffness, a physical characteristic of tissue, is a
suitable target. The reason is that lung stiffness governs ventilation at the macroscale and can drive cellular
behaviors that promote and amplify IPF at the microscale. To measure macro- and micro-scale stiffness, we
have recently invented a biomechanical method suitable for implementation in human precision cut lung slices
(hPCLS). Using this method, our preliminary results show that the median and variance of IPF hPCLS stiffness
was ~3 and 30-fold greater than healthy hPCLS, respectively. Empowered by this data, our central hypothesis
is that the hPCLS stiffness map is well suited to evaluate whether a drug can therapeutically reduce, preemptively
slow, and/or stop IPF progression. To test this hypothesis, we seek to: 1) integrate micro- with macro-scale
stiffness measurements with traditional IPF discovery endpoints, and 2) demonstrate proof-of-concept in testing
the therapeutic and preventive capabilities of IPF drugs. Aim 1: To establish that hPCLS stiffness can be used
to evaluate the therapeutic capability of IPF drugs. We will achieve this by (1) improving stiffness maps to
associate local stiffness with specific alveolar structures, and (2) correlating alveolar stiffening with microscale
remodeling of alveolar architecture, collagen microstructure, and alpha smooth muscle actin. The measurements
will be obtained before and 5 days after treating IPF-derived hPCLS with Nintedanib that reduces type III collagen
production or Epigallocatechin Gallate that inhibits both lysyl oxidase (LOX, collagen cross-linking enzyme) and
transforming growth factor β1 (TGF β1) kinase. Aim 2: To establish that hPCLS stiffness can be used to evaluate
the preventive capability of IPF drugs. A key advantage of our approach is the ability to perform longitudinal and
noninvasive assessment of hPCLS stiffness. We will take advantage of this unique capability to monitor
spatiotemporal evolution of macro- and micro-scale stiffness together with fibrillar collagen deposition of each
hPCLS over 7 days, in the presence or absence of a well-established pro-fibrotic cocktail. The experiments will
be repeated after co-treating normal hPCLS samples with either Nintedanib or Epigallocatechin Gallate. Impacts:
In this phase I application, we will develop a stiffness-based IPF drug discovery platform. In a Phase II follow-
up, we will: 1) integrate the MechanoWell® with state-of-the-art multiomic approaches to better understand and
fine tune promising drug candidates, and 2) stride toward commercialization via beta testing at potential industry
and academic partner sites."
11006980,"PRJECT SUMMARY
 Fast evolution of blockbuster biologics such as monoclonal antibodies, antibody drug conjugates,
fusion proteins, and gene therapy, is creating a strong demand for efficient analytical tools to characterize
and monitor product variants that could negatively impact safety and efficacy. During production in cell
culture, formulation, and storage, protein therapeutics can undergo post-translational modifications that
could lead to charge variants (CVs). CVs are product variants with a net charge different from that of the
intended product. The International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for
Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidelines identify CVs as a critical quality attribute because of their
potential impact on the quality, safety, and efficacy of the product. Also, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration guidance recommends a comprehensive characterization of CVs in regulatory submissions.
As a result, analytical monitoring of CVs is routine in product and process development, quality control
and lot release.
 In the biopharmaceutical industry (biopharma), there is a growing interest in characterizing CVs
with native mass spectrometry (MS) to ascertain the underlying post-translational modifications and
potentially correlate with biological functions. For CVs characterization at the intact protein level, efficient
separation is a critical step before MS detection to separate the variants, reduce sample complexity, and
allow the detection of low abundant species. The most widely used separation techniques for CVs analysis
in biopharma are (imaged) capillary isoelectric focusing and ion exchange chromatography but their
applications for CVs characterization in native state are limited due to either inadequate resolution or
incompatible separation conditions.
 GMJ Technologies (GMJ) is developing a high-resolution native capillary zone electrophoresis with
native mass spectrometry for CVs characterization. Our approach combines multiple innovative solutions
in capillary surface chemistry that produces high resolution of CVs by capillary zone electrophoresis, a
novel optical-electrospray interface that provides inline optical and native mass detections, and a sensitive
nanoflow electrospray mechanism that preserves proteins’ native conformation. With this innovation,
GMJ aims to address a gap in the characterization and quality control of protein therapeutics from
research to commercialization. By eliminating several laborious steps, the proposed technique will
significantly improve the efficiency in the characterization workflow for CVs, improve the analysis
precision and sensitivity, provide cost-saving benefits, and contribute to development and manufacturing
of novel biologics and protein-based medicines."
10976376,"PROJECT SUMMARY. The eye offers a unique and relatively unexplored area to study Alzheimer’s disease
and related dementias (ADRD). The overarching goal of the Eye Adult Changes in Thought (Eye ACT) study is
to further scientific understanding of aging brains by characterizing aging eyes in exquisite detail with
prospective collection of non-invasive visual function and retinal imaging data while analyzing decades of
extant eye clinical data. Eye ACT leverages infrastructure and resources from the parent ACT study that has
enrolled and biennially followed dementia-free older adults since 1994. As of 11/2022, total enrollment through
all waves is 5,763 with ~24,000 biennial visits, 49,000 person-years of follow-up, 1,450 dementia cases, and
1,200 Alzheimer’s cases. The ACT study provides a well characterized cohort that combines research quality
evaluations of cognition, ADRD, and autopsy (>1,000 cases to date) with an unprecedented eye clinical data.
 Eye ACT’s recruitment rate has been >95% to date with >500 completed baseline visits. Under the U19
Program, the ACT study is expanding from 2000 to 3000 active participants, specifically targeting racial/ethnic
diversity. Over 59% of new enrollees since Covid are racial/ethnic minorities. Eye ACT will leverage this
opportunity to grow in its size and diversity in this cycle. In Cycle 1, we extracted clinical eye data from >4,500
participants with manual extraction of paper records through 2003 and in-house natural language processing
algorithms for extracting ~80,000 clinic visits since 2003. We also extracted >18,000 clinical retinal images. We
used these data to develop lifetime eye disease severity models we will leverage in this cycle.
 We will focus on vascular disease and visual impairment (VI) as potential mechanisms for associations
between AD and eye diseases. In Aim 1, we will evaluate longitudinal retinal imaging and visual function data
from Eye ACT participants while fully integrating home research study visits. We will determine whether
structural and vascular retinal features are associated with cognitive decline. We will test whether VI is a
causal mediator of eye disease-AD risk associations. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the severity of multiple eye
diseases as predictors of microinfarcts and ADRD neuropathology findings. We will investigate whether VI or
eye diseases modify cognitive resilience. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel data curation and sharing platform
for making extensive (“big”) ophthalmic imaging data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR),
propelling artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) research. We will perform a proof-of-concept
federated learning study to share AI/ML models without sharing data themselves and validate model results.
 Eye ACT represents a unique opportunity to obtain state of the art ophthalmic data collection in a
uniquely well characterized and increasingly diverse cohort of older adults followed longitudinally; consenting
participants donate their brains at death for additional brain tissue-based data collection. Eye ACT promises to
substantially enhance scientific understanding of links between aging eyes, aging brains, and ADRD."
10977779,"PROJECT SUMMARY
For the more than 200,000 women who develop hormone receptor positive breast cancer yearly, endocrine
therapy for at least five years reduces cancer recurrence by nearly 50% and increases overall survival. Yet
almost half of patients prescribed endocrine therapy fail to take all their pills. Education and reminder-based
studies in this and other clinical settings have had disappointingly small effects on adherence, and more
complex interventions have proven difficult to sustain. In this proposal, we focus on the pain, menopausal, and
other symptoms that women describe as major barriers to endocrine therapy adherence. We have drawn on
two complementary sets of research findings: first, trials in chemotherapy settings recently reported that routine
symptom monitoring and management can improve a number of outcomes, including survival; and second,
research from non-oncologic chronic care settings has shown that a number of outcomes can be improved with
outreach to high-risk patients by nonphysician providers in between physician visits. We propose an
intervention targeting high-risk patients who already have poor adherence to endocrine therapy. In a
randomized study, we will routinely collect patient-reported symptom data from patients. Clinical pharmacy
teams will support patients to manage symptoms and address other barriers so they can continue daily
medications. The primary objective of the study is to improve adherence, with specific aims as follows: Aim 1:
Assess the impact of symptom monitoring and management with clinical pharmacist led follow-up (the
intervention) on patient adherence to oral endocrine therapy. We will assess the impact of a 12-month
intervention on adherence and evaluate adherence again at 24 months to assess intervention durability. Aim
2: Describe the impact of the intervention on symptoms. We will model the average trajectories of patient-
reported outcomes over time by study group. We will also model symptoms by adherence level since side
effects may increase if adherence increases. Aim 3: Explore the impact of the intervention on potential
mechanisms for improvement of adherence. We will use mediation analysis to examine the relationships
between the intervention and proposed mechanisms including 1) baseline symptom severity 2) self-efficacy to
manage medications and symptoms, 3) team communication with the patient, and 4) social support. If
successful, this study has the potential to improve care for thousands of women. Many newly approved
oncologic medications are oral agents, so this intervention would also be an important model for other
conditions and could inform the design of oncologic care delivery."

The olfactory epithelium is the peripheral organ for smell, housing millions of primary olfactory sensory
neurons. Insults such as inflammation, infection, toxins or trauma can damage the olfactory epithelium and
perturb olfactory function, causing lasting anosmia, hyposmia or parosmia. We lack both a basic understanding
of what goes wrong when people lose their sense of smell, and effective therapies for sensorineural olfactory
disorders, as highlighted by our current inability to treat post-COVID olfactory dysfunction impacting millions of
people. Thus, there is an urgent unmet need to define mechanisms driving olfactory neuronal homeostasis and
dysfunction in humans. In rodents, each olfactory neuron harbors a unique transcriptome based upon the
singular olfactory receptor it expresses, organized into coherent gene expression programs. Fixed gene
expression programs specify each neuron’s identity, and flexible programs are dynamically adjusted based
upon odor exposure. These findings have enabled genome-wide characterization of odor responses in vivo in
mice, across the entire olfactory neuron population. However, humans express far fewer olfactory receptors
than mice, and neither their specific receptive odor repertoire nor their dynamic in vivo transcriptional variation
have been well-defined. Unlike in rodents, we know little about how gene expression is organized in human
olfactory neurons, how populations of human olfactory neurons respond to defined odors, or how odor-evoked
olfactory neuron activity is altered in the setting of disease. The experiments proposed here will identify
organized patterns of gene expression in olfactory neurons isolated from human biopsies, in both controls and
in subjects with objective smell loss, via two specific aims: Specific Aim 1 will establish the axes of
transcriptional variation in human OSNs; Specific Aim 2 will assess responses to odor at the single cell level in
the human olfactory epithelium. Olfactory mucosal biopsies from normosmic or hyposmic subjects will be
analyzed using single cell RNA-sequencing. Presenting a specific odorant to subjects prior to biopsy and
sequencing, an approach termed Act-seq will be employed to query the responses of the entire olfactory
neuron array to a given odor in vivo. Act-seq will be compared from normosmic or post-Covid hyposmic
olfactory samples. Completion of the proposed work will (1) directly define human odor-induced alterations in
olfactory cells in normal or diseased conditions, (2) provide the first in vivo human olfactory receptor de-
orphanization, and (3) produce novel datasets that will be broadly useful to the neurobiology and
chemosensory research communities. These results, defining mechanisms driving olfactory neuronal
homeostasis and dysfunction in humans, will form a basis for future clinical research trials aimed at promoting
recovery of olfaction."

Hearing impairment in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) may contribute to core ASD symptoms
by interfering with language development and communication. The number of individuals with ASD or other
neurodevelopmental disorders is growing rapidly, thus studies are urgently needed to address how and to what
extent auditory system deficits are associated with ASD-like behaviors. Mounting evidence supports the
hypothesis that peripheral auditory system deficits reflective in auditory nerve dysfunction may contribute to the
pathophysiological changes observed at the cortical level (e.g., hyperacusis or other auditory processing
deficiencies). However, the lack of mechanistic studies using translational animal models of ASD with well-
characterized auditory functional impairments is a critical barrier to uncovering potential relationships and
causal links between structural and functional auditory deficits and ASD-related behaviors. Mutations or
deletions in the Myocyte-specific Enhancer Factor 2C (MEF2C) gene have been linked to ASD and other
neurodevelopmental disorders in humans. Our recent studies using a mouse model of human MEF2C
haploinsufficiency syndrome (MCHS) revealed that Mef2c deficiency leads to altered neural activity in the
cortex, increased microglial activation, and deficits in communication, social interaction, and other MCHS
symptoms that are characteristic of ASD. Using this mouse model, our studies also show (1) that Mef2c may
play a role in the development and function of spiral ganglion neurons of the auditory nerve and regulation of
cochlear macrophage activity, (2) an important association between Mef2c deficiency and auditory nerve
dysfunction, and (3) that Mef2c deficiency leads to cortical neural dysfunction in response to auditory stimuli.
Together these exciting data support the hypothesis that ASD risk-gene MEF2C deficiency in spiral ganglion
neurons and macrophages can lead to auditory nerve dysfunction and increased macrophage activation, which
in turn contributes to auditory cortical dysfunction and core symptoms of ASD. This multiple PI proposal will
test this novel hypothesis using a multidisciplinary approach. The proposed experiments will characterize
unique temporal and spatial expression patterns of Mef2c in both spiral ganglion neurons and cochlear
macrophages that are associated with auditory nerve development and maintenance (Aim 1), determine the
causal links between Mef2c deficiency-induced auditory nerve dysfunction and auditory cortical dysfunction,
and core symptoms of ASD (Aim 2), and test the extent to which inhibition of abnormal macrophage activation
ameliorates auditory nerve dysfunction, auditory cortical dysfunction, and core ASD symptoms (Aim 3). These
investigations will promote a greater understanding of the important role of immune cells and auditory system
deficits in ASD and possible other neurodevelopmental disorders and may reveal a neuro-immune-based
therapeutic strategy beneficial for this increasingly common disorder."
10977528,"Project Summary
Natural products produced by bacteria are a critical resource for discovery of new therapeutics. Synthetic biology
approaches such as heterologous expression of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) have leveraged growing
capabilities to assume molecular details of natural products produced by sequenced bacteria from genetic data.
Methodologies for heterologous expression of BGCs from Streptomyces spp. have benefited from incredible
progress and enabled continued discovery of biologically active metabolites from Gram-positive actinobacteria.
However, comparatively fewer synthetic biology techniques are available to other groups of bacteria known to
be reliable sources of therapeutic leads. Myxobacteria are considered the Gram-negative reciprocal to
actinobacteria when describing gifted producers of natural products that have large genomes replete with BGCs.
More importantly, metabolites discovered from myxobacteria occupy chemical space unique from actinobacterial
metabolites. The long-term objection of this proposal is to increase the synthetic biology toolset available for
natural products discovery from myxobacteria. Expanding the number of heterologous host chassis beyond the
lone host Myxococcus xanthus and developing novel strategies to generate host platforms will afford alternative
approaches to utilize BGCs for natural products discovery. We aim to: 1) assess alternative myxobacterial
plasmids and heterologous hosts, 2) develop a predator-prey model system to observe horizontal transfer of
BGCs and explore predation-based methods to engineer heterologous hosts, and 3) apply developed
myxobacterial tools to enable discovery of novel bacterial metabolites. Successful completion of proposed
research will expand synthetic biology tools suited for discovery of natural products and increase investigation
of myxobacterial metabolites with antibacterial, antifungal, cytotoxic, antiviral, and immunosuppressive activities.
Sustained access to natural products from bacteria benefits human health by providing therapeutic leads,
increasing biosynthetic discoveries, and enabling subsequent clinical pharmacology."

10977692,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Tier 1 bio-weapon and global health threats Francisella tularensis and Burkholderia pseudomallei exploit
the intracellular alveolar macrophage, and have evolved sophisticated immunomodulatory escape mechanisms.
New therapeutic strategies are badly needed against these highly lethal and progressively antibiotic resistant
agents. This project will identify new host-directed immune therapeutic strategies that can work with
macrophage-targeted polymeric prodrugs to overcome these bacterial infections, or prophylactically reduce their
disease impact. The polymeric prodrugs achieve these new drug activities by providing targeted and sustained
antibiotic pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles within the intracellular lung macrophage compartment, and across whole
lung by diffusion. They would potentially allow multi-day efficacy after single administrations with distributable
inhalation devices, key advantages for biodefense and global health settings where oral antibiotic adherence is
a key issue. Immune-therapy has provided exciting new drug strategies for cancer and other infectious diseases.
Here, we aim to identify and exploit host-directed immune modulators that are co-targeted to the lung
macrophage reservoir with antibiotic polymeric prodrugs. This combination drug approach is critical in their
biodefense settings, where it would often be unknown immediately whether Francisella or Burkholderia was the
causative agent. The identification of drug combinations that could work against both is thus essential, and
potent host-directed and anti-bacterial activities are likely both needed for symptomatic patient therapy. This
project will identify which immune modulators work best against Francisella versus Burkholderia, and especially
to identify which immune therapeutics and antibiotics can work effectively against both pathogens. The proposal
is structured around 3 specific aims: (1) Develop a panel of host-directed immune modulators as polymeric
prodrug candidates that exploit the lung macrophage as a reservoir to focus intracellular drug delivery and to
achieve extended dosing pharmacokinetics. (2) Identify promising immune-modulatory pathways and optimize
therapeutic and prophylactic activities in ABSL2 aerosolized F. novicida and B. thailandensis mouse models.
Favorable immune modulating drugs will be tested with a potent ciprofloxacin polymeric prodrug for combination
drug selection. (3) Assess and optimize the up-selected polymeric prodrugs combining host-directed immune
modulators and antibiotics against the ABSL3 aerosolized Francisella tularensis and Burkholderia pseudomallei
rodent disease models. If successful, this platform may offer new host-drug combination strategies for other
pulmonary infections. This platform also meets requirements for rapid development against future pulmonary
threats, including antibiotic resistant threats. The polymeric prodrugs have a favorable manufacturing and cost-
of-goods-sold profile to provide a favorable pathway to first-in-human trials. ."

Alcohol misuse is a significant public health issue leading to serious consequences including alcohol use
disorder and numerous alcohol-related morbidities. Research has linked increasing levels of alcohol
consumption to more than 60 disease conditions. Alcohol consumption is also associated with a broad range of
adverse health and social consequences one of which is interpersonal violence. There are also notable alcohol
and violence-related health disparities among individuals from minoritized groups, distinguished by race,
ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, refugee status, and intersectionality. To promote health equity,
interventions should target multiple levels of the social ecology as inequities often originate from higher-level
societal constructs, such as systemic oppression and social determinants; however, most alcohol and violence
prevention studies have targeted one level; seldom is there a focus beyond the individual or on specific health
disparity groups. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism prioritizes addressing alcohol-related
health disparities, underscoring the immediate need to train a new wave of prevention scientists. These
experts should be adept at developing interventions that span various levels of the social ecology and target
populations most vulnerable. Their training should embody a holistic public health perspective, ensuring they
can define problems, pinpoint risk factors, devise prevention measures, roll out strategies on a broad scale,
and assess impact. This calls for an interdisciplinary training approach focused on the development and testing
of multilevel interventions and with an examination of effects across intersecting identities. Supported by 20
faculty, the proposed comprehensive pre-doctoral training program (A-PREVENT) encompasses seven training
components (coursework, independent research projects, conferences, T32 meetings, community-engaged
research, lecture series, and a F31 independent research project) providing intensive and comprehensive
research training in three areas: 1) health equity; 2) designing and implementing multi-level interventions to
address the intersection of alcohol and violence prevention as well as its associated co-morbidities; and 3)
innovative methodological and statistical approaches to assess efficacy across multiple levels of the social-
ecological model. A-PREVENT will equip a diverse cohort of new prevention researchers with the
methodological acumen capable of transformative advances in health equity, and enabling the formulation of
solutions that are both pragmatic and pioneering in addressing health disparities. This advanced, integrated,
and innovative training program will not only diversify the biomedical research workforce with our trainees from
diverse backgrounds, but also prepare them to develop and evaluate multi-level preventive interventions that
address significant health disparities. We are seeking 6 funded slots, each with 4-5 years of funding, for pre-
doctoral students in 2 programs (Public Health and Clinical Psychology)."
10992569,"Project Summary/ Abstract
Our long-term objective is to improve the efficacy and safety of liver cancer transarterial embolization through
new computational tools that enable the development of new personalized treatment strategies. The
continued rising mortality and incidence make research on improving liver cancer management essential.
Transarterial embolization is used to obstruct the tumor blood flow (TAE) and deliver localized radiation
(yttrium-90 radioembolization 90Y TARE) or chemotherapy (chemoembolization TACE). 90Y TARE counted
for more than 10,000 interventions in the US in 2022. Demonstrated benefits for patients include increased
time to progression but moderate improvement of overall survival, in part because it is only used as second
or third line treatment on advanced cancers. Recent 90Y TARE clinical trials showed a correlation between
the tumor dose and patient outcome, indicating that robust and precise targeting must be pursued. Targeting
is however complex, highly patient-dependent, and difficult to plan with current imaging techniques. This
leads physicians to underdose 90Y TARE to limit liver toxicity, missing the tumoricidal dose of ~50 in 80% of
patients. TAE and TACE are performed with a fixed dosage and also frequently fail: post treatment imaging
shows residual blood flow in ~70% of tumors treated with TACE, indicative of incomplete occlusion of the
tumor blood supply. If the efficacy and safety profile of TAE were improved through better planning, it could
have a much higher impact on patient outcome, helping patients at earlier stages and reducing mortality.
Tools to develop such treatment planning currently lack robustness and accuracy. This U01 proposal follows
the concept of a liver digital twin to develop an in silico platform to optimize liver transarterial embolization.
Tumor targeting is achieved by selecting the injection points and dosage; it remains mostly empirical based
on pretreatment vascular imaging with limited robustness. We propose a novel personalized treatment
planning using a liver digital twin that builds on our previous work developing CFDose, a simulation pipeline
based on computational fluid dynamics and physics modeling informed with patient CT images. CFDose
predicts the liver dose through blood flow simulation using standard-of-care imaging, requiring no changes
to the clinical workflow. We will use it as a building block to develop patient-specific in silico optimization of
TAE, TARE, and TACE. The algorithm will sample the injection point and dosage, simulate the dose or drug
concentration distribution (activating the liver model multiple times), and compare it with the physician’s
target. The project will develop the patient-specific virtual liver model to simulate the distribution, will
accelerate the simulation with artificial intelligence (GANs), and will integrate the liver model into an
optimization algorithm. The virtual liver model acts a digital twin of the patient’s liver to assist TAE planning.
There is a dire need for predictive multiphysics and multiscale liver models that include blood flow, a major
component of liver disease. Our digital twin liver can fill this gap for liver cancer."

The rich, diverse, and complementary multimodal datasets provided by the Common Fund Data Ecosystem's
(CFDE) Data Coordinating Centers (DCCs) provide exciting opportunities for integrative analysis and
exploration. Here, we propose a systematic data visualization-driven approach to investigate the model-based
predictions of the target genes of candidate cis regulatory elements (cCREs). Our project will leverage
biomolecular data from key repositories in the CFDE, including the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)
project, the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP), the Cellular Senescence Network (SenNet), and
the 4D Nucleome (4DN) consortium, and will expand to include genomic data from external large projects
such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project. Our motivating use case is the integrative
exploration and validation of predictions for target genes of cCREs in the context of relevant linkage
disequilibrium (LD), molecular quantitative trait loci (QTLs), epigenomic, transcriptomic, (spatial and
non-spatial) single-cell, and Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C/Hi-C) data. Central to this objective are
(1) a ﬂexible data management system tailormade for visualization that addresses the challenges of organizing
private and federated public datasets, (2) tools for the creation of custom, interactive exploratory
visualizations, and (3) the ability to save and share visualizations in a FAIR manner. To achieve our goals, we
will develop the Common Fund Visualization Hub, a cloud-based platform enabling uniﬁed access to data
resources in the CFDE alongside user-contributed, private data in projects. It will provide a ﬂuid metadata
tagging system that supports structured and unstructured tags. It will support multiscale, genomic
visualization using HiGlass along with a user interface for on-the-ﬂy visualization construction based on the
Gosling visualization grammar. It will also support multimodal data visualization using Vitessce and enhance
reusability through sharing of visualizations and storytelling features to communicate discovery processes.
The Common Fund Visualization Hub will thus facilitate comprehensive data interpretation and
communication through integrative, interactive analysis of diverse genomic and bioimaging datasets. Using
this platform, we will evaluate and compare regulatory element-to-gene predictions from leading machine
learning models based on diﬀerent evidence-based methodologies. By streamlining integrative visualization of
existing CFDE data, our platform aims to help maximize the utility of CFDE investments to accelerate
biomedical discovery. Our platform will empower community members to independently browse, record, and
present their own data combined with data sourced from across the ecosystem, enhancing collaboration and
communication both within and across research groups, as well as with the broader community and the
general public."

The Advanced Methods and Modeling Core (AMMC) is dedicated to advancing cutting-edge methods and
modeling techniques to enhance the understanding of the PATC3H-IN Clinical Research Center (CRC) studies,
which focus on the HIV epidemic among adolescents and young persons. The AMMC aims to synthesize
heterogeneous findings from various strategies, interventions, settings, and populations into a cohesive
framework capable of transforming the course of the epidemic. We recognize that strategies can have varying
effects in different contexts and a central challenge to scientific coordination is weaving together findings from
disparate interventions, settings, and populations. To meet this challenge, we begin with Appreciative Inquiry
— a formal methodology in management science — that “listens” to the careful science already in progress at
each of the eight CRCs in the network and then convenes a participatory process to define, design, and deliver
on shared scientific goals. We will offer support for a range of flexible advanced methods (which are shaped by
the content of the Request for Application as well as reading of existing study designs), but — in the spirit of
co-creation — will continuously evaluate (with surveys and interviews), adapt, and re-design our activities. Our
initial approach is also shaped by the analysis of available information about the projects in the network. We
will draw from a transportability framework for external validity, longitudinal methods like group-based trajectory
modeling, preference methodologies based on economic principles, and systems science, including agent-
based modeling of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. We are positioned to add qualitative evidence
synthesis methods to meet emerging network needs. All methodologies enable connecting findings from
different CRCs (e.g., projecting individual site findings onto shared epidemic dynamics through modeling to be
usable at the onset, the middle, or the end of a trial to enhance opportunities for fit. Operationally, our support
will be delivered through investigator-centered consultations, working groups, and a mini-consortium for
systems science and modeling. The proposed Core will nurture advanced methods and modeling capacities for
implementation science —which are operationally directly salient for adapting, scaling up, and sustaining
evidenced-based interventions. We will ensure our services are user-friendly and catered to PATC3H-IN
investigators, with a focus on early career researchers. The AMMC will work closely with the Capacity
Supporting Core (to inform training in implementation science) and will play a crucial role in interpreting data
generated by the network and informing implementation science, policy, and practice in coordination with the
Community Engagement and Dissemination Core."

Most of the patients with malignant brain cancer or glioblastoma (GBM) do not live more than 20 months despite
highly aggressive treatments, and those who do have a very high probability of tumor recurrence. State-of-the-
art therapeutic strategies that instruct and/or help our body's immune system to fight against malignant cancers
have been recently introduced and hope has been provided by success in clinical studies targeting non-brain
cancers. However, this so-called immunotherapy, particularly checkpoint inhibition, has failed to show
measurable benefits among patients with brain cancers in a number of recent clinical trials. This disappointing
reality is largely attributed to the unique ability of brain cancers to resist immunotherapy or to suppress our
defensive immune system. Specifically, transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) is highly upregulated and plays
pivotal roles in promoting the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in a multi-pronged manner in GBM.
Thus, we hypothesize that TGFβ blockade would mask the tumor immuno-suppression, thereby rescuing
checkpoint inhibition as a viable and potent treatment for GBM. Indeed, the validity and potential impacts of this
combined approach have been preclinically demonstrated in multiple non-brain malignant solid tumors. However,
its realization in GBM is yet to be accomplished due to inability to achieve uniform and robust delivery of TGFβ
inhibitors throughout the brain tumor tissue, including the particularly immunosuppressive hypoxic tumor areas.
The tightly sealed blood-brain barrier (BBB) precludes extravasation of systemically-administered therapy into
the brain tissue. Once beyond the BBB, therapy must percolate the highly dense and adhesive tumor
extracellular matrix to spread throughout the tumor tissue and reach hypoxic tumor regions distanced from blood
vessels. To this end, we propose to develop and evaluate innovative human ferritin protein nanocage-based
delivery platform capable of overcoming these challenging biological barriers for widespread TGFβ blockade
throughout the brain tumor tissue following systemic administration. We recently demonstrated that our prototype
nanocage provides stable systemic circulation, efficient extravasation and tumor uptake, tumor tissue penetration
as well as accumulation in hypoxic tumor regions. In addition, our pilot study shows that the nanocage specifically
designed to carry TGFβ trap provides markedly enhanced ability to block the immunosuppressive TGFβ signaling
in vitro compared to the clinically-relevant anti-TGFβ antibody. We also provide a proof-of-concept evidence
suggesting that this nanocage enhances therapeutic efficacy of a clinically used checkpoint inhibitor in a mouse
model of GBM. We thus expect that TGFβ-antagonizing nanocages to be further developed in this proposal will
dismantle the notoriously immunosuppressive nature of GBM and thus make the otherwise refractory immune
checkpoint inhibition highly efficacious in eradicating malignant tumor tissues from the brain. The proposed
approach, if successful, will provide a breakthrough in treating GBM and potentially other hard-to-cure cancers
as well."

Brain Axis in Alzheimer's Disease-like Neuropathology, investigates the potential link between exposure to
Aspergillus versicolor, a fungal bioaerosol, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) development. The study investigates
A. versicolor exposure in mice and the induction of pulmonary inflammation and immune responses. The
project aims to unravel the underlying mechanisms of these responses, focusing on IL-5, HMGB1, and TREM2
and exploring their roles in the Th2 lung–brain axis. Data show that A. versicolor increases Aβ plaque numbers
and alters plaque-associated TREM2 and microglia in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD. Implications extend to
identifying key mechanisms involved in the lung–brain axis that may contribute to AD development, providing
potential targets for intervention. A comprehensive approach, including genetic modifications and antibody
treatments, explores the proposed connections between environmental exposures and AD pathogenesis.
Requested supports cover research management, including a project manager and admin assistant, and
software tools (Lab Guru, 15/Five). These adjustments are integral to mitigating Dr. Block's recent autoimmune

ConnectedNest, a novel electronic social care referral platform developed by XanthosHealth, addresses the
impact of social determinants of health (SDoH) on individuals facing cancer. Following a successful SBIR
Phase I and a pilot study in collaboration with the Minnesota Cancer Alliance and 14 community-based
organizations (CBOs), Phase II aims to enhance the platform's technical infrastructure, extend integration
capabilities, and conduct a randomized clinical trial involving 300 adults in multi-site oncology clinics. The trial
will assess ConnectedNest's efficacy in connecting individuals with social and community services, improving
quality of life, and influencing factors such as ease of social care access, emergency department utilization,
and patient engagement. The project aligns with public health goals by providing an innovative, cost-effective,
and scalable solution to mitigate SDoH barriers in the cancer care continuum, with potential broader
applications in clinical and community settings. The collaboration with the University of Minnesota underscores
the project's commitment to advancing research in healthcare technology and improving outcomes for
individuals facing cancer.
Under Aim 1, enhancements include the development of user interfaces catering to social workers, community
health workers, and caregivers, alongside the creation of a community advisory board portal for efficient CBO
program management. Efforts to increase accessibility for priority populations and expand the survey
architecture to accommodate electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs) underscore a commitment to
inclusivity and comprehensive data collection.
Aim 2 propels the initiative into a randomized clinical trial involving 300 adults undergoing active cancer
therapy or in survivorship. Patient-reported metrics will be gathered at baseline and days 30, 60, and 90,
including instances of reported social or community needs, connections with services (primary outcome), and
measures of quality of life. The trial also explores secondary outcomes like ease of social care access,
emergency department utilization, and patient engagement, providing a holistic evaluation.
This innovative solution has the potential to serve as a cost-effective and scalable model, enhancing the
capacity to connect individuals with social and community services. Beyond oncology, the project's broader
impact extends to community health settings, aligning with the overarching goal of addressing SDoH barriers
and fostering improved outcomes for individuals facing cancer."

The goal of this Phase II SBIR is to continue development of Gateway Bio’s proprietary alternative for
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) for use as a conjugate to stabilize and increase the circulation half-life of biological
therapeutics. PEG is used in a broad range of products, including biopharmaceuticals and cosmetics, causing
increasing numbers of individuals to develop anti-PEG antibodies. Once established in circulation, anti-PEG
antibodies can interfere with PEGylated therapeutics or trigger an allergic reaction, both of which result in
reduced drug tolerability and efficacy. An urgent unmet need has therefore emerged for PEG-free therapeutics,
requiring new moieties capable of producing the same circulation half-life and stability improvements required
for many biotherapeutics. In response to this need, Gateway Bio has developed poly(oligoethylene glycol methyl
methacrylate) (POEGMA), which has short oligoethylene glycol chains distributed along a polymer backbone.
These features eliminate PEG’s immunogenicity, while still providing prolonged circulation half-life and
compound stability. During a previous Phase I SBIR grant, Gateway demonstrated reliable synthesis of POEGMA
as well as conjugation to an FDA approved enzyme drug, uricase, currently marketed as a PEGylated
therapeutic, pegloticase (trade name: Krystexxa™), for the treatment of treatment-refractory chronic gout.
Pegloticase has been linked with high titers of anti-PEG antibodies, leading to severe allergic reactions as well
as reduced drug efficacy. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) showed that both PEG and POEGMA conjugation
increase the hydration radius of uricase with no change in the enzyme’s activity. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies
in mice also showed that both modifications result in dramatic improvements in circulating enzyme at 24, 48, and
72 hours over unmodified enzyme, with POEGMAylated enzyme showing increased serum levels over
PEGylated enzyme. Serum drawn from animals treated with PEG conjugated enzyme contained relatively high
titers of anti-PEG antibodies, including both IgG and IgM species. In contrast, after treatment with POEGMA-
conjugated enzyme, anti-POEGMA antibodies were undetectable. These data provide compelling evidence that
POEGMA can improve the drug properties of biotherapeutics without the fear of immune responses that reduce
efficacy or tolerability of the drug. Here, Gateway Bio proposes a Phase II program to accomplish the following
goals: 1) scaling up production of uricase (Gateway Bio) and POEGMA (with contractor CuraPath, Inc.); 2)
developing a high-volume conjugation method to generate POEGMA-uricase (Curapath); 3) a comparative study
between POEGMA-uricase and pegloticase in a murine model (Duke University subaward); and 4) initial toxicity
and biocompatibility studies to support a pre-IND meeting with the FDA to enable future clinical studies (with
contractor Charles River Labs). These efforts will support the continued development of POEGMA-uricase, as
initial technical and market validation for the company’s novel PEG alternative."

Solid tumors such as non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma afflict more than 250,000 Americans per year.
While immunotherapies such as checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) have improved cancer cure rates, they are only
effective in 20-40% of patients; hence there is a significant unmet need to improve solid tumor treatment
outcomes. Regulatory T (Treg) cells, classically defined as CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T cells, are a key target for cancer
immunotherapies since they inhibit anti-tumor T effector responses, promote tumor progression, and correlate
with poor treatment outcomes. Reducing tumor-associated Tregs would enhance innate anti-tumor immune
responses and would also be likely to improve the activity of CPI immunotherapies. Indeed, a Treg-depleting
immunotherapy, Ontak® which targets the CD25 molecule (abundant on Tregs) was on the market from 1999-
2011, but critical drawbacks, including 25% rate of vascular leak syndrome (VLS) and significant manufacturing
inconsistencies, led to its removal from the market. A “cleaner” version of Ontak with additional purification steps,
Remitoro, was approved for human use in Japan in March 2021, but still shows high levels of VLS. The need for
safe, effective anti-cancer agents targeting Treg cells remains. To address this need and advance the field
of Treg-depleting immunotherapy, Sonoval is developing a second-generation version of Ontak, called
SON-211. By modifying a key VLS-inducing domain of Ontak, Sonoval has virtually eliminated VLS in SON-
211, while full its cytotoxic potency against Tregs is retained. Sonoval also holds IP on a novel production method
that solves prior manufacturing problems. In Phase I equivalent results, SON-211 demonstrated potent anti-tumor
efficacy as a monotherapy, and showed significant anti-tumor synergy when used together with a CPI in murine
models of solid tumors (melanoma, colon carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma). Recently, our team member, Dr.
Drew Pardoll, showed that the most highly immunosuppressive Treg subset in human tumors (OX40hi GITRhi)
strongly expresses CD25 (the direct target of SON-211 and Ontak), while another Tregs subset (Tbet IFNG) has
paradoxical antitumor effects and very weakly expresses CD25. These data suggest that SON-211—by
targeting CD25—may selectively eliminate the “bad” OX40hi GITRhi Treg subset and preserve the
beneficial Tbet IFNG Treg subset. Building from this strong and highly encouraging preliminary data, Sonoval
will leverage these key new findings to characterize the ability of SON-211 to selectively “re-balance” Treg
subsets in tumors towards a potent inflammatory anti-tumor population. Specific Aims of this Direct to Phase
II project are to: 1) Determine the effect of SON-211 monotherapy vs. no therapy on the balance of Treg subsets
in the TME; 2) Compare the effect of dual therapy with SON-211 plus an Anti-PD1 CPI on the Treg subsets; 3)
Optimize expression of SON-211 for production/purification.; 4) Demonstrate an ability to manufacture SON-211
at scale; and 5) Perform pre-IND, dose-finding and toxicology studies of SON-211 in Sprague Dawley rats."

Fanconi anemia is an inherited illness caused by faulty Fanconi Pathway genes responsible for repairing DNA
damage. It is estimated to afflict 1 in every 100,000-160,000 and is characterized by bone marrow failure and
malignancies that cause disabling multi-organ disease and drastically diminishes patient life expectancy.
Although the molecular mechanisms of Fanconi anemia are complex, recent breakthrough studies indicate that
through DNA damage, toxic aldehydes such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde play a fundamental role in
disease pathogenesis. Most importantly, in addition to the Fanconi Pathway, dehydrogenase enzymes have
been shown to counteract aldehyde toxicity and protect hematopoietic development and function.
At present, no standard therapies are available and treatment is limited to symptomatic management and
alleviation of disease burden. These include the use of steroids, hematopoietic growth factors, and recurrent
blood transfusions. In more precarious circumstances, hematopoietic stem cell transplant can restore bone
marrow function and prolong survival. However, this complex procedure carries intrinsic mortality risk and is
limited by donor availability, compatibility, and transplant associated complications.
A few emerging strategies such as hematopoietic stimulants and gene therapy are being investigated as
potential treatments. While neither strategy addresses underlying sources of genotoxicity, the high number of
correctable mutations, graft conditioning requirements, and risk for leukemias present unique feasibility
challenges for gene therapy. Given the unclear outlook of emerging treatments and a limited therapeutic
pipeline, there is an urgent need to develop novel treatments to improve the well-being of Fanconi patients.
To meet this need, Kinetiq Therapeutics, a life science startup based in Texas, is developing an enzyme
replacement therapy (ERT) for Fanconi anemia, aimed at mitigating aldehyde toxicity. As part of our early
development efforts, our team has developed and characterized an aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme
(designated as KALH21) with high plasma stability and activity against both formaldehyde and acetaldehyde.
In this SBIR Phase I proposal, we will conduct proof of concept studies in healthy Sprague Dawley rats to
demonstrate the feasibility of KALH21 as an ERT. Following KALH21 intervention, we will quantify the systemic
clearance of aldehyde challenges (Aim 1) and establish drug disposition attributes (Aim 2) using mass
spectrometry and fluorometry. Once feasibility is established, we plan to conduct additional studies in a future
SBIR Phase II to evaluate KALH21 doses/regimens and their corresponding safety, efficacy, and disposition.
The successful development of our approach could potentially transform the standard of care for Fanconi
anemia and other conditions associated with aldehyde toxicity and metabolism (e.g. aldehyde dehydrogenase
deficiency syndrome, ischemic heart disease, and gastro-esophageal cancers)."
10999647,"Veterans with sensorimotor deficits due to spinal cord injuries and disorders (SCI/D) and other neurological
disorders often use power wheelchairs (PWC) for independent mobility. While PWC are critically important to
improving quality of life, lower limb injuries can occur when the foot is not positioned properly on the footplate
during PWC operation. In Veterans with SCI/D, sensory loss, paralysis, spasticity, contractures and obesity
create barriers to recognizing and correcting lower limb mispositioning. Veterans with SCI/D have sustained
fractures, abrasions, contusions, pressure injuries, and amputations after inadvertent lower extremity
displacements (ILED) from their PWC foot plates, at an estimated system cost of $970,011 for the first 10 such
Veterans admitted to the Cleveland VA SCI/D Center. Veterans Advocates with SCI/D report that ILEDs occur
during transfers, pressure relief, colliding with objects, muscle spasms, and driving over rough terrain. PWC
seating functions, like tilt and leg elevation, may misalign the feet on the footplate when returning to upright.
Yet, there is little documentation of the root cause of lower extremity injuries in the medical record, and ILED
incidence and prevalence are poorly described in the literature. No scientific reports of how the lower limbs
move during WC operation have been identified. This important knowledge can guide interventions to prevent
future foot displacements and subsequent injuries.
The VA-patented FootSafe system of force and proximity sensors with a wirelessly-connected smart device
was developed as an assistive technology to detect foot position relative to the PWC footplates and warn PWC
users when an ILED occurs, thus empowering them to either reposition their legs to safety or call for help if
needed. Other AT solutions also may be possible, however. Therefore, to create useful and accurate sensing
algorithms in future, it is first critical to understand the potential range of ILEDs and whether different PWC
user groups are more or less vulnerable to these events. As noted above, Persons with SCI/D can serve as an
exemplar of PWC users with sensorimotor losses creating risk of ILEDs and subsequent injuries.
This research project will use a 3 pronged approach to understanding lower limb movements and ILED
occurrence during PWC mobility.
Focus groups of Veterans with SCI/D, their caregivers, and seating specialists will be convened to advise on
the ILEDs they are primarily concerned about, how much limb displacement is acceptable and when they feel
corrections are required to prevent harm, to design terrains courses and determine PWC speeds needed to
increase likelihood of capturing ILEDs during testing, and to reach consensus on what constitutes a clinically
significant ILED and the needed sensitivity for detection by future algorithms.
FootSafe will be used in combination with motion capture and depth camera technologies to compare the
biomechanics and kinematics of lower limbs motion during PWC operation by Veterans with SCI/D and
neurologically intact PWC users in laboratory and community settings.
The FootSafe and 3-dimensional data sets acquired during the lab and community PWC mobility phases will
be analyzed using Machine Learning anomaly detection techniques to quantify limb displacements and further
understand how the limbs move over time. Video and wireframe diagrams for detected anomalies will be
brought back to the focus groups for their assessment of the clinical relevance as previously noted.
Understanding how ILED leading to these injuries occur, in what situations of PWC use and by which PWC
users is crucial to solving the problem of ILED-related injuries. Objective ILED documentation will not only
improve development of future assistive technology algorithms to detect and alert PWC users when ILEDs
occur, but will also support payor provision of preventative seating system modifications and promote
development of regulatory guidelines and unique solutions to prevent these unfortunate injuries."

 The overall goal of this proposal is to develop novel biomaterials for intracellular therapeutics delivery.
While messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are recognized as promising candidates for RNA therapeutics (such as anti-
inflammatory drugs) as well as research tools (such as delivering Cas9 mRNA for gene editing), unlike many
chemical molecules or antibody proteins, mRNAs need to be delivered into cell cytoplasm to be functional.
Various types of materials have been developed for successful intracellular delivery of small RNAs, but it is still
a major challenge to achieve effective delivery of mRNAs at both cellular and systemic levels. We aim to
overcome this by optimizing the biointerface properties of DNA-inspired Janus base biomaterials using
computational methods for molecular design, with experimental validation.
 There are two important obstacles for effective mRNA delivery: at the cellular level, the delivered RNA
cargos can be trapped and degraded inside cell endosomes after endocytosis (internalization by cells). For
example, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are commonly used delivery vehicles for mRNA in both academic and
industrial settings. However, the effectiveness of conventional LNPs is limited by their poor endosomal escape
ability which leads to the destruction of a significant portion of RNA cargos. At the systemic level (when
administrated intravenously), RNA delivery materials usually require surface modifications to reduce specific
and non-specific binding of serum proteins (or formation of protein coronas), increase blood circulation time,
and improve biodistribution. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a widely used surface modification polymer in clinics,
but its efficacy is significantly restricted because it can cause undesired immunogenicity in patients.
 To overcome these limitations, we will develop a novel delivery technology by manipulating the biointerface
properties of the DNA-inspired Janus base nanopieces (JBNps). JBNps are slimmer than conventional
spherical particles, allowing for enhanced infiltration into tissue matrices and barriers. As a result, JBNps have
a distinct advantage for delivery into “hard-to-penetrate” tissues such as articular cartilage and kidneys. Our
central hypothesis of this study is that sidechain and zwitterionic modifications can manipulate biointerface
properties of JBNps, accomplishing highly effective mRNA delivery into target tissues. Once our hypothesis is
confirmed, we can use JBNps to deliver mRNA for articular cartilage and kidney applications such as anti-
inflammatory mRNA therapeutics."

Dengue is an emerging global public health threat. Decades of extensive research undertaken primarily in
dengue-endemic regions has resulted in the prevailing consensus that secondary infections and antibody-
dependent enhancement (ADE) are pivotal in the pathogenesis of severe dengue disease. While previous
research showed severe outcomes in naïve populations, our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning
the pathogenesis of the severe disease during primary dengue infections, and how it diverges from secondary
infections, remains limited. Bridging this knowledge gap is vital, given that dengue is spreading to new areas
with substantial naïve population, compounded by lack of vaccines that can generate balanced immune
response or distinct clinical management protocols for primary versus secondary dengue. Hence, the specific
aims outlined below will provide comprehensive studies in India, where we find substantial burden of severe
disease by primary infections, to concurrently scrutinize the disease spectrum in primary and secondary dengue,
to elucidate pathogenesis. Aim 1, Determine the differences in innate immune responses during severe primary
and secondary dengue infection. Aim 2, Evaluate differences in the magnitude, function, and post-translational
modification of dengue-specific antibodies during severe primary and secondary dengue infection. Aim 3,
Determine how dengue specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses differ between severe primary and secondary
dengue infection. The proposed studies encompass in-depth analyses of innate, inflammatory, antibody, and T-
cell responses, alongside virological aspects, and their intricate interplay. Leveraging state-of-the-art tools and
technologies such as viral inclusive s\cRNA seq, Fc glycosylation, and human monoclonals, the research will be
primarily conducted in India utilizing samples from patient cohorts there. The joint ICGEB-Emory Vaccine Center
laboratory in New Delhi, that we developed over several years to enhance human immunology research capacity,
stands as an invaluable and unique resource for this endeavor."

Diabetes is a global health crisis. Depending on the type of statistical methodology used, the world-wide
incidence of the most common type of diabetes, adult-onset or Type II, is estimated to be in the range of 285
million. In both Type I and Type II diabetics, glycemic control is paramount as the inability to maintain glycemic
control results in increased risk of cardiovascular complications as well as several secondary complications
including neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy, that often lead to amputations, dialysis and blindness.
Hypoglycemia is a common adverse effect of insulin therapy and recent data shows that in the US alone almost
100k visits to the emergency department and more than 25K hospitalizations are due to insulin related
hypoglycemia. Not surprisingly, exposure to hypoglycemia can induce a form of habituation leading to impaired
awareness of hypoglycemia (IAH). IAH is a severe complication that often results in death due to patients being
unresponsive and unable to self-administer glucose or emergency glucagon. Currently, there is no available
approach to combating IAH. In our preliminary work we have designed and tested a series of novel dual agonist
drugs candidates we term molecular artificial pancreas systems (mAPS). Our studies have demonstrated the
mechanism of action and the ability of mAPS to prevent hypoglycemia at very high doses. In this Direct-to-
Phase II project we will pursue manufacturing, formulation, efficacy validation, and safety studies on 3 lead
candidates to identify a first in class dual agonist biologic suitable for safely treating Type I and Type II diabetics
experiencing IAH."
11007127,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pharmacological treatment to slow or stop the progression or prevent Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) represents an
unmet medical need. Clinical evidence shows that the core pathology of AD is the relentless destruction of
memory as the disease progresses. A large body of research literature has demonstrated that synaptic plasticity
is the pivotal underpinning mechanism of learning and memory. Notably, amyloid-β and tau have been shown
to produce deleterious effects by suppressing synaptic plasticity. Disruption of mechanisms of neuronal plasticity,
eventually resulting in a net loss of synapses, is implicated as an early pathological event in AD. Synaptic
dysfunction is likely a final common biological mechanism linking protein pathologies to disease symptoms.
Therefore, this evidence together motivated our company, ENCUE, LLC, to initiate a drug discovery program
that focuses on restoring synaptic health at the earliest stages of AD-induced dementia. The lead molecule in
our platform, JB2, induces structural and functional synaptic plasticity in the brain via activation of the insulin-like
growth factor 2 receptor (IGF2R). Our mechanisms of action studies have described a feed-forward/amplification
mechanism of JB2 for inducing synaptic plasticity. We discovered that JB2 showed specific binding to IGF2R-
containing spines in cortical neurons, IGF2R-containing complexes in synaptoneurosomes, and recombinant
IGF2R. JB2 can enhance intracellular calcium in HEK cells expressing IGF2R, at concentrations that are present
in the CSF following therapeutic dosing (1 mg/kg). In addition, JB2 facilitates synaptic strength in primary cultures
in a manner that is transcription and translation dependent, involves MEK/ERK signaling, and is dependent on
IGF2R (blocked by an IGF2R-specific antibody) but not IGF1R activation. We have also confirmed that JB2
induced long-term potentiation in a growth factor-like manner that is independent of the IGF1R and led to an
increase in N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole (AMPA) receptor
(AMPAR) activity as well as in IGF2R cell surface expression, suggesting a growth-factor-like autocrine
mechanism. Preliminary data also show that a single dose of JB2 reverses cognitive deficits in the 5XFAD mouse
model of Alzheimer’s. Building on these achievements, we proposed in this Phase I SBIR project to further
develop JB2 as a novel therapeutic to reverse or at least significantly delay the onset of cognitive dysfunction in
AD by returning the normal expression and function of AMPAR-dependent synaptic plasticity with our novel
platform of glutamatergic modulators. We will evaluate the pharmacokinetics profile, determine the maximum
tolerated dose of JB2 in mice, and examine the efficacy of JB2 in mouse AD models. The success of our Phase
I study will prepare the company for further pre-clinical evaluation of the dosing regimen (e.g., reduced dose
frequency) of JB2 in animal models of AD in Phase II. In addition, our Phase II project would consist of IND-
enabling toxicology studies and Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) studies of JB2."

Significance: The devasting outcomes for glioblastoma (GBM) patients remain despite the advances in
cancer therapy. Improved GBM therapy as a critical unmet need requires new intervention capabilities and the
likely integration of innovative GBM interventions as proposed with this research. The premise of this project is
that one of the challenges to improving GBM patient lives can be overcome by increased therapeutic coverage
of GBM tumors using an innovative convection enhanced delivery (CED) catheter. Innovations: The
proposed SBIR Direct to Phase II research offers the innovations of (1) improved GBM therapeutic agent
delivery obtained with the CED Porous Brain Infusion Catheter (PBIC) when combined with a more accurate
Molecular Flow Simulations (MFS) software – as the PBIC System and, (2) a novel approach to evaluate CED
drug delivery catheters with a randomized controlled trial. Preliminary Data: PBIC has demonstrated
preclinical in vivo increased volume of infused brain distribution. The MFS infusion planning software has
demonstrated robust correlation of actual and simulated human brain tumor infusions and has obtained FDA
510k marketing clearance. Comparative GBM tumor infusion simulations using the FDA cleared MFS software
indicate PBIC can increase therapeutic coverage of GBM tumors. Hypothesis: The PBIC will have equivalent
or improved safety profile and significantly greater percentage of enhancing tumor coverage than an end port
CED catheter. Overall Project Objective: Accelerate CED research with the clinical safety and infusion
distribution evaluation of the PBIC System in Aim 1 research. Specific Aim 1: First-In-Human study to
evaluate PBIC safety and recurrent GBM tumor infusion distribution efficacy. CreoSalus will manufacture PBIC
test devices and provide physician placement training. Duke investigators with Therataxis support will evaluate
the PBIC to treat recurrent WHO grade 3 or 4 malignant glioma (rGBM) patients, using an existing Duke
clinical trial of intratumoral therapeutic infusion via CED of D2C7-IT and 2141-V11 (NCT04547777, IND
151390). A total of 24 patients (12 patients per catheter group) will be randomized to either the PBIC or the
current Duke CED end port catheter. Safety analysis will be based on catheter related adverse events.
Infusion distribution in enhancing tumor will be evaluated with co-infused PET imaging tracers (124I-human
serum albumin (HSA)) same as used in prior Duke Brain Tumor Center and Therataxis CED distribution
studies. Aim 1 Milestone: Compared to the control end port catheter the PBIC will demonstrate (a)
equivalent or better safety and (b) significantly improved (p<.05) 124I-HSA distribution in enhancing tumor.
Research Impact: Improved drug distribution using a catheter specifically designed for CED to improve GBM
and other brain disease/injury patient outcomes."

Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type-1 (HIV-1) assembly mechanisms, namely the acquisition of the envelope
glycoprotein (Env) into the assembling viral lattice, remains inadequately understood. The continued innovation
of tools to interrogate these molecular and nanoscale assembly processes is beginning to disclose some of the
basic principles. This proposal aims to build upon these innovations and quantify the requirements for Env
assembly by interrogating viral and host factor determinants regulating intracellular trafficking, surface display,
virus incorporation, and cell-to-cell spread. To accomplish these aims, we will adapt current superresolution
and single-molecule tracking approaches developed by our laboratory to understand the three-dimensional
structural organization and spatiotemporal dynamics of Env throughout assembly stages and cell-to-cell
spread. Next, we will dissect the long Env cytoplasmic tail to understand which residues/regions drive Env
incorporation. Finally, we propose to identify the role of host trafficking factors in regulating the surface levels
of Env. Our preliminary data supports the feasibility of our approach by demonstrating our ability to extract
quantitative information regarding the nanoscale organization and single-molecule dynamics of Env in three-
dimensions. These collective approaches will shed new light on HIV-1 assembly and cell-to-cell virus transfer,
informing new models and approaches aimed at targeting these processes therapeutically."

Computational chemistry has revolutionized drug discovery, reducing by months or even years the amount of
time it takes to discover and refine a lead candidate. While computational chemistry has impacted discovery in
many ways, the greatest impact has been via virtual screening (to identify potential hits) and, more recently,
through free energy calculations. Free energy calculations such as free energy perturbation (FEP) are used in
hit-to-lead improvement. This discovery phase is typically carried out using costly bench chemistry, and tools
that can help reduce the number of potential modifications that can appreciably improve efficiency and reduce
cost. FEP allows one to evaluate the relative binding of a series of similar ligands to a receptor (protein or
nucleic acid) and focus only on those predicted to provide the greatest improvement.
While FEP has demonstrated multiple successes in terms of accelerating drug discovery, and while FEP is
now integrated as part of drug discovery at most pharmaceutical companies, it suffers from one fundamental
weakness, as commonly practiced: FEP is built upon a so-called classical molecular mechanical (MM) energy
function. This is a relatively simple function that crudely approximates the real-world energetics. The true
energetics are only properly represented using the equations of quantum mechanics (QM). But these
equations are so complex, and so computationally difficult to solve, that the entirety of the pharma-relevant
toolbox has traditionally integrated the inferior MM approach. FEP has been no different.
The result is that while FEP is quite accurate for certain systems where the MM approximations work well,
there are a large number of other systems—many of them quite important to drug discovery—for which MM,
and MM-based FEP are not reliably predictive. Since discovery projects at pharmaceutical companies are
chosen on the basis of biology and not on the basis of their suitability for computational chemistry, it is critically
important to identify an approach that can broaden the scope of usefulness for FEP to accommodate more of
the targets of interest to pharma. But replacing MM with QM in computational tools has, until our work, led to
methods incapable of pharma-relevant turnaround (a few days or less).
We have broken this barrier using a hybrid approach QM/MM approach, which provides significantly broader
and more accurate coverage of the entirety of the system space of interest to pharma while keeping
computational costs and turnaround low enough to be attractive to pharma. Our platform, QUELO, is unique
and demonstrably useful. In the first phase of this grant, we implemented, validated, and began marketing it.
In this grant phase, we propose algorithmic changes to QUELO to make it more computationally efficient and
modifications to allow it to be run on GPU (rather than CPU) computing platforms, which will further reduce
total cost and improve turnaround. This will accelerate the adoption of the program by pharma users."
11005107,"Emerging adulthood represents a uniquely sensitive period for studying social determinants of health in the
United States (US), as young people begin to establish their own paths towards higher education, careers, and
financial independence. College, specifically, is a time of changing socioeconomic position (SEP) that is not
often clearly captured in health research, despite strong ties between SEP and health. Over 40% of all young
adults aged 18-24 are enrolled as full-time college students in the US, and they increasingly represent the
diversity of the country in terms of SEP, race, and ethnicity, particularly colleges classified as Hispanic-Serving
Institutions (HSIs). (The 539 HSIs in the US serve over two-thirds of all Latinx, 40% of all Asian, and 22% of all
Black college students in the US.) Despite perceptions that emerging adult college students are at the peak of
health, over one-third of college students report being overweight or obese, and the incidence of
cardiovascular disease outcomes among young adults has been an increasing cause of concern. This risk is
exacerbated for low-SEP students, and students of color, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic began.
Therefore, emerging adult college students are a priority population to promote cardiovascular health, and
reduce health disparities, before the onset of chronic disease. The proposed longitudinal research addresses
these important scientific gaps by creating and studying a de novo, longitudinal cohort of 4,000 racially,
ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse young adult college students recruited as first-year students from two
HSIs in California and followed over three years, including if they leave college. The study will incorporate
anthropometric, institutional administrative, smartphone, behavioral, and self-reported data. The specific aims
are: (1) To determine the contribution of emerging adults’ economic stressors (e.g.,income, wealth, financial
stress, basic needs, residential environment, subjective social status) to cardiometabolic health outcomes
(e.g., weight-related measures, blood pressure) over time; (2) To determine the contribution of educational
protective factors (e.g., use of social supports, academic supports, basic needs supports) to cardiometabolic
health outcomes over time; (3) examine weight-related behaviors (i.e., sleep, physical activity, diet, disordered
eating, smoking) as mechanisms of associations between economic stress, educational protective factors, and
cardiometabolic health. This large, diverse sample will have sufficient statistical power to examine how
racialized and gendered identities may modify associations between economic and educational exposures and
cardiometabolic outcomes, which will help increase understanding of the complex interplay between different
social determinants of health and help inform potential interventions to reduce health disparities. Identifying risk
and protective factors that could affect weight and blood pressure among diverse emerging adult college
students can help inform novel interventions and support services to promote cardiometabolic health in a
significant portion of the young adult population."
10977933,"While there is strong evidence supporting the role of the anterior cingulate cortex, basolateral amygdala, and
the hippocampus (ACC, BLA, HIPP) as a key neural network regulating mood, and therefore central to the
pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD), much remains unknown, including which gene pathways
and which specific cell types play a primary causal role mediating alterations in this circuit, and what cell-type
connections, within and between these regions, are particularly altered in depressive states. The overall
objective of this application is to generate single-cell transcriptomic profiles to study molecular changes,
including those specific to genetic ancestry and sex, associated with MDD in the mood regulation circuit. While
disease burden is greater in African Americans, the impact of genetic ancestry remains unknown as most
genomic studies in MDD so far have been limited to subjects of European descent. In addition, previous
studies revealed that transcriptomic changes associated with MDD are sex-specific, and gene networks are
differentially dysregulated between sexes. The applicants’ recent single-cell brain study revealed cell-specific
contributions to transcriptomic changes associated with MDD. The proposed project is a large-scale,
systematic investigation in the ACC, BLA, and HIPP to interrogate the transcriptome at single-nucleus
resolution in an unprecedently large and representative sample of MDD. The specific aims are to: 1) Identify, at
the single-cell level transcriptomic changes associated with MDD in 800 subjects across three linked brain
regions: ACC, BLA, and HIPP; 1b) Study the impact of genetic ancestry and sex; 2) Define cell networks
associated with mood regulation using machine learning approaches; and 3) Identify cell-specific expression
Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTLs) colocalizing with genome-wide significant SNPs identified in MDD GWAS
analyses. A large cohort (N=800) of human post-mortem samples obtained from subjects with MDD will be
compared to psychiatrically-healthy controls. The sample (~20% African American and ~30% female) will allow
for studying the impact of genetic ancestry and sex. Droplet-based single-nucleus RNA sequencing will be
applied to generate transcriptomic profiles. Deep learning approaches will be used to identify and annotate the
cell types and gene networks associated MDD. The latest GWAS data in MDD will be leveraged to fine map
genetic loci with cellular and regional resolution. The proposed research is innovative because it is the first
large-scale investigation of the ACC-BLA-HIPP circuit in humans and will represent the largest single-cell
transcriptional resource of the human brain. It will identify gene and cellular networks associated with sex or
genetic ancestry, and will also generate a vast amount of transcriptomic data on neurotypical brains. This
research is significant because it will greatly advance our understanding of the cellular and molecular pathways
involved in mood regulation and MDD. Through a better understanding of the mechanisms of depressive
illness, we may be one step closer to developing novel treatment strategies and personalize interventions."
10977934,"The rural U.S. is sick, old, and in decline – or is it? This familiar narrative of “left behind” rural people and places

are large and growing, it is also true that some rural places are thriving. New approaches to researching rural
health and aging are needed, recognizing that rural America is not monolithic; it contains both resilient and
vulnerable places, and its challenges are multilevel and multidimensional. Building on the successes and lessons
of its last five years, the Interdisciplinary Network on Rural Population Health and Aging (INRPHA) will spark and
sustain new collaborations that will advance research on the factors affecting the health and wellbeing of rural
working-age and older adults within the context of prevailing demographic trends, slow-moving macro-level
stressors, and contemporary public health and environmental shocks. In so doing, the Network will inform new
approaches to improve wellbeing, health, and functioning in rural America. Our proposal is both significant and
novel because INRPHA’s activities will a) be national in scope and attend to differences in health and aging
across different rural regions, economies, population change patterns, and demographic groups; b) illuminate
not only rural-urban, but also within-rural variability to better understand variation in outcomes, including what
we can learn from thriving rural communities; c) elucidate mechanisms across the life course that are driving
observed rural-urban and within-rural health and aging outcomes, trends, and disparities; and, d) leverage ex-
isting NIH-funded data resources that can be used to advance rural population health and aging research. Lev-
eraging the institutional assets within the proposed Network’s five lead universities – U Minnesota, Penn State,
Syracuse U, Mississippi State, and U Colorado, Boulder – INRPHA’s aims are to (1) conduct and support re-
search that will enhance understanding of the multilevel and multidimensional causes of health, functioning, and
mortality outcomes, trends, and disparities among U.S. rural working-age and older adults, with a particular focus
on within-rural heterogeneity; (2) strategically grow the Network by expanding existing membership to include
scholars from relevant disciplines and who represent various topical and methodological perspectives; (3) pro-
vide development and training opportunities through pilot grants, structured mentoring, topical and data work-
shops, and regular network meetings, including efforts to promote members’ knowledge and use of existing NIH-
funded datasets conducive to conducting robust rural-urban and within-rural research; and, (4) advance mem-
bers’ dissemination of research findings through training and support of academic articles and policy briefs and
through public webinars to expand access to knowledge that will inform research, policies, and programs related

 This new Program Project Grant (PPG) utilizes recent advances in transcriptional biology to fundamentally
increase our knowledge of the long-lasting abnormalities in brain that underlie stimulant and opiate addiction.
Our work focuses on several specific cell types in key addiction-related brain regions: nucleus accumbens,
dorsal striatum, and prefrontal cortex. The PPG is composed of four Projects and three Cores all at Mount
Sinai. The PIs are leaders in their fields who have an established history of effective collaboration and use their
complementary expertise and approaches to chart a multidisciplinary course in the proposed research. Project
1 (Eric Nestler) focuses on novel transcription factors induced in brain reward regions by self-administered
stimulants and opiates. Project 2 (Paul Kenny) mines the PPG’s complex datasets to understand the role
played by circular RNAs in addiction; these are a newly discovered class of non-coding RNAs some of which,
within brain, are concentrated at synapses. Project 3 (Anne Schaefer) focuses on the influence of microglia in
controlling transcriptional responses to drugs of abuse within brain reward neurons and their behavioral
consequences. Project 4 (Yasmin Hurd) concentrates on the influence of enhancer regions, and their
transcriptional and chromatin mediators, in controlling molecular and behavioral adaptations to drugs of abuse.
All four projects validate findings from animals in human postmortem brain tissue, while discoveries in human
substance use disorders are fed back to animal models to explicate the underlying mechanisms involved. The
PPG is supported by three Cores, an Administrative Core (Eric Nestler) to oversee and coordinate PPG
operations; an Animal Models Core (Vanna Zachariou) to provide animal models of addiction and other
advanced tools (e.g., viral gene transfer, inducible mutant mice) to manipulate individual genes of interest in
specific cell types of the targeted brain regions and thereby provide causal evidence linking molecular-cellular
plasticity to addiction-related phenomena; and a Gene and Chromatin Analysis Core (Li Shen) to provide state-
of-the-art methods and bioinformatics to characterize genome-wide regulation of gene expression and
chromatin modifications in addiction. This pioneering investigation of transcriptional mechanisms of drug
addiction will help drive major advances in the field."
10977280,"Osteoporosis affects over 20 million Americans leading to 2 million fragility fractures and 300,000 hip
fractures every year. Among older adults with hip fracture, there is 5- to 8-fold increased risk of death
during the first 3 months post-fracture, and mortality 1-year post-fracture is approximately 25%. Current
osteoporosis therapies reduce vertebral fracture risk in high-risk patients but their ability to reduce the
risk of non-vertebral fractures and hip fractures, specifically, is modest. Osteoporosis therapies fall into
two classes: 1) antiresorptive agents that inhibit bone breakdown and 2) anabolic agents that stimulate
new bone formation. Anabolic osteoporosis drugs (which include parathyroid hormone analogs such as
teriparatide and the sclerostin inhibitor, romosozumab) are among the most efficacious medications
available but do have limitations. Teriparatide, for example, not only stimulates bone formation but bone
resorption as well, resulting in increasing porosity of cortical bone. Additionally, the anabolic effects of
teriparatide wane after 6-12 months of treatment. Conversely, romosozumab has a unique mechanism of
action in that it both stimulates new bone formation and inhibits bone resorption. While its inhibition of
bone resorption is sustained, however, its stimulation of bone formation is even more transient than
teriparatide’s, lasting only 1-3 months. Developing a therapeutic regimen that stimulates bone formation
in a sustained and durable fashion, while also limiting bone resorption would represent a major advance
in osteoporosis management and greatly improve patient outcomes. Animal studies have suggested that
combining parathyroid hormone analogs with sclerostin inhibition results in greater gains in bone mass
than with either drug alone, but this approach has not yet been systematically assessed in patients with
osteoporosis. Thus, the aim of this study is to comparatively assess the therapeutic potential of
combined anabolic therapy versus the current standard-of-care single-drug approach in postmenopausal
women at high risk of fragility fracture. Specifically, in this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that in
postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, combined treatment with teriparatide and romosozumab will
improve skeletal parameters more than a standard treatment course of 12 months of romosozumab
alone. The successful completion of this study and confirmation of our hypothesis has the potential to
fundamentally shift the way established osteoporosis is treated and introduce a new concept in
osteoporosis management."
10976919,"Abstract
Children increasingly confront complex sentences as they progress through the school years. Sentence
structures including passives and relative clauses are specifically mentioned in school curricular standards,
and children encounter these in the context of conversations, books, and movies. For the 7-13% of children
with a Developmental Language Disorder, the challenge posed by complex sentence comprehension and use
can contribute to poor academic achievement and negative social interactions. Yet the bulk of oral language
treatment focuses on vocabulary growth and grammatical morpheme errors in the preschool years, with scant
attention to later-developing language skills. This grant proposes to compare two entirely new treatments for
complex syntax. Two randomized clinical trials will test the effects of philosophically contrastive treatment
approaches that represent opposing points on an explicit-to-implicit continuum of language intervention. We
hypothesize that treatment methods in which children are taught to explicitly apply syntactic rules will produce
high in-treatment performance, but at the cost of the automatic, implicit knowledge required for rapid and
unconscious application to untrained linguistic contexts. Conversely, treatment intended to facilitate implicit
learning of syntactic forms will result in incremental in-treatment gains but will ultimately result in a more
generative knowledge and use of complex syntactic forms. We seek to replicate findings by conducting
separate clinical trials for the treatment of passive sentences and sentences with relative clauses. In addition to
supplying clinicians with much needed information concerning treatment effectiveness, the data will provide an
important theoretical test of causal components of our recently developed model of complex sentence
comprehension and use in children with Developmental Language Disorder.
Health relevance
The grant proposes to test new treatments for complex sentence knowledge and use, for which there is little in
the way of effective intervention. The grant will directly test the efficacy of two approaches to language
treatment (explicit training of language rules vs. implicit learning of syntactic structures) and will assess
different models of the causal relationships among cognitive factors and treatment outcomes."
10976923,"PROJECT SUMMARY
One in six people in the United States have infertility, which is treated most effectively with in vitro fertilization
(IVF). IVF is a powerful therapy that requires careful decision-making by patients to balance the risks of IVF
with the chances of having a healthy live birth. The most consequential decision during IVF is about the
number of embryos to transfer into the uterus. Transferring multiple embryos improves the chances of a birth,
but it also increases the likelihood of multiple births, which are risky for mothers and infants. Historically, health
insurance excluded coverage for IVF, but employers have been rapidly expanding IVF coverage as they
compete for employees. Employers are creating these new IVF benefits with little research evidence to guide
them. Poorly designed IVF benefits could cause more harm than good by inadvertently incentivizing multiple
embryo transfers and multiple births or by delaying care. Our preliminary research found that IVF benefit
designs range from generous (e.g., covering multiple IVF cycles) to meager (e.g., a lifetime cap of $5,000
when IVF costs $15,000 per cycle) and that cost is a top concern for patients. Much remains unknown about
how to design safe, high-quality IVF benefits. The investigators’ long-term goal is to generate compelling new
evidence that can improve the design of IVF benefits and therefore promote the health of parents and infants.
The central hypothesis is that IVF benefit design influences patients’ decisions during IVF and thus affects their
health outcomes. The rationale for this project emerges from the rapidly shifting landscape of IVF coverage
across the US, which is outpacing a scant research evidence base. The central hypothesis will be tested by
completing three Specific Aims: (1) Define the characteristics of employer-sponsored IVF insurance
coverage in the US; (2) Quantify which elements of insurance coverage for IVF most influence patient
decision-making during IVF; and (3) Evaluate the health outcomes and medical expenditures
associated with nine different IVF benefit designs. This study will be completed using a multi-method
approach that unites systematic, nationwide evaluations of the characteristics of IVF benefit designs, a
sophisticated survey of patient decision-making under different IVF benefit designs, and an analysis of real-
world patient outcomes and medical expenditures under nine employers’ different IVF benefit designs. With
these data, we will be able to measure real-world health outcomes and medical expenditures after IVF, predict
health outcomes for mothers and infants for a range of IVF benefit designs grounded in existing coverage
nationwide, and advise employers and policymakers on how to create IVF benefits that promote maternal and
infant health and avoid unintended negative outcomes. The research is innovative because it will define the
characteristics of IVF coverage in the US for the first time and quantify which elements of insurance coverage
for IVF most influence patient decision-making during IVF. The proposed research is significant because it
provides an evidence base to create safer IVF benefit designs in an era of coverage expansion."
10993972,"Pre-mRNA splicing is a fundamental process required for the expression of most metazoan genes. Defects in
splicing lead to human genetic disease and splicing mutations in several genes involved in growth control have
been implicated in multiple types of cancer. Insights into the basic mechanisms of pre-mRNA splicing and
splice site recognition are therefore fundamental to understanding regulated gene expression and human
disease. The control of alternative splicing is a highly combinatorial process, where many inputs dictate the
splicing outcome for each exon. A critical feature of these regulatory mechanisms is the specific interaction of
trans-acting splicing factors with cis-acting RNA elements. We use a highly integrated approach to investigate
the molecular mechanisms that regulate pre-mRNA splicing. This includes knockout and knock-in tissue
culture models, reconstitution assays using radioligands, transcriptomics, bioinformatics, kinetics, structure-
function and biochemical techniques. In the next five years, we aim to address several outstanding challenges
in the field, pursuing the following novel research directions. (1) Our demonstration that splicing regulatory
proteins display highly position-dependent activities that negatively or positively influence splice site choice
changed the way we think about the classical splicing activators (SR proteins) and the classical splicing
repressors (hnRNPs). It is now appreciated that the context-dependent activation or repression of U1 snRNP
serves as a gateway to allow the abundant U1 snRNP to fulfill its splicing function and its role in protecting the
pre-mRNA from premature degradation. However, how splicing regulators achieve activation or repression of
U1snRNP at the 5’ splice site is not understood. We aim to dissect the mechanisms of splicing repression by
embracing multi-system approaches and by understanding the role of U1 snRNP conformers in mediating
spliceosomal assembly. (2) Intron retention is an important alternative splicing pathway that has eluded
extensive study. Thus, its regulation is not well understood. The existence of inefficiently spliced introns within
coding exons (exitrons) further highlights the biological importance of understanding when introns are removed
efficiently and when they are not. Using synthetic biology approaches, we will decipher the rules of efficient
intron removal and investigate the impact of cis-acting elements in this process. The argument is that the
depth of the sequence variation tested in massively parallel reporter assays is far greater than the testing
landscape that the human genome offers. Here, we will use our expertise in experimental molecular biology
and bioinformatics. (3) It has become widely appreciated that gene expression events are highly integrated,
with evidence suggesting that most pre-mRNA processing occurs co-transcriptionally. Defects in any one of
these steps have been linked to disease. However, most published studies evaluate only steady-state levels
of gene expression or focus only on a single step. This ignores the dynamics of gene expression steps that
collectively contribute to the generation of proteins from mRNAs. Thus, it is unclear how the kinetics of RNA
processing and mRNA stability translate into an endpoint gene expression signature. We have established a
reliable method to metabolically label nascent RNA, which allows us to track transcripts from synthesis to
degradation. Work in this project will probe how steady-state mRNA levels are established, how the splicing
and translation regulator SRSF1 influences mRNA dynamics, and how these processes adjust as a cell
undergoes transformation. The goals of our research program are to obtain a better understanding of exon
recognition and alternative splicing. The new mechanistic insights will be leveraged to improve strategies to
therapeutically target this essential gene expression step."

 This diversity supplement will build on the SOL Air ancillary study to the Hispanic Community
Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL), and provide research and training experience to a
qualified early career trainee. The funded study, SOL Air, focuses on the relationship between
exposure to traffic-related air pollutants (PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen oxides, (NOx), and
ozone (O3)) and incident type 2 diabetes (T2D), using a fine-scale spatiotemporal model to predict
long-term exposure levels at participant’s residential addresses. Longitudinal health data is collected
by the HCHS/SOL. The diversity supplement will allow for additional investigation into how the
relationship between air pollution and T2D is modify by diet. Utilization of the HCHS/SOL cohort
allows us to investigate relationships between and within various Hispanic/Latino heritage group.
Longitudinal health data and 24-hour dietary recall questionnaires have been collected in all SOL
study participants.
 The prevalence of T2D is increasing, especially among younger adults and Latinos. Risk of
T2D has been linked to lifestyle factors such as an individual’s diet and activity levels. Long-term
exposure to ambient air pollution has also been linked to increased risk of incident T2D. Previous
research on ambient air pollution has mainly focused on particulate matter (PM2.5) and there is a high
level of heterogeneity between studies. Additionally, little prior research has focused specifically on
the US Hispanic/Latino population.
 We will examine the interaction between an individual’s diet, measured by the Alternative
Healthy Eating Index (AHEI-2010), and long-term ambient air pollution exposure to determine if those
following a certain diet have a different risk of developing T2D using Poisson regression models.
Further analysis will include the heritage and acculturation of participants as diet may be impacted by
participant’s heritage and how long they have lived in the US. Our findings will contribute to the
research on the interplay of diet, air pollution, heritage, and T2D risk in an underrepresented research
population."

Suicidal thoughts and behavior (STB) claim nearly 50,000 Americans and contribute >$90 billion in disease 
burden annually. Existing STB treatments cannot address the enormity of this problem because they are not 
scalable. Recent research shows that low aversion to suicide (i.e., perceiving it as less negative) is a STB risk 
factor and promising treatment target. However, no study has examined whether increasing suicide-aversion 
(making suicide seem worse) reduces STB. This K23 project follows an experimental therapeutic approach to 
answer this question. We will conduct user-centered design interviews with five adults (18+) and a one-arm open trial 
with 20 adults with recent and frequent STB residing within ~50 miles of Boston, MA to evaluate the safety and 
acceptability of Therapeutic Evaluative Condition for Suicide (TEC-S). TEC-S is a classical conditioning-based 
intervention delivered via smartphone targeting suicide-aversion. Based on these safety and acceptability data, we 
will optimize TEC-S (e.g., select specific stimuli) and randomize 60 adults with recent/frequent STB in the Boston area to 
receive 30 days of either active- or inactive Therapeutic Evaluative Condition for Suicide (TEC-S). We predict 
that active vs. inactive TEC-S will be associated with increased suicide-aversion (primary target) over the 30-
day treatment period, as assessed weekly via self-report and behavioral assay. Also, we predict that active vs. 
inactive TEC-S will be associated with reduced STB severity (e.g., suicidal desire) and incidence (e.g., suicide 
plans, attempts) during treatment, and that increases in suicide-aversion will be associated with these STB 
reductions (target validation). STB outcomes will be measured via ecological momentary assessment (EMA) 
three times per day during the 30-day treatment period, and once daily during a subsequent 30-day follow up. 
This project will produce the data required to develop an R-level optimization trial testing TEC-S among higherrisk suicidal participants leaving inpatient care. Study aims perfectly align with the candidate’s training goals: 
(1) conduct an RCT for STB delivered via smartphone; (2) design and implement EMA to measure STB; (3) 
ethics and human subjects protections in EMA with suicidal participants; (4) advanced statistics for multilevel, 
longitudinal data, including mediation and sensitivity analyses; and (5) career development. These training 
goals will be accomplished through the expert mentorship and guidance of the candidate’s primary mentor Dr. 
Sabine Wilhelm (RCT and digital mental health expert), co-mentor Dr. Evan Kleiman (STB EMA expert), ethics 
and safety advisor Dr. Kate Bentley (ethics and safety/risk management in STB expert), statistical advisor Dr. 
Walter Dempsey (longitudinal and mobile health statistical expert), and technical advisor Dr. Alex Millner (STB 
and TEC expert). If successful, this project could establish an evidence base for a highly scalable, costeffective, and mechanistically informed STB treatment that could prevent the tragic loss of life caused by STB. 
The proposed project and training plan provide unparalleled learning/growth opportunities, launching the 
candidate’s independent research career focused on developing and testing scalable STB treatments."
10985580,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
While consolidated sleep is crucial for healthy cognition and mood in older individuals, many suffer from sleep-
wake fragmentation, a risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease. One countermeasure of sleep-wake
fragmentation is exposure to bright light (""phototherapy""). Studies using morning phototherapy, which targets
circadian phase, to restore sleep-wake fragmentation have reported mixed results. However, both mathematical
models of the circadian pacemaker and data from our lab suggest that afternoon light exposure, targeting
circadian amplitude, will have greater effects on sleep-wake consolidation. Since phototherapy can be
administered without significant adverse effects, it is a promising tool to reverse sleep-wake fragmentation and
slow cognitive decline. Therefore, the overarching goal of the proposed studies is to slow cognitive deterioration
in older individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) by investigating the utility of afternoon phototherapy.
The Research Training Plan will leverage state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques on big datasets
(specific aims 1 and 3) and an intervention clinical trial (specific aim 2). In aim 1 (K99), the applicant, Dr. Lok,
will train with Dr. Kochenderfer as she applies state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to determine
underlying factors contributing to sleep-wake fragmentation and cognitive decline. During this time, Dr. Lok will
also learn to conduct neurocognitive testing in individuals with mild cognitive impairment. Dr. Lok will conduct a
clinical trial (R00), investigating the utility of afternoon phototherapy in a stepped care approach to reduce sleep-
wake fragmentation and improve cognition. Finally, Dr. Lok will use machine-learning techniques to develop a
personalized phototherapy model to create a prediction score calculator. These endeavors ensure that these
projects' outcomes benefit the scientific and medical communities. Dr. Lok has the requisite training in machine
learning and clinical trials to undertake the proposed projects. The career development plan is intricately
designed to empower Dr. Lok with enhanced machine-learning skills and to facilitate a deeper understanding of
gerontology and the social determinants of aging. Mentor Dr. Zeitzer is a leading expert in human translational
chronobiology. Co-mentors Drs. Kochenderfer (machine learning), Fairchild (neuropsychology), and advisors
Drs. Jo (statistician) and Yesavage (Alzheimer's disease) offer complementary expertise. Dr. Lok proposes to
pursue these development goals and begin the proposed research with the support of the Department of
Psychiatry and Behavioral Science at Stanford University, which provides an ideal environment of research
support and resources to attain her training and research goals. In summary, the solid mentoring team,
environment, and proposed training plan anticipate fully launching Dr. Lok's independent career. The proposed
study will increase knowledge about contributory factors to sleep-wake fragmentation and cognition, as well as
a scalable intervention with the potential to ameliorate cognitive decline and other concomitants of fragmented
sleep, prevent Alzheimer's disease onset, delay institutionalization, and improve quality of life in older individuals."
10985581,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Value-based purchasing (VBP) reforms in the United States (e.g. pay-for-performance) seek to improve care
efficiency by reducing wasteful health care practices, which may harm patients and account for ~30% of the $4.1
trillion spent annually on US healthcare. Surgical care, which comprises over 50% of Medicare spending, is a
logical target for these reforms given it’s episodic and cost-intensive nature. However, surgical episodes are
targeted by just one-third of VBP arrangements, none of which have achieved net cost savings. As such, there
is a critical need to identify novel models of surgical care that provide insights/solutions to the failings of existing
surgical VBP efforts. Symptomatic urinary stone disease—aka renal colic—is a common (1 in 10 US adults) and
costly ($10 billion annually) surgical condition characterized by high levels of variation in perioperative outcomes
and costs, making it a condition ideally suited to evaluate drivers of perioperative care variation.
Current surgical VBP arrangement shortcomings may in part be due to misguided policies that reward strategies
seeking to minimize post-operative care variation rather than streamlining the sequence of episode-specific
clinical events preceding surgery. For example, there is growing literature demonstrating an association between
improved pre-operative functional status and post-operative health outcomes. Similarly, addressing patients’
social needs ahead of surgery appears to improve 30-day post-operative outcomes. Consequently, developing
and deploying value-based interventions in the pre-operative period that target clinical and non-clinical risk
factors may be particularly effective at reducing variation in perioperative care, and by proxy surgical disparities.
This proposal will employ an explanatory sequential mixed-methods design using a combination of claims data
and patient/provider interviews to 1) identify social risk factors associated with variation in both pre- and post-
operative expenditures/outcomes related to an episode of renal colic (Aim 1), 2) assess patient/provider
perspectives on facilitators/barriers to timely and effective surgical care provided for an episode of renal colic
(Aim 2), and 3) design and pilot a clinical decision support tool that personalizes follow-up for patients discharged
from the emergency department with renal colic and who will subsequently undergo surgery (Aim 3).
Ultimately, these efforts will 1) inform how social risk impacts surgical outcomes, 2) align surgical VBP efforts
with the patient-provider experience, and 3) serve as the basis for a future R01-funded trial assessing the impact
of a risk-adjusted clinical decision support tool on perioperative outcomes/expenditures following a renal colic
diagnosis."
10985635,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases will have a global impact on health outcomes
for people in the coming decades. Without a cure or preventative treatment, it is likely that the economic costs
to the U.S. and other countries will be prohibitive, with estimates in the billions of dollars. Thus, understanding
the pathophysiology of the disease process will be integral for future therapeutic treatments. The presence of
senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, only
NFTs have been shown to correlate with the severity of the associated dementia. NFTs have been shown to
consist of aggregates of phosphorylated tau protein. Tau normally functions to stabilize microtubules in
neuronal processes, but in diseased brain cells tau becomes part of insoluble multi-protein NFT complexes as
well as soluble pathogenic oligomers. The progression of the disease follows a well described path initially
displaying NFT-associated neurodegeneration in a brain region called the entorhinal cortex followed by
neurodegeneration in a downstream brain region - the hippocampus. Importantly, these brain regions are
crucial for the formation of long-term memories and are likely responsible for the memory loss observed in AD
patients. This proposal will investigate the effect of trans-synaptic spread of pathogenic tau from entorhinal
cortical neurons to downstream neurons in the hippocampus. Our preliminary evidence demonstrates that not
all neurons in the hippocampus accumulate pathogenic tau and that specific subtypes of neurons in the
hippocampus are particularly vulnerable. The experimental design will involve adeno-associated viral vector
transfection, immunofluorescence to monitor tau trans-synaptic spread, and the use of cellular
electrophysiology to assess the impact that pathogenic tau spread has on vulnerable hippocampal neurons.
Importantly, we will also determine the effect of pathogenic tau on network properties of CA1 pyramidal
neurons when tau is expressed in select vulnerable neurons. By understanding the resultant changes
produced by pathogenic tau at the cellular and network level, it may be possible to develop therapies to
counteract these changes at early stages of AD."
11002531,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Adolescence is a particularly important period in social and cognitive development, characterized in part by rapid
increases in exploration, social interaction, and neural connectivity. Social isolation in adolescence has a clear,
profound impact on a wide range of behavioral and physiological endpoints extending into adulthood. The
overarching research goal of this proposal is to elucidate how adolescent social isolation in male and female
mice alters value-based decision making in adulthood, as well as the underlying corticostriatal circuitry driving
these complex goal-directed behaviors. This work is timely and vitally important as COVID-19 has subjected an
increasing number of adolescents to social isolation through school closures and stay-at-home orders.
A first aim of this proposal is to use operant tasks to systematically investigate how adolescent social isolation
impacts how mice later value reward benefits and integrate expected costs during decision making. Preliminary
data suggests that adolescent social isolation amplifies reward value, but specific aspects of decision-making
behavior will be disentangled with computational modeling of value-based choice. The second aim builds on this
behavioral work to test the hypothesis that adolescent social isolation disrupts corticostriatal circuitry and striatal
output during adult value-based decision-making. A distributed neural network is engaged during decision-
making, and the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) is a key node in this network. Prefrontal inputs to the DMS from
the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) are critically involved in action selection and
outcome valuation, respectively. All three of these nodes undergo maturation and refinement during
adolescence, and adolescent social isolation disrupts this development. However, how this impacts adult
corticostriatal function remains unknown. Using in vivo electrophysiology, local field potential (LFP) and single-
unit recordings will be used to test how adolescent social isolation affects synaptic strength and connectivity from
these cortical regions to the DMS during value-based decision-making behavior.
This work proposed in the Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide Dr. Elizabeth Holly with
training in computational modeling of decision-making behavior and in vivo electrophysiology, which will be an
important part of the foundation of her independent research career. By completion of this Award, the goal is for
Dr. Holly to transition to a tenure-track faculty position and apply for an R01. The mentorship team Dr. Holly has
assembled will ensure her successful training in these techniques, and prepare her to transition to her own
independent research laboratory."
11002554,"PROJECT SUMMARY: The relationship between psoriatic skin and joint disease remains enigmatic. A subset
of patients with psoriasis develop arthritis, early diagnosis of which is challenging. Additionally, therapies for
skin disease are less successful at treating arthritis. A20 (Tnfaip3) is a broadly-expressed protein that restricts
multiple inflammatory signaling pathways and is genetically associated with both psoriasis and psoriatic
arthritis in humans. However, the molecular and tissue-specific mechanisms by which A20 restricts psoriatic
disease are unknown. Our preliminary data shows that A20's capacity for binding linear ubiquitin is critical for
preventing distal digit psoriatic skin and joint disease in mice, with pathology requiring TNF, IL17A, and T-cells.
Early disease surrounded the epidermis; therefore, we generated mice allowing inducible deletion of A20 only
in keratinocytes in adulthood (A20iEKO mice). Remarkably, these mice also develop similar psoriatic skin and
joint disease that requires TNF, IL17A, and T-cells. I aim to determine the immune mechanisms by which A20
dysregulation in keratinocytes orchestrates skin and joint disease. Aim 1 centers around understanding the
cytokine requirements for coordinating the pathogenic immune infiltrate. In Aim 2 I will dissect the role of T-
cells by determining which subsets or antigen-specific cells are critical for pathogenic cytokine secretion as
well as their anatomical sites of action. Aim 3 focuses on the cell-intrinsic role of A20 in keratinocytes, where I
plan to understand the mechanisms by which A20 restricts inflammatory pathways in vivo, during keratinocyte
differentiation, and downstream TNFR and IL17R. Together, these studies will reveal how keratinocytes can
orchestrate an inflammatory process that results in psoriatic skin and joint disease. This is relevant to NIAMS
because these studies may help explain how human psoriasis is connected to psoriatic arthritis and may reveal
novel therapeutic targets or biomarkers for early or potential arthritic disease.
 My long-term goal is to establish an independent research program studying how inflammation remains
localized within epithelial tissues such as the skin. The studies described above will provide an outstanding
starting point as they aim to understand how skin dysregulation can cause joint inflammation. My research
background is primarily in cellular signaling and protein biochemistry. My career development aims are to build
my intellectual and scientific foundation in cellular immunology and develop professional relationships with
rheumatology-focused researchers. I also plan on developing key research skills in epithelial biology as well as
transcriptomic and statistical analysis. These development goals will be pursued with didactic courses along
with participation in seminar series, workshops, and conferences. Together with mentorship from Dr. Averil Ma,
a leading molecular immunologist, and guidance from a multidisciplinary scientific advisory committee of
immunologists, epithelial biologists, and genomics experts, these aims will position me for an independent
research career as a physician-scientist."

Neuromuscular Dynamics, LLC has developed the Leg Dexerity System, a patented portable, wireless device
for short-latency sensorimotor circuit neuromuscular training using unstable dynamic foot-ground interactions
that can be utilized as nonsurgical management of knee OA to reduce pain and improve function. The Leg
Dexerity System was designed to be used in a seated position that allows users to compress a platform atop a
slender spring, which becomes unstable as it begins to buckle at low forces. Sustaining pressure while
maintaining stability over the spring challenges and trains the user's proprioceptive and neuromuscular control,
focusing specifically on the low-level circuitry essential for proper knee mechanics. The tablet computer
connected to the device, linked to a HIPAA-compliant cloud platform, provides participants with feedback
during use and uploads participant activity data to the server for analysis and reporting that is accessible to
both participants and clinicians to inform continued care.
This Direct-to-Phase II project primarily aims to clinically validate and enable a go-to-market strategy for the
Leg Dexterity System as a home-based exercise device for the nonsurgical management of knee OA. This
project will utilize a longitudinal blinded dose-matched trial comparing 8 weeks of leg dexterity training
(Treatment using a slender, unstable spring that engages short-latency sensorimotor control, 42 participants)
vs. stable leg presses (Placebo using wider, stable spring, 42 participants) at the Steadman Philippon
Research Institute. The project envisions the system being used in about 1,600 clinics, representing around
3% of physical therapy clinics in the United States, within five years. This adoption is projected to improve care
for OA patients and generate clinic income through billable Remote Therapeutic Monitoring (RTM) by
integrating a robust, remote, industry-standard clinical UI/UX that clinicians can use to improve their remote
care and grow their RTM revenue."

Michelle S. Keller, PhD, MPH is a health services researcher with Assistant Professor appointments at Cedars-
Sinai Health System (CSHS) and UCLA. Dr. Keller’s research focuses on reducing inappropriate medication use
in older adults, particularly in populations with high levels of medication use, such as older adults with Alzheimer’s
Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). Reducing inappropriate medication use in older adults has been
shown to reduce mortality, but evidence is limited on whether interventions that reduce inappropriate medications
reduce hospitalizations and emergency department visits. More than half of older adults in the U.S. receive their
care from health systems and provider groups which contract with Medicare Advantage plans or are part of
Accountable Care Organizations, organizations which are financially accountable for Medicare beneficiaries’
health costs. These organizations proactively manage chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and
high cholesterol to prevent unnecessary avoidable hospitalizations. This proposal aims to create a similar
approach to managing medication use through the development and validation of a risk prediction model and
registry that identifies older adults with a large number of potentially inappropriate medications and other
conditions that place older adults at risk for hospitalization, including age, cognitive decline, frailty, and risk of
falls. This proposal will use this registry and risk model as part of a feasibility and acceptability study to identify,
refer, and enroll older adults with ADRD in a pharmacist-led medication review intervention aimed at reducing
inappropriate medications. Dr. Keller’s career development and training plan includes coursework in embedded,
pragmatic clinical trials and geriatrics. Dr. Keller will accomplish the proposed research and training aims with
the support of a strong multi-disciplinary mentoring team from UCLA and CSHS: Catherine Sarkisian (geriatrics
and deprescribing), Zaldy Tan (ADRD) Teryl Nuckols (health systems science), Joshua Pevnick (medication
management), and Nicole Brandt (pharmacy and deprescribing). These efforts will be supported by the
outstanding research environment and infrastructure of CSHS and UCLA. Given the strong mentoring,
institutional, and infrastructure supports in place, the proposed K award program is ideally designed to provide
the PI with the experience needed to launch her career as an independent investigator and future leader in
deprescribing research."
11005449,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1) is an autosomal recessive Inborn Error of Metabolism (IEM), characterized
by the inability to metabolize tyrosine and caused by the deficiency in fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH)
enzyme. The liver is central to IEMs, including HT1. Acute HT1 causes severe liver dysfunction and death, if left
untreated. Chronic HT1 leads to liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Early and life-long pharma-
cological treatment with nitisinone (NTBC) can minimize liver damage. However, due to residual cellular toxicity
that accumulates over years, HT1 patients on nitisinone remain at risk of cirrhosis, HCC, and liver failure and
experience progressive neurocognitive decline. Liver transplants remain the only curative therapy for HT1.
Liver-directed gene therapy, in which the defective gene is replaced with a functional isoform, has the potential
to replace risky liver transplants and costly life-long pharmacological treatment. HydroGene has developed a
non-viral gene delivery to the liver for affordable and safe gene therapy that can meet all the requirements for
successful HT1 therapy. Unlike the Lentiviral method, which suffers from low efficacy of liver delivery, safety
issues related to systemic immunotoxicity, and expensive manufacturing that limits its scalability, HydroGene
has developed a routine method of efficient hydrodynamic delivery of non-viral DNA specifically to hepatocytes
via the biliary system. Because the method of gene delivery is based on a routine endoscopic clinical procedure
that can be performed in under 30 min and has minimal complications, it is ideal for translation to clinics. In
addition, the method can deliver non-immunogenic naked DNA that is cheap to manufacture and can be easily
tailored to different rare diseases. Therefore, the HydroGene liver gene therapy is suitable to be translated to
clinics for cost-effective life-long correction of HT1 and other rare monogenetic liver diseases.
In this Fast-Track application, the objective is to demonstrate the clinically relevant efficacy of using hydrody-
namic gene delivery for the treatment of HT1. One of the key features of HT1, and many other rare genetic liver
disorders, is continuous liver damage and injury, causing excessive cell death. As a result, corrected hepato-
cytes have a survival advantage and will repopulate the damaged liver, but only if the corrective gene is trans-
ferred into both daughter cells. Thus, to cure HT1, it is essential for the FAH gene to be integrated into the host
genome. To this end, the focus of Phase 1 is to optimize the vector system for safe genome integration and
efficient cure in a HT1 mouse model. All the data obtained in Phase 1 is directly translatable to studies in a large
animal proposed in Phase 2. The focus of Phase 2 is to determine the exact vector composition and regimen for
interruption/tapering treatment with nitisinone in the most clinically relevant large animal HT1 model. The final
product of this proposal is a clear path toward clinical translation of hydrodynamic delivery of an integrating
vector system to treat HT1 patients and beyond, to many other inborn errors of metabolism and liver diseases."

CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) play a key role protective role in HIV-1 infection, but cannot fully
suppress the virus because they require antigen for maintenance. HIV-1-specific CTLs mediate the
suppression of HIV-1 for the “asymptomatic” phase of chronic infection. The CTL response partially controls
infection, but once the antigen is cleared to very low levels, they decay to low frequency resting central
memory cells. Since CTLs require antigen to maintain effector function, they cannot fully suppress even in
most “elite controllers,” who exhibit pathogenic low level infection. To suppress HIV-1 fully, CTLs need to be
maintained independently of HIV-1 replication.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) drives CTL persistence through frequent low grade reactivations. Frequent
spontaneous non-pathogenic reactivations of CMV drive persistent maintenance of CMV-specific active
effector CTLs.
We hypothesize that creating CTLs recognizing both CMV and HIV-1 can yield superior control of HIV-1
infection. Such CTLs would be maintained by natural CMV reactivations to be primed as active effector cells
against HIV-1. To achieve this goal, we have developed a prototype bi-specific chimeric antigen receptor
(CAR) that recognizes both CMV and HIV-1, coupling maintenance to CMV and de-coupling maintenance from
HIV-1. This project will expand that effort; specifically we aim:
 1. To optimize a panel of CMV and HIV-1 bi-specific CARs;
 2. To evaluate the function of these CARs in the BLT humanized mouse model."
11006459,"The goal of this project is to develop bioprocess-compatible, second generation nanoCLAMP affinity resins to
several high-value plasma-based therapeutics and characterize their performance metrics to provide tools for
improving process efficiency. The plasma-derived therapy market ($19B) is expected to double by 2033, with
new target proteins being rapidly developed. Due to the high cost of the raw material for these therapeutics
there is a critical need for efficient recovery of the proteins in plasma. A bioprocess-compatible affinity
chromatography platform capable of high percentage and specificity recovery of plasma proteins would enable
lower cost production of existing therapeutics and drive development of new ones. The incorporation of affinity
chromatography into downstream processing of non-tagged proteins is hampered by a lack of bioprocess-
compatible affinity ligands with adequate affinity, specificity, and durability. Most available protein-based
affinity ligands are not caustic-stable, limiting their use in repeated cycles of cleaning in place. This work seeks
to apply a novel bioprocess-compatible antibody mimetic platform, called the nanoCLAMP, to affinity
chromatography processing of human plasma to streamline downstream purification of plasma-based
therapeutics. The specific aims of this proposal are to:
 1. Identify panels of nanoCLAMPs to 5 industrially relevant plasma-based therapeutics
 2. Select leads with desired performance metrics.
 3. Purify targets from plasma using lead resins and optimize linker lengths and resin composition to
 maximize % recovery and purity. Scale up production of lead affinity chromatography resins and
 determine performance metrics of final products (10 ml scale) for purification of targets from
plasma.
The successful completion of this project will yield a versatile platform for the development of affinity
chromatography resins utilizing the innovative nanoCLAMP ligand, allowing for the high-purity isolation of
protein components from plasma. The customizable nature of nanoCLAMP ligands will enable tailoring the
resins for specific blood components, addressing current challenges in the purification of complex biological
samples. The outcomes of this research have the potential to revolutionize protein purification processes in
biopharmaceutical and clinical applications, enhancing the efficiency and reliability of downstream processing."

While the number of lung transplantations performed worldwide is steadily growing every year, the number of
viable donor lungs remains frustratingly small compared to the increasing demand. Indeed, the vast majority of
potential donor lungs continue to be labeled as `marginal'—i.e., untransplantable—as a result of failing to meet
current clinical organ procurement criteria: harvested from a donor 55 years old or younger, clear on x-ray, and
adequately oxygenated under ventilation. However, because the measurements are based on an incomplete
assessment of donor lung tissue status, they may also be unnecessarily restrictive.
Developed as a technique for prolonging organ preservation prior to transplant while simultaneously offering a
platform for evaluating and potentially reconditioning `marginal' donor lungs, ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) was
first introduced in 2001 and has been employed clinically in hundreds of lung transplants since. To take full
advantage of EVLP as a tool for expanding the pool of transplantable donor lungs, however, the development of
non-invasive biomarkers capable of generating a more comprehensive assessment of donor lung health is
needed in order to optimize the utilization of `marginal' donor organs.
We propose to address this need by developing an imaging-compatible pre-clinical EVLP system capable of
obtaining structural, functional and metabolic biomarkers in the donor lung, that can be used to optimize EVLP
parameters in a rat lung transplant model. We will then utilize these biomarkers to non-invasively assess donor
lungs with three commonly occurring defects in donor lungs that have been shown to lead to poor post-transplant
outcomes: atelectasis, ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and reperfusion injury resulting from extended cold
ischemia. Injury-specific treatment strategies will be applied during EVLP in order to recondition lungs prior to
transplant, and surgical outcomes will be correlated post-transplant with imaging biomarkers obtained during
EVLP.
Finally, we will assess the full suite of developed markers to determine which justify translation, and will modify
a clinical EVLP system to demonstrate that the same biomarkers can be obtained in human lungs rejected for
transplant. Moving forward, the precise, quantitative, structural, functional, and metabolic information on donor
lungs that this platform provides can be used to non-invasively assess the protective effects of established
interventions aimed at rendering marginal lungs suitable for transplant—potentially unlocking EVLP's ability to
meaningfully increase the donor pool."

The Rocky Mountain Virology Association (RMVA) will hold its 24th annual meeting September 27th-29th, 2024.
The meeting brings together regional and national investigators in virology and prion biology for a 3-day retreat-
style conference with extensive interaction and collaboration. The original meeting was organized by
investigators in Colorado and Wyoming interested in free and open exchange of scientific data and ideas in
virology in a venue that promotes collaboration among students, post-docs and faculty. Specifically, our annual
meeting at the CSU Mountain Campus encourages young scientists to present their research and receive
feedback from established scientists. The goals are promotion of scientific interactions and training. A major
benefit of participation has been the novel collaborations that arise between scientists in different disciplines.
Topics discussed include medical virology (vaccines, epidemiology, viral zoonoses), arthropod-borne diseases
(viruses, RNA metabolism, viral vectors and vector biology), host defenses (viral immunology and pathogenesis),
prion biology, cancer biology and systems biology. Special sessions on vaccine development, pandemic viruses,
virus discovery and the global impact of viral diseases have been common features. The 2021 meeting had a
retrospective on the COVID-19 pandemic with discussions on successful approaches and establishment of
systems for future challenges. The next meeting will feature discussions on Immune mechanisms of arthropod
vectors, pathogen genomics, arenaviruses, filoviruses, coronaviruses, noroviruses, arboviruses (flaviviruses and
alphaviruses), lentiviruses, prion diseases, paleovirology, neurobiology, host-pathogen interactions, virus
latency, epigenetics and host response. The meeting offers excellent collaborative opportunities. Attendees
include scientists from CSU, University of Colorado, University of Wyoming, University of Northern Colorado, the
Centers for Disease Control (Fort Collins) and the Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service, regional biotech companies, and universities in Iowa, Idaho, Nebraska, Kansas, Montana, New Mexico
and Utah. The RMVA was incorporated in 2010 as an educational charity (501(c)(3)). Our volunteer board of
directors is charged with encouraging student and junior faculty involvement by minimizing costs as we
encourage women and minorities to participate in all stages of program presentation and development. Our
attendance is limited to a maximum of 125 individuals, and the growth of the meeting to capacity illustrates the
desire of regional scientists to participate. Funds for this proposal are requested to provide minority grants and
childcare, reduced registration fees for graduate students, post-doctoral fellows and early-stage investigators,
and for travel and housing for seven invited speakers. Registration fees, charitable contributions, and
sponsorships cover the base costs for the meeting. The RMVA has been a source of communication and
collaboration in the Rocky Mountain region, with outreach across the nation, for twenty-three years. NIAID
support has expanded meeting interest to national and international levels."

Archae and Bacteria face a nearly constant onslaught of diverse stressors both expected (e.g., nutrient
fluctuations, temperature changes, phage predation, etc) and unknown (e.g., novel antibiotics, unanticipated
changes in environment, etc). How they detect and respond to such stressors largely determines their survival
in a world of fierce competition. Understanding how microbes respond to stress will elucidate the fundamental
principles governing key cellular processes that are conserved from bacteria to humans where they prevent
genetic disease and cancer. Determining the response of microbes to stress impacts areas such as
biotechnology, ecology, environmental biology, viral tolerance, manufacturing, and the relationships that
microbes establish with their eukaryotic hosts.
The latest advances in this field will be the subject of the 2024 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on
Microbial Stress Response to be held July 14-19, 2024 at Mount Holyoke College. bringing together a
demographically diverse group of 200 international scientists seeking to understand how microbes sense and
respond to unanticipated and ever-changing environments. Attendees are encouraged to present posters of
their most exciting research. Emphasis will be placed on new approaches to understanding interactions
between microbes and the environment, particularly modern imaging, genetic, metagenomic, and
computational strategies for the analysis of bacterial physiology and community structures under conditions of
stress and competition. A key feature of this conference is its welcoming and highly interactive environment
that brings together investigators at all levels. Invited speakers include established and highly recognized
scientists as well as junior investigators with diverse backgrounds. More than 50% of invited speakers are
women and 40% of oral presentations will be selected from the submitted abstracts with an emphasis on those
by new investigators, postdoctoral scientists, and graduate students. Daily poster sessions will be a major
element of the meeting, enabling the dynamic exchange of new results and ongoing work, while promoting
interactions between conference participants at every level. Postdoctoral and graduate student participation is
further encouraged by the accompanying Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), organized by students, trainees,
and early stage investigators for their peers. We anticipate the 2024 Microbial Stress Response GRC will
continue the success of its predecessors with cutting edge discoveries unveiled for the first time to a
multidisciplinary and critical audience."

Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths of women in the United States and worldwide.
Immunotherapy is a promising approach, but has not proven successful yet in metastatic breast cancer,
particularly in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is the most aggressive subtype among all breast cancer
subtypes, with little treatment options available. First-line treatment with pembrolizumab–chemotherapy results in
better overall survival than chemotherapy alone among patients with advanced TNBC. Sacituzumab Govitecan is
offered as an option for the second line of treatment. Despite these significant progresses, most patients eventually
collapse and die without further treatment option. Thus, TNBC remains an unmet medical need for urgent
development of novel therapeutics. The rationale for this application is that clinical responses to immune
checkpoint therapy rely on the presence of tumor-infiltrating and antigen-specific T cells. Thus, development of
tumor-specific TCR-T cell immunotherapy is key to the success of immunotherapy in breast cancer. Immunova
Therapeutics is a startup company with the mission to further develop TCR-T cell immunotherapy for the treatment
of solid cancers, including TNBC. Due to the nature of tumor heterogeneity, antigen loss or negative tumor variants
represents a key mechanism to develop resistance to immunotherapy. This IMT-422 product is an HLA-DR13-
restricted KK-LC-1-specific TCR-engineered CD4+ T cells, and has been demonstrated to completely inhibit or
even eliminate TNBC in a mouse model. Our finding is also supported by recent studies showing that CD4+ T cells
could eliminate antigen-positive and -negative tumor cells. To further improve the therapeutic potential, we
engineered TCR with three key technologies to increase the pools of stem-like memory T cells and resistance to
T cell exhaustion and immune suppression. We named the final IMT-422 product as CD4 TCR-STEM T cells,
which could completely reject breast cancer growth in a mouse model. Based on these solid data, we propose to
generate GMP grade Master Cell Bank (MCB) and viral particles of TCR-STEM required for Chemistry,
Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) (Aim 1); and determine the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and
pharmacological toxicity of the IMT-422 (CD4 TCR-STEM T cells) product (Aim 2). Upon completion of the
proposed studies, we are well positioned to initiate and file an investigator-initiated new drug (IND) application for
a future phase I clinical trial, thus accelerating the development of new breast cancer immunotherapy."

The field of maternal-infant HIV research has been especially attuned to the challenges of attaining authentic
informed consent in low-literacy populations affected by a condition that still carries social stigma. Our teams at
Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC), New York and Stellenbosch University, South Africa have
been undertaking research in maternal and child populations affected by HIV in South Africa over the past
several years. For three recent studies, we partnered with a local company to develop visual informed consent
forms (ICF) with the goal of strengthening the consent process. Yet we require additional data before entirely
replacing the standard written consent with the visual consent approach in future trials. Here we propose a
pragmatic evaluation of the current visual informed consent along with formative research. This data will
collectively inform a visual consent approach to be tested in a subsequent R01-level clinical trial. For this R21
study, we propose to partner with a social science expert in empirical ethics from RTI International to evaluate
one of the currently used visual ICFs in an NICHD-funded clinical trial (R01HD105492). The clinical trial is
testing the efficacy of a synbiotic supplement to reduce infant morbidity and improve growth in 210
breastfeeding mother-infant dyads, including mothers living with and without HIV. Dyads are recruited post-
delivery and consented before the infant is 4 weeks of age. The trial is underway in the Breede Valley, an
agricultural area in the Western Cape Province, South Africa. For Aim 1, we propose to prospectively evaluate
the visual ICF among 40 women living with HIV considering enrollment into our trial. We will randomize 40 new
potential participants to receive either the visual ICF at the initial informed consent visit (n=20) or to receive the
text only ICF (n=20). Data will be collected via mixed methods to explore knowledge and decision conflict or
regret immediately after the consent process and 8 weeks later. For Aim 2, a concurrent evaluation will be
conducted among 20 women living with HIV determined to be ineligible for the trial. Aim 2 will include concept
and usability testing of the visual ICF using a semi-structured, qualitative, think-aloud approach. Based on the
study data, the multidisciplinary study team will develop recommendations for the use of participant-centered,
low-literacy approaches to replace standard text-only ICFs in maternal-child health and HIV research
conducted with vulnerable populations. The outcome of this project will lead to our next study, where we will
develop and test a standalone visual consent form that is designed to replace a text only consent form in a
randomized trial. The long-term goal is to inform efforts to improve meaningful consent into studies and
contribute to greater inclusivity in clinical research."
11005378,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal dysbiosis in women of reproductive age and is associated
with a number of serious health complications. Gardnerella vaginalis is believed to play a critical role in the
etiology of BV, functioning as a pioneering organism that can displace beneficial lactobacilli and initiate BV
biofilm development. As G. vaginalis proliferates, the pH of the vaginal environment increases, leading to
further decreases in lactobacilli and enabling the growth of additional BV-associated bacteria within these
biofilms. Standard antibiotic treatment for BV suffers from high relapse rates, the development of antibiotic
resistant bacteria, and collateral damage to the healthy lactobacilli in the vaginal microbiome. Given these
drawbacks, novel antimicrobial agents that can provide alternatives to antibiotics and can selectively
target BV-associated bacteria without damaging beneficial bacteria are urgently needed.
Endolysins are phage-encoded enzymes that can degrade bacterial cell walls. Exogenously added endolysins
can quickly lyse their target bacteria and because they bind very specific epitopes in target cell walls, they can
have lytic specificity down to a single species or even sub-species. Given these properties, endolysins hold
enormous potential as high-specificity microbiome modulators. Recently, endolysins targeting G. vaginalis
have been identified and demonstrated to kill G. vaginalis. However, the endolysins that have been
characterized thus far are not well suited for commercial development. Endolysins that are more active, more
thermostable, and function at lower pH are needed to be broadly useful for treating BV.
At Topaz Biosciences, we have developed a proprietary metagenomic platform for the discovery and
optimization of endolysins. We have previously leveraged this platform to develop endolysins against
Staphylococcus aureus that are more active, more thermostable, and have a broader pH range than
benchmark enzymes. In this Phase I proposal, we will leverage this platform to expand the diversity of
endolysins known to have activity against G. vaginalis and then exploit this diversity to develop
chimeric enzymes with improved properties. To accomplish this, we will take advantage of the modularity of
endolysins to build a library of endolysin “parts” – enzymatic domains (EADs) and cell wall binding domains
(CBDs) that we will systemically characterize for anti-Gardnerella activity, thermostability, pH tolerance, biofilm
reduction, and genus specificity. These parts will be sourced both from recently identified endolysins from
Gardnerella prophages as well from diverse endolysins/domains from proprietary and public metagenomic
databases that we predict to have anti-Gardnerella activity. Finally, we will leverage sequence-function insights
gained from our “parts” development to design chimeric endolysins composed of EADs and CBDs with the
most promising properties to generate enzymes with improved activity, thermostability, and pH range."

Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are detected in virtually all people in the U.S. and the evidence of
health effects at increasingly low levels of PFAS, is growing. Despite being used in manufacturing since the
1940s, there was little awareness or research on the health effects of PFAS until the last 15 years. A 2016
National Toxicology Program (NTP) systematic review concluded that PFOA and PFOS is a presumed immune
hazard to humans. In particular, decreased antibody response has been identified as a critical endpoint for
international, national, and state toxicity values and drinking water regulations. Despite the regulatory
importance, research on the health consequences resulting from reduced immune function is not definitive.
Common childhood infections and immune hypersensitivity outcomes such as allergies, are useful measures
for evaluating altered immune function in humans, and notably, no U.S. based cohort study has evaluated
these outcomes. Combing pediatric birth cohorts with available prenatal PFAS serum concentrations from
across the Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes cohort, we will evaluate associations with
childhood infections (bronchiolitis, croup, pneumonia and bronchitis, ear infections) and allergies (allergy
symptoms, and atopic dermatitis) at infancy and early childhood. PFAS will be evaluated individually in
adjusted linear and logistic regression models and as mixtures using Bayesian Kernal Regression Models
(BKMR). Potential effect modification by breastfeeding, child sex, child BMI, and sociodemographic factors will
be evaluated to understand differential impacts due to cumulative exposures. Dietary and sociodemographic
determinants of PFAS will be assessed with correlation analysis and multivariable linear regression across the
ECHO-wide study and for each cohort to provide guidance on further reduction of PFAS exposure in U.S.
pregnant women. Positive and null findings from well conducted studies alike, will be important for
understanding safe levels of exposure and guiding future regulations."

Lung cancer remains the most lethal cancer among both women and men in the United States. There is a clear
need for developing new and more effective therapeutics for the treatment of lung cancer, especially the most
predominant subtype non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). As posttranscriptional gene regulators, the
genome-derived microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) govern many critical cancer cellular processes such as
proliferation, invasion, and stemness. Therefore, restoration of tumor suppressive miRNAs (e.g., miR-124-3p
(miR-124)) lost or downregulated in NSCLC cells represents a novel therapeutic approach. However, current
research relies primarily on the use of chemo-engineered miRNA mimics (ChemoRNAs) synthesized in vitro and
comprised of extensive and diverse types of artificial modifications at various locations, which are different from
natural RNA molecules produced and tolerated in vivo that do not contain any modifications or just a few
necessary posttranscriptional modifications. Our past and ongoing efforts have led to a patented platform
technology to achieve a robust, high-yield, and large-scale in vivo fermentation production and use of true
biologic or bioengineered RNA agents (BioRNAs). We have demonstrated that BioRNAs, consisting of only
several natural modifications, are precisely processed to target miRNAs (or siRNAs) to selectively regulate target
gene expression in human NSCLC cells and subsequently, inhibit NSCLC cell proliferation and invasiveness as
well as tumor progression and metastasis. Among the NSCLC-relevant biologic RNAs, we have identified a few
lead miRNAs (e.g., miR-124 and miR-22-3p (miR-22)) consistently exhibiting potent antiproliferative activities
against multiple NSCLC cell lines. Our preliminary studies have also showed that BioRNA/miR-124 is more
efficacious than commercial ChemoRNA/miR-124 to regulate target gene expression and NSCLC cell viability,
and miR-124 may control NSCLC immunity via modulating specific immune regulator and checkpoint protein
levels. Further, we have found that miR-22 controls NSCLC metabolism through the regulation of key nutrient
metabolic enzymes and transporters. Moreover, humanized BioRNA/miR-124 and miR-22 lipopolyplex
monotherapy effectively reduced tumor progression in animal models without causing any hepatic or renal
toxicity or severe immunogenic effects. Given such exciting preliminary findings, we hypothesize that novel
bioengineered RNA molecules can be utilized to modulate NSCLC metabolism and immunity to improve
therapeutic outcomes of current medications via pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions. To test
the hypothesis, we propose to define the biosimilarities between model Bio- and Chemo-RNA molecules by
side-by-side comparing their efficacy and specificity in the regulation of target gene expression and inhibition of
NSCLC cell growth (Aim 1), delineate the molecular pharmacological actions of lead BioRNAs in the control of
NSCLC cell metabolism and immune checkpoint (Aim 2), and establish the effectiveness and safety of BioRNAs
to improve the therapeutic outcomes of co-administered drugs in vivo (Aim 3). The proposed research will
establish BioRNAs as one-of-a-kind RNA molecules for research and open new directions for the development of
novel biologic RNA therapeutics for the treatment of NSCLC."

This proposal is an R24 research network application. The Social Science Genetic Association Consortium
(SSGAC) is a research network that provides a platform for large-scale, interdisciplinary collaborations on
genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of behavioral, social, and other aging-related phenotypes. Summary
statistics produced by the SSGAC are widely used in medical, epidemiological, and social-science research for
studying biosocial science, health disparities, and aging-related topics, and for integrated analyses with omics
including genome-wide methylation, gene expression, and brain imaging.
The overarching goal of this proposal is to create and disseminate resources for the genomics and omics of
behavioral and social phenotypes. The Specific Aims are:
 • Conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of a wide range of behavioral, social, and other
 aging-related phenotypes in unprecedentedly large samples, using the most up-to-date methods to
 maximize power, and broadly disseminate the resulting summary statistics and PGIs. In addition to
 (standard) population-based GWAS (i.e., in samples of unrelated individuals) in samples with genetic
 ancestries similar to those of the 1000 Genomes subsample EUR, we will also disseminate results from
 family-based GWAS (i.e., controlling for parental genotypes, either measured or imputed from other
 genotypes relatives) and diverse-ancestry GWAS. Diverse-ancestry GWAS may be particularly useful for
 studying, and ultimately mitigating, health disparities across genetic ancestries.
 • Produce and disseminate materials for non-technical audiences that address appropriate interpretation
 of genomics research on behavioral and social phenotypes and its social and ethical implications.
 Building on the SSGAC’s practice of accompanying every major paper with Frequently Asked Questions
 (FAQs), we will convene a Community Advisory Panel to get public input on important questions that
 may be missed by FAQs to date. We will write general FAQs about the field as a whole, which can then
 be referenced by subsequent, briefer, paper-specific FAQs. We will create paper-specific FAQs that
 address the new and major issues raised by family-based and diverse-ancestry GWAS and PGIs and
 their potential uses and misuses.
 • Develop new methods for analysis of summary statistics and PGIs, prepare user-friendly software
 manuals, and make the software tools publicly available on a GitHub repository featuring a Q&A forum.
 We will also host and advertise monthly online methods/software seminars, taught by the developers of
 new methods. We will emphasize new methods that integrate the analysis of genomic summary
 statistics with other omics data."

Thoracic aortopathy – aneurysm, dissection, and rupture – is increasingly responsible for morbidity and mortality
in younger (having genetically predisposed lesions) and older (having sporadic lesions) individuals alike, female
and male. Despite many seminal discoveries since 1991, when the genetic basis of Marfan syndrome (MFS)
was uncovered, advances in clinical care have largely remained limited to improvements in surgical methods
and devices as well as better identification of patients who warrant monitoring of aortic diameter until surgery;
patients otherwise continue to be treated with anti-hypertensive medications mainly to reduce hemodynamic
loads on the vulnerable aorta. There is clearly a need for increased understanding. Although such aortopathy
can arise from a predisposing monogenic mutation, we will test the compelling hypothesis that secondary
changes in cell signaling and gene expression represent either potentially protective compensations or further
pathological consequences, and macrophages play key roles in this regard. We submit that, in the absence of
gene editing to correct the predisposing mutation, there is a need to preserve / promote compensatory gene
products while preventing pathological ones. Noting further that hypertension is a key risk factor for aortic
disease, we hypothesize that detailed associations of the transcriptional profile and biomechanical phenotype
will better elucidate mechanisms by which hypertension exacerbates thoracic aortopathy.
Toward this end, we will use consistent methods to quantify the transcriptional profile that drives the bio-
mechanical phenotype of the aorta in 3 mouse models (2 novel) of Marfan syndrome. In this way, we will quantify,
for the first time, specific roles of hypertension as well as two sub-populations of macrophages (resident vs.
recruited) to determine regulatory pathways and cell-cell interactions that superimpose on those associated with
the underlying predisposing mutation and drive changes in aortic structure and function. We submit that
consistent “transcript-to-tissue” level data across these mouse models, as a function of sex as a biological
variable, will provide the large data sets needed to develop 2 new classes of multifidelity, multiscale, data-
informed computational models that will enable unprecedented integrative understanding of molecular, cellular,
and biomechanical mechanisms that drive thoracic aortopathy while providing unique insight into possible new
targets for treatment. This project is significant given the increasing morbidity and mortality associated with
thoracic aortopathy; it is innovative in its consistent quantification of the transcriptionally driven biomechanical
phenotype across diverse mouse models, its use of two new double-mutant mouse models, and its use of novel
advanced (multi-cell, multiscale) computational models to integrate findings across predisposing mutation, cell-
type, and risk factors to delineate protective versus pathologic factors that dictate disease progression."

Medicare beneficiaries with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) typically require significant
amounts of formal and informal healthcare. These treatments often lack coordination, conflict with patient and
family preferences, and are costly to patients, families, and public payers. While most research has focused
those in Traditional Medicare (TM), nearly half of Medicare beneficiaries are now enrolled in Medicare
Advantage (MA), the managed care alternative to TM. MA plans receive flat, per-enrollee payments to
incentivize efficient care and have flexibility in benefit design that enables them to offer expanded home care,
concurrent palliative and curative care, and other services that may benefit complex ADRD patients.
However, MA plans increasingly rely on predictive software and non-clinical care managers to make decisions
about patient care, limiting plans' spending on patient care including use of these tools to deny many services
that would be covered in TM. MA coverage denials may result in large bills for patients who must pay for
necessary care out of pocket and/or greater reliance on help from family and friends, demands that can harm
financial, physical, and mental well-being of informal caregivers. Additional spending or informal care use has
the potential to further exacerbate socioeconomic disparities; out-of-pocket ADRD spending in the last 5 years
of life represented 84% of wealth in Black households and 47% for those with less than a high school
education. Thus, treatment decisions in MA can create intergenerational spillovers to the health and finances
of patients' family members. In this grant, we study healthcare utilization and intergenerational transfers among
patients who eventually develop ADRD using administrative and survey data. We ask 4 related questions to
understand the impact of Medicare coverage choice on ADRD patients and their families: 1- Do ADRD patients
experience more potentially preventable hospitalizations, burdensome transfers, and discharges without home
care in MA vs. TM?; 2- Does MA mitigate or contribute to disparities in access to post-discharge care by race,
ethnicity, or income among ADRD patients?; 3- Do intergenerational time and money transfers differ in ADRD
families when the patient has MA vs. TM?; 4- Do posthumous family transfers differ in ADRD families with MA
vs. TM? Wealth and housing are key social determinants of health. We may see widening disparities in
subsequent generations If ADRD patients disproportionately need to rely on transfers from children in MA or
TM or leave fewer resources to their children and grandchildren. With growing enrollment in MA, it is critical to
understand the impacts on ADRD patients and families. Research on the value of MA has not yet considered
whether MA shifts the burden of care to families, potentially imposing large and unappreciated social costs.
Our team will consider these questions while working with the U54 coordinating center to meet research
milestones, share code and preliminary results, and translate findings to policymakers, patients, and other
stakeholders."

 Syphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum spp pallidum (T. pallidum), cases are rising at an alarming rate
with devastating consequences for pregnant individuals and neonates. Syphilis in pregnancy carries a 21%
increased risk for stillbirth, 6% increased risk for preterm delivery, and 9% increased risk for neonatal death.
Some neonates with congenital syphilis manifest symptoms of disseminated infection before 2 years of age
(early congenital syphilis) which carries a mortality rate of up to 38%. However, most neonates (60-90%) are
asymptomatic at birth, and may develop symptoms of congenital syphilis later in life with risks for permanent
damage to nervous, bone, eye, and musculoskeletal systems. There is currently no molecular diagnostic test for
congenital syphilis in routine clinical use. Instead, indirect diagnosis of possible or probable infection relies
heavily on neonatal serologic titer relative to maternal titer and maternal treatment history. Due to risks
associated with a missed diagnosis of congenital syphilis and the lack of accurate diagnostics, treatment
decisions are frequently subjective. There is a critical need for accurate, sensitive, and direct detection of syphilis
infection to better inform diagnosis and treatment for congenital syphilis.
 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based molecular tests have become routine for the detection of
numerous infectious diseases due to the sensitivity and specificity of the technique. Sensitivity of PCR differs
according to gene target, specimen type, and sampling technique. Despite attempts to develop PCR targeting
regions of conserved genes like PolA and Tp47, no FDA approved syphilis PCR test exists. There is a gap in
our understanding of the optimal sampling strategy for PCR as an adjunct to current algorithms for diagnosis of
congenital syphilis and risk stratification, particularly in asymptomatic neonates. Therefore, we hypothesize that
molecular PCR performance can be optimized by determining the best diagnostic specimen(s) for
congenital syphilis in the context of maternal stage, treatment history and neonatal clinical evaluation.
 We have assembled a team to optimally address this hypothesis. Dr. Emily Adhikari is a maternal-fetal
medicine specialist and Medical Director of Perinatal Infectious Diseases at Parkland Hospital where she
supervises diagnosis and treatment of syphilis in pregnancy. In collaboration with neonatologist Dr. Shamaila
Gill, and pediatric infectious disease specialist Dr. Amanda Evans, comprehensive neonatal diagnostic
evaluation and clinical staging will be performed. Dr. Jeff SoRelle is trained in molecular genetic pathology and
the requirements to clinically validate a test. He has developed several molecular tests including COVID-19
variants, which led him to collaborative efforts of the impact of Delta and Omicron variant infections in pregnancy
with Dr. Adhikari resulting in publications in JAMA and Am J Obstet Gynecol. We propose the following aims:
AIM 1: Determine whether PCR detects T. pallidum DNA in neonates exposed to maternal syphilis.
AIM 2: Determine the best sample type and source for T. pallidum PCR."

 In 2020, following a thorough assessment of the scientific evidence on acupuncture, the Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued the decision to initiate coverage of acupuncture for management
of chronic low back pain (cLBP) in Medicare beneficiaries. cLBP is a highly prevalent and difficult to manage
condition, particularly in the highly vulnerable Medicare beneficiary population, and many patients with cLBP
continue to receive prescriptions for analgesic medication despite evidence-based clinical guidelines that
prioritize use of non-pharmacologic therapies, including acupuncture. Therefore, the CMS decision to cover
acupuncture promises to improve the quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries with cLBP by providing an
alternative to high-risk pharmacological interventions. The principal objective of this project is to assess the
impact of the new CMS decision upon patient outcomes. Thus, the first aim of the project will be to compare
safety, efficiency of care, and costs of care for Medicare beneficiaries receiving acupuncture as compared to
pharmacotherapy for management of cLBP. Because the CMS decision came with restrictions on coverage
that could impact equitable access to care, important project objectives will also include measuring the
availability of acupuncture providers under Medicare, describing patterns and trends in utilization of
acupuncture by Medicare beneficiaries, and determining facilitators and barriers to the use of acupuncture for
both providers and patients. The approach to the first aim will be to analyze nationally representative Medicare
claims data, using cohort, crossover cohort and interrupted time series designs. Availability and utilization will
be evaluated through cross-sectional analysis of Medicare claims data combined with collected data on the
supply of acupuncture providers. The approach to the assessment of facilitators and barriers for acupuncture
will be to conduct focus groups and analyze the results using an immersion-crystallization approach. This study
is expected to find that use of acupuncture by Medicare beneficiaries is associated with an equivalent or
superior impact on the safety, efficiency of care, and costs of care for cLBP as compared to pharmacotherapy,
and to demonstrate that the decision to allow coverage of acupuncture has had a positive impact on healthcare
outcomes for Medicare patients with cLBP. The research is also expected to reveal provider and patient
attitudes and beliefs about use of acupuncture under Medicare, and may reveal unwarranted variation in the
availability and utilization of acupuncture under Medicare. The project is expected to make significant
contributions to improvements in the care of patients with cLBP by strengthening the evidence in favor of the
utilization of acupuncture by Medicare beneficiaries and hastening its systematic adoption in a way that
ensures equitable patient access to high value spine care."

 Heart failure is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Hypertension is one of the most
important risk factors of heart failure. Despite paramount interests and urgent clinical needs, our understanding
of the mechanisms of heart failure development remains limited. To accommodate the elevated demand of
cardiac contractility under high blood pressure, the heart mounts an acute reaction through cardiomyocyte
hypertrophic growth. This once adaptive response may decompensate and progress into heart failure. The long-
term goal of this project is to identify novel mechanisms of the pathological transition from adaptive cardiac
hypertrophy to heart failure and explore therapeutic interventions.
 With an unbiased phosphoproteomic analysis, Rps6kb1 was identified as one of the most prominent
kinases in cardiomyocyte hypertrophic growth. Rps6kb1 is a classical downstream target of mTOR, however, its
role in hypertensive heart disease remains incompletely understood. Moreover, Rps6kb1, with its complex
activation mechanism, may integrate signals from multiple upstream pathways, above and beyond the mTOR
signaling. Preliminary studies showed that Rps6kb1 deletion in the heart suppresses adaptive cardiac
hypertrophic growth and consequently, cardiomyopathy and heart failure are accelerated under pressure
overload. Based on these findings, a central hypothesis is formulated that Rps6kb1 is an essential player in
adaptive hypertrophic growth by integrating signals from multiple upstream pathways. Additional preliminary data
showed that Rps6kb1 is directly phosphorylated by ERK, independent of the mTOR signaling. A novel threonine
site of phosphorylation by ERK was later identified by mass spectrometry. More importantly, ERK-mediated
phosphorylation of Rps6kb1 is required for full Rps6kb1 activation. Further pilot tests demonstrated that Rps6kb1
is subjected to another post-translational modification, K63 polyubiquitination. Lysine 85 was identified as the
critical site for this modification through multiple mutagenesis assays, and Lys85Ala mutation strongly diminished
both ubiquitination and activation of Rps6kb1. In this grant application, the role of ERK-mediated phosphorylation
of Rps6kb1 will be further characterized, and its implications in adaptive hypertrophic growth and heart failure
will be illustrated using both gain- and loss-of-function mouse models. In addition, the relevance and significance
of Lys85 ubiquitination in hypertensive heart disease will be delineated by identification of the responsible E3
ligase and evaluation of the novel Lys85Ala knock-in mouse model. Moreover, the interplay between this novel
phosphorylation and this new ubiquitination in cardiac hypertrophy will be interrogated. Primary cardiomyocyte
culture will be employed to complement in vivo animal models at the mechanistic level. Elucidation of the role of
Rps6kb1 as an integrative player in pathological cardiac remodeling will advance our understanding of
hypertensive heart disease and heart failure and pave a way for novel, more effective therapeutic design."

Background: In recent years, while combustible cigarette smoking has decreased, use and co-use of electronic
nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and cannabis smoking has increased among adults of reproductive age. This
suggests that some children may be experiencing higher levels of environmental exposure to combustible
cigarettes (ETS), electronic nicotine delivery systems vapor (ENV), and cannabis smoke (ECS). However,
exposure profiles across child development remain poorly characterized, which hinders efforts to quantify
whether exposures are associated with developmental risks among children, particularly poorer mental health.
Aims: This project will use the Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) dataset, which is a
large, national sample of longitudinal, observational data, to accomplish the following aims: 1) Characterize ETS,
ENV, and ECS emission exposure subgroups at each of the following timepoints: the prenatal period, infancy,
early childhood, middle childhood, and adolescence, 1a) Identify sociodemographic and primary caregiver
mental health characteristics associated with exposure group membership across each developmental period,
1b) Specify stability and changes in ETS, ENV, and ECS exposure group transitions across the prenatal period,
infancy, early childhood, middle childhood, and adolescence to delineate trajectories, and 2) Examine how
exposure during the prenatal period predicts trajectories of internalizing and externalizing symptoms across early
childhood, middle childhood, and adolescence.
Significance: This project will elucidate how shifting adult smoking and vaping patterns translate into emission
exposures among children. It addresses limitations of previous evidence by accounting for co-occurring smoke
and vapor longitudinally while accounting for possible confounds such as maternal psychological stress.
Identifying high-risk subgroups and associated mental health consequences can inform policy prevention and
public understanding of this emergent hazard.
Training: If funded, this dissertation grant will contribute to the applicant’s goal of an academic research career
and will advance an innovative research program investigating the impact of parent, or family member, substance
use on child development through a multisystemic lens, such as the consequences associated with
environmental health risks like environmental smoke and vapor exposure."
10977961,"Systemic hypertension is a leading worldwide cause of morbidity and mortality. Salt-sensitivity is seen in
over half of affected individuals with systemic hypertension as well in significant numbers of normotensive
individuals at risk for subsequent development of hypertension. The etiology of “essential” hypertension is
multifactorial and has been described as a “mosaic”, but numerous studies indicate an important role for both
the adaptive and the innate immune systems in mediation of salt-sensitivity by affecting both kidney and
vasculature in hypertension development and/or exacerbation. The studies proposed in this application will
investigate novel interactions of the myeloid cyclooxygenase (COX)/prostaglandin system with the adaptive
immune system and mechanisms by which this interaction can mediate regulation of kidney salt handling and
hemodynamic responses to dietary salt.
 Myeloid cells of the innate immune system, especially macrophages and dendritic cells, are known to be a
rich source of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins, and specifically PGE2, can act as immune modulators and affect
both macrophage/dendritic cell and T cell function. Cyclooxygenase is the rate limiting step in the synthesis of
prostaglandins from arachidonic acid, and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) is the predominant inducible isoform in
myeloid cells. We previously found that PGE2 is the predominant prostaglandin produced by COX-2 in kidney
myeloid cells (macrophages and dendritic cells), and myeloid COX-2 deficiency leads to a proinflammatory
(“M1”) phenotype while COX-2-mediated activation of the PGE2 receptor, PTGER2/EP4, promotes a non-
inflammatory, alternatively activated (“M2”) phenotype. Experimental and epidemiologic evidence link inhibition
or abnormalities in the cyclooxygenase/prostaglandin system to the pathogenesis or exacerbation of
hypertension. Our previous studies demonstrated that COX-2-derived prostaglandins from myeloid cells of the
innate immune system are important mediators of kidney salt and water balance. Wild type mice transplanted
with COX-2-/- bone marrow exacerbated increases in high salt-induced blood pressure. However, our previous
studies did not elucidate the mechanisms mediating these blood pressure alterations. We now find that mice
with selective myeloid deletion of COX-2 have increased hypertension and T cell kidney infiltration in response
to a high salt diet, but myeloid COX-2-/- mice crossed with mice with the Rag-1 deletion, which lack mature
lymphocytes, fail to increase blood pressure. These results indicate a potential role for myeloid COX-2 activity
to decrease T cell activation in response to a high salt diet. In the present studies, Aim I will investigate
alterations in T cell phenotype in response to myeloid deletion of COX-2 alterations in T cell-mediated increases
in kidney sodium reabsorption and/or directly activates kidney sodium transporters. Aim II will determine the
role of myeloid COX-2 activity to activate the PD-L1/PD-1 system to decrease T cell activation and the role of
myeloid COX-2 deletion to increase myeloid cell isolevuloglandin production and thereby activate T cells."

Our ultimate goal is to develop a practical, theranostic platform for managing PC. Prostate cancer (PC) is the
second most common cancer and the fifth most frequent cause of cancer death among men. Despite a gradually
improving trend in outcomes, the current death rate remains unacceptably high, with metastases in 20% of
afflicted men. The American Cancer Society estimates approximately 268,490 new cases and 34,500 deaths
from PC in the United States in 2022. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression has been
associated with aggressive PC, and is present in over 90% of metastatic disease. Those features have led to
employing PSMA for PC detection with radionuclide imaging, and for therapies including antibody-drug
conjugates, targeted radiotherapeutics and immunotherapeutic approaches. Nearly 450 trials involving PSMA in
PC are registered on clinicaltrials.gov. Nevertheless, all of the current therapies show some degree of toxicity
and are not curative. We are well-positioned to develop novel therapies through application of our PSMA-
targeted theranostic agents. We have recently synthesized PSMA-targeted poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM)
dendrimers that may be used for PC-specific concurrent delivery of imaging and therapy. PAMAM dendrimers
serve as versatile delivery vehicles that can be tailored to different sizes and compositions. Here we propose
development of multimodal theranostic agents enabling: (I) highly specific PSMA targeting; (II) application of
quantitative positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) ultimately for selecting patients for
therapy; (III) incorporation of a potent antimitotic agent; and, (IV) incorporation of optimized chemical exchange
saturation transfer (CEST) moieties to enable non-invasive monitoring of PC drug delivery by the clinically
ubiquitous imaging modality, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). As we have shown, CEST is sufficiently
sensitive to enable targeted imaging. When high-frequency salicylate moieties are used there, is a frequency-
specific contrast not encumbered by background signal, allowing determination of targeting efficiency. Direct
imaging of drug biodistribution provides information needed to understand and improve efficacy. The proposed
PSMA-targeted theranostic agents will be synthesized via consecutive conjugation of PAMAM dendrimer with
deferoxamine (DFO, for radiolabeling with 89Zr, enabling PET/CT and evaluation of pharmacokinetics), lysine-
urea-glutamate moieties (KEU, for PSMA targeting), and numerous 4-(3-carboxypropanamido)-2-
hydroxybenzoic acid molecules [salicylic acid (SA) derivatives for CEST contrast]. For therapeutic studies,
proposed theranostic agents will be additionally equipped with maytansine 1 (DM1) and monomethyl auristatin
e (MMAE, both routinely used of formulation of antibody-drug conjugates) via either encapsulation or
conjugation. We will use mice bearing clinically relevant human PC metastatic xenografts for pharmacokinetic
studies. Studies will be carried out using state-of-the-art multimodal PET/CT, MRI and optical imaging."

In the US, there are 7.3 million older adult immigrants (inclusive of refugees), and by 2060 the US’s older adult
immigrant population is anticipated to increase to 22 million. Compared to other older adults in the general
population, older refugees have a disproportionate burden of challenges related to past pre-resettlement
traumas, language barriers, family stress, social isolation, employment, and access to health care. These
challenges and stressors, in turn, are associated with poor mental health. Unfortunately, older refugees receive
limited attention from providers, and there is a dearth of evidence-based interventions designed to meet the
needs of this vulnerable population. Our goal is to use a community-based participatory research approach
(CBPR) to conduct an exploratory sequential mixed methods longitudinal study of mental health of older adult
ethnic-Nepali Bhutanese with a refugee life experience resettled in the US. First, we aim to use qualitative
methods to explore social support as a protective factor for mental health among older Bhutanese and develop
a conceptual model that will be evaluated and refined over the course of the study. Second, we will use a 3-
year, longitudinal design to quantitatively assess the role of post-resettlement risk and protective factors in the
relationship between pre-resettlement experiences and mental health among 200 Bhutanese aged 50 and older.
We will use a longitudinal study design to assess past exposure to war-related traumas/stressors in the country
of origin (Bhutan) and refugee camps (Nepal), current bio-psycho-social risk and protective factors, and mental
health outcomes at three-time points. Third, we will qualitatively explore the caregiving experience of Bhutanese
older adult caregivers and quantitatively examine the relationship between family caregiver mental health and
mental health. A family caregiver of each older adult will be enrolled in the longitudinal study (N=200) and
interviewed at the same three-time points as the primary study participant. We will assess the psychosocial
functioning of these caregivers over the duration of the study. Accomplishing these aims will increase our
understanding of the impact of forced displacement and immigration on long-term mental health and inform multi-
level interventions to address the psychosocial functioning of aging refugees resettled in the US. This has the
potential to reduce health disparities among aging immigrants from racial/ethnic minority groups."

 Monitoring intracranial pressure (ICP) and treating elevations in ICP to maintain adequate cerebral blood
flow (CBF), is the recommended standard of care following severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). ICP is measured
by a small pressure-sensitive probe inserted through the skull, with risk of intracranial hemorrhage and infection,
hence used only in comatose patients. The ability to monitor ICP non-invasively would improve global access to
ICP monitoring, allow for faster and more effective triage of trauma patients, extend ICP monitoring to patients
whose risk may be substantial but not enough to justify the invasive procedure. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound
(TCD), the current leading non-invasive alternative to invasive ICP monitors, is not sufficiently accurate, requires
specialized operators and is impractical for continuous monitoring. In this context, diffuse correlation
spectroscopy (DCS) a near-infrared diffuse optical method, has emerged as a promising alternative to estimate
ICP from the critical closing pressure (CrCP, the arterial blood pressure at which brain vessels collapse and
cerebral blood flow ceases) or the morphology of the pulsatile cerebral blood flow signal (pCBF). The main
barrier for widespread adoption of DCS for ICP measurements is the low signal to noise ratio (SNR) of currently
available technology, which limits source-detector separation to 2.5 cm, offering relatively low brain sensitivity
and strong scalp contamination, and requires pulse-gated averages of 50-60 cardiac cycles to extract clean
pCBF waveforms, compromising the morphological information. Building on our expertise and on our preliminary
results, we propose to develop a novel speckle contrast optical spectroscopy (SCOS) device, featuring pulsed-
laser sources and heterodyne detection, able to assess pCBF at 3.5 cm and 50 Hz with superior SNR (>100 x
gain over DCS). Moreover, we plan to integrate the SCOS device with our recently developed wearable near-
infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) device (FlexNIRS), which, by synergistically operating between SCOS camera
frames, will simultaneously measure pulsatile blood volume. As shown in our preliminary results and a recent
publication, the simultaneous measure of pulsatile blood flow and volume will allow separation of arterial inflow
and venous outflow, and further enhance pCBFi SNR and sampling rate, which, we hypothesize will improve ICP
estimation accuracy. Finally, the integration of SCOS and FlexNIRS will provide additional important biomarkers
to monitor brain health status on TBI patients, i.e., hemoglobin oxygenation, changes in cerebral blood flow,
hemoglobin concentration and oxygen consumption, cerebrovascular resistance, and cerebral autoregulation..
The successful realization of this state-of-the-art, non-invasive cerebral monitor will have a transformative role
in neurocritical care, especially in low resource and rural settings, by expanding access to ICP monitoring and
providing new monitoring indications to improve outcomes after TBI. Further, the prototype instrument developed
in this work will provide a strong basis for future clinical studies and translation into clinical practice."
10992885,"Through our End Diagnostic Overshadowing: Addressing manifestations of ableism in the healthcare context
program we aim to identify and create understanding of mechanisms underlying diagnostic overshadowing and
mitigate and reduce its effects. Diagnostic overshadowing—attributing symptoms to disability rather than a
potentially new or comorbid condition—is a result of ableism. It contributes to diagnostic errors (i.e., missed,
delayed, wrong diagnoses) that result in major causes of death in the US,12-14 and are estimated to cost
>$100B/year.15 Some diagnoses are prone to diagnostic error including vascular events, infections, oral
problems, and cancer.16 Among people with disabilities (PWD), specific populations are known to be at-risk,
including those with major mobility impairments,17 mental health concerns,18,19 severe visual impairments/
blindness,20 severe hearing loss/deafness,21 intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD).22 People from
marginalized racial and ethnic groups as a whole are at higher risk of diagnostic overshadowing,26-28 as are
people who have experienced trauma.29 And, PWD and people from marginalized racial and ethnic groups are
at higher risk for trauma.30-32 The intersections make PWD from marginalized racial and ethnic groups at
particularly high risk.33,34 We will use established methods of analysis of Current Procedural Technology (CPT)
evaluation and management (E/M) code differences and Joint Commission-style individual mock
tracers and environment of care tracers to identify underlying mechanisms of diagnostic overshadowing We will
analyze CPT E/M code differences by presence of the above specific disabilities and influenced by race, ethnicity,
gender and other intersectional identities followed by targeted retrospective chart reviews and staff interviews.
Using this information, we will update/develop and conduct in both inpatient and outpatient settings individual
mock tracers following the care of patients with the specific disabilities listed above and an environment of care
tracer focused on the environment surrounding diagnostic overshadowing. Mock tracer teams will provide
formative evaluation of care to involved staff.44 Using inductive thematic analysis 45 of notes from chart reviews,
interviews, and mock tracers, we will identify themes of mechanisms underlying diagnostic overshadowing. We
will partner with affected groups to confirm and prioritize themes through a Participatory and Planning Model
process46 and then develop targeted education programs and Electronic Health Record decision supports to
mitigate and reduce diagnostic overshadowing. We will evaluate CPT codes (quantitative), chart reviews (mixed
methods) and interviews and tracer results (qualitative) at Year 5 compared to Year 1 expecting changes. We
will evaluate mitigation efforts through 1) pre and post knowledge checks of usage of education programs and
2) descriptive pre and post data on use of specific EHR decision supports.47 If successful, we will have developed
a system for identifying and creating understanding of mechanisms underlying diagnostic overshadowing and
will have created specific means to mitigate and reduce its effects."
10993712,"The Global Burden of Disease estimates that ambient air pollution is responsible for over 4 million deaths per
year, yet regulators in the US, EU, India, and China have been reluctant to tighten standards, which can be
costly. Those costs and the observational nature of the epidemiology studies suggesting a tightening of
existing standards would be protective of the public’s health is a major reason for this reluctance. To date,
separate standards have not been set for particle components, and health impact assessments rarely
examine environmental equity because of the paucity of subgroup-specific concentration-response functions.
Further, studies on the effects of temperature on mortality and morbidity have focused on risk associated with
short-term exposure, and not longer-term effects which may be larger. We propose to address these gaps by
using national data (US Medicare and Medicaid data, and all age Death Certificate data from multiple states
geocoded to a census block group) on mortality and hospital admissions; to use causal modeling techniques
robust to omitted confounders by design; to extend methods for environmental mixtures to large data settings
and use them to assess nonlinear and interactive effects of exposures; to use state of the art models
estimating daily air pollution and temperature exposure for the contiguous US on a 1km grid for 18 years; to
use state of the art methods to estimate exposure error in the contiguous US, to use restriction and spline
methods to address low dose effects, and to develop and use state of the art measurement error correction
methods to account for exposure error when estimating these risks.
Specifically, we will use quasi-experimental designs (difference in differences and self-controlled) that control
for many unmeasured confounders, either by stratifying on subject (controlling for individual level fixed or
slowly varying covariates) or by stratifying on neighborhood (controlling for fixed and slowly varying
neighborhood level covariates), while continuing to control for measured covariates. For acute effects of
exposures, we will use instrumental variables to adjust for unmeasured confounding. We will access large,
ready-to-use datasets we have compiled, including national Medicare and Medicaid mortality and admissions,
and state-level geocoded death certificate data. We will use highly accurate national models we have
developed for daily pollution on a 1km grid, and increase resolution to 500 m. We will use a new mixture
model, fast Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR), to address pollution and temperature mixtures,
identify interactions and nonlinearities, and identify which exposures are most important (including which
particle components) for a given health endpoint. We will use state of the art measurement error correction
approaches (SIMEX) to identify biases in the concentration-response relationship due to exposure error. We
will supplement the BKMR approach with analyses restricted to observations below current standards, and
spline methods with propensity scores to determine whether causal effects continue below current standards."
10993722,"Project Summary:
Taste-transducing cells detect chemicals in our food and communicate this information to peripheral taste
ganglion neurons (taste neurons), which carry this information to the brain. The axons of taste neurons vary in
branching characteristics, some branching little and others branching a great deal. However, it is unclear how
these differing morphologies underly plasticity and/or function. Our goal here is to clarify the relationship between
taste neuron morphology, plasticity, genetic type, and function in order to gain insight into the peripheral
organization of the taste system. Taste neuron morphology may underlie differences in connectivity, but is also
likely regulated by plasticity. Even in adults, taste receptor cells undergo continuous renewal and must constantly
attract and connect to nerve fibers, and some variation in neuron morphology likely occurs as part of this process.
Additionally, differences between neurons in their branching likely have functional importance. For example,
simply branched neurons can only connect with a few taste-transducing cells, while heavily branched neurons
likely connect to many more taste-transducing cells. Currently, the significance of these differences in
convergence are unclear. In this project, we propose to investigate factors that regulate differences in taste
neuron morphology and branching characteristics between neurons and relate these factors to neuron function.
Specifically, in Aim 1, we will determine which aspects of the axon morphologies of taste neurons are stable and
which change over time. In Aim 2, we will determine which aspects of neuron morphologies are determined by
an intrinsic factor (i.e., cell type) and how this factor correlates with function. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine
which aspects of neuron morphologies are determined by extrinsic (i.e., neurotrophins) developmental factors
and how these features relate to neuron function. We hypothesize that branching inside the taste bud is regulated
by plasticity, while branching outside the taste bud is regulated by a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic
features, which influence taste neuron sensitivity and breadth of tuning."
10993727,"Although difficulty with nonverbal communication (NVC) is required for a diagnosis of autism at any age, no
evidence-based interventions exist specifically targeting these skills beyond toddlerhood. Thus, older children
and adults on the autism spectrum remain unsupported for a core challenge with wide-reaching func-
tional impacts. Our long-term goal is to develop and implement targeted interventions to improve NVC expe-
riences for autistic adults, yet two gaps in knowledge exist. First, before developing novel NVC interventions, it
is critical to evaluate prospective intervention options from the perspectives of autistic adults themselves; what
autistic adults want out of intervention remains unknown. Significant resources could be wasted if interventions
are developed without consulting the communities who will one day seek to benefit from them. Second, due to
the heterogeneity inherent to autism, a “one size fits all” intervention is not a realistic goal; rather, distinct profiles
of ability and disability are likely to map onto different intervention priorities, which could facilitate targeted, indi-
vidualized intervention development. This grant will address these gaps by establishing foundational knowledge
about (1) how autistic adults experience NVC, (2) what they want out of intervention, and (3) how patterns of
individual difference map onto patterns of impact and intervention priority. We will use an explanatory-sequential
mixed methods design (Quantitative → Qualitative), in consultation with autistic members of a community-aca-
demic collaborative, with two specific aims: (1) Discover data-driven behavioral profiles relevant to NVC impact
and desire for intervention that will inform how to best match individuals to interventions; and (2) Understand
autistic adults’ perspectives on NVC experience and intervention qualitatively. In Aim 1, a diverse sample of
autistic adults (n=400) will complete surveys about their communication skills, NVC experiences, and desire for
intervention. Machine learning regression and canonical correlation analysis will model individual predictors of
NVC impact and desire for intervention and identify combinations of individual differences most predictive of
contexts for which NVC intervention is desired. In Aim 2 we will re-recruit n=40 survey participants to complete
follow-up semi-structured interviews about their Aim 1 responses. Interviews will elucidate the specific nature of
problematic and successful NVC interactions; reasons why intervention is and is not desired; and preferred in-
tervention targets and formats. We will analyze interview data using thematic analysis; findings will be used to
develop community-drafted guidelines for NVC intervention development. Contributions will be significant be-
cause they will provide strong empirical and community-based justification for investing resources in support of
the adult autistic community. This research is innovative because it represents a substantive departure from
the status quo by starting with the opinions, experiences, and perspectives of the target population. Knowledge
generated will parse the heterogeneity of communication skills in autism, and has the potential to guide devel-
opment of individualized interventions to meet the greatest areas of need with the greatest chance of success."

The overall goal of this proposal is to dissect the molecular mechanisms of metabolic regulation of ATP-citrate
lyase (ACLY) and to characterize ACLY inhibitors for cancer therapy. ACLY is the predominant source of
nucleocytosolic acetyl-CoA, an essential building block for the production of fatty acids, cholesterol,
isoprenoids and protein acetylation. Elevated ACLY activity is found in metabolic disorders, cardiovascular
diseases and many cancers, prompting the development of several ACLY inhibitors. While many ACLY
inhibitors have been developed, only bempedoic acid, which forms an active bempedoyl-CoA adduct in
hepatocytes, has been approved by the FDA for therapeutic use. Risk of hepatocellular carcinoma is elevated
in individuals with metabolic disorders, many of whom may be candidates for treatment with bempedoic acid;
yet metabolic regulation of ACLY activity and its functional role in hepatocellular carcinoma remain poorly
understood. Elevated levels of ACLY acetylation at K540, K546 and K554 and phosphorylation at S455 and
S481, and retention of exon 14 encoding a region with S481, have also been correlated with cancer, thus also
suggesting roles for ACLY posttranslational and posttranscriptional modification in cancer metabolism. ACLY is
an ~500 kD multidomain homotetrameric enzyme that uses citrate, CoA and ATP cosubstrates to produce
oxaloacetate (OAA) and acetyl-CoA. Until recently, the lack of structural information on intact human ACLY has
hampered understanding of its molecular mechanism of catalysis and the structure-based development of
inhibitors. The Wellen lab recently reported on various disease-associated phenotypes associated with
dysregulated ACLY function; and the Marmorstein lab reported on the cryo-EM structures of ACLY in different
reaction states, along with associated biochemical and biophysical studies, to elucidate the molecular basis for
acetyl-CoA production by ACLY. The latter findings lead to several unresolved questions underlying the
metabolic regulation of ACLY and set the stage for the structure-based development of more potent and
selective ACLY inhibitors for therapeutic applications. These recent studies now position the Wellen and
Marmorstein labs to work together to resolve important gaps in knowledge in metabolic regulation and
inhibition of ACLY, through the following specific aims: (1) Evaluate the role of metabolic binders in ACLY
activity, (2) Determine the molecular mechanism of how posttranslational modifications and exon 14 retention
impact ACLY regulation, and (3) Evaluate the molecular mode of action of ACLY inhibitors. Together, these
studies will reveal the molecular mechanisms for how ACLY activity and regulation is mediated by the binding
of metabolites, and posttranscriptional and posttranslational modification and will lead to the rational
development of ACLY drugs to treat cancer."

Basement membranes are strong thin sheets of extracellular matrix, and they are found throughout the
human body: under epithelia, surrounding muscles and nerves and organs, and separating tissues. Their
structure and function are critical for many aspects of human health, including mechanical support of
tissues and muscles, embryonic morphogenesis, filtration of the blood in the kidney, blood-brain barrier
function, resisting tumor metastasis, and wound healing. The most prevalent protein in basement
membranes is collagen IV, which is crosslinked into a covalently-bound polymer network and gives the
basement membrane its mechanical strength. Basement membranes and Collagen IV are highly conserved
throughout the animal kingdom. Using Drosophila as a model, we recently found that there appear to be
two fractions of collagen IV, a core fraction that appears stable and a mobile fraction that is more
dynamic. In this R21 project, we will investigate the significance of these two fractions for the structure
and function of basement membranes and begin to unravel the mechanisms governing their different
stabilities."

outcomes for people with mobility disabilities
Project Abstract
Ableism, the act of discrimination and social prejudice based on presumed or actual impairment and/or
disability, is a pervasive and insidious force in clinical healthcare. Emerging literature points to multiple
factors that may contribute to ableism, however the mechanisms by which these factors impact the
health outcomes of people with disabilities have not been widely explored. Critical knowledge gaps exist
in understanding the relationships between lived experiences of ableism, biases of healthcare providers, and
both short- and long-term health outcomes. People with disabilities are a heterogeneous group with unique
experiences of ableism during healthcare encounters. As a first step towards investigating the mechanisms
through which ableism impacts health outcomes, we will focus on people with mobility disabilities
(PWMD), a disability group representing 1 in 7 adults. We will investigate ableism as a social determinant
of health in the context of rehabilitative care, evaluating its impact on self-perceived health status, depression,
anxiety, pain, participation, quality of life, and measures of healthcare utilization. Further, we will examine how
provider biases and practices impact patient outcomes, a necessary step to address ableism at a systems
level. This study will evaluate the relationships between self-perceived experiences of ableism, provider
biases, and health outcomes among PWMD.
 We will conduct a mixed-methods, observational study with a sequential explanatory design with 40
rehabilitation providers and over 400 PWMD across two study sites in Pittsburgh, PA, and Seattle, WA. We will
prospectively assess explicit and implicit disability biases of rehabilitation providers and then measure
perceived ableism and health outcomes of PWMD during episodes of rehabilitative care (Aim 1). We will
also evaluate the association between cumulative experiences of ableism and current self-reported health
outcomes among PWMD at a second data collection session using measures distinct from those related to the
episode of care (Aim 2a). Additionally, we will retrospectively analyze the electronic health records of our
cohort using cutting edge Natural Language Processing technology to detect patterns of potential bias
within provider documentation (Aim 2b). Finally, we will conduct qualitative semi-structured interviews
with PWMD to understand the lived experiences of ableism across contexts of rehabilitation and general
healthcare (Aim 3). Qualitative data will be used to contextualize quantitative results, map lived experiences to
health outcomes, and generate new theories about the role of ableism in provider-PWMD relationships. The
long-term goal of our work is to reduce disparities and maximize participation, health, and quality of life in
partnership with PWMD. This work will leverage our team’s multidisciplinary expertise, lived experience of
disability, and past work to fill a critical gap in understanding underlying mechanisms that perpetuate ableism in
healthcare so that more effective bias-mitigating solutions may be developed and evaluated in the future."

Maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States (US) is driven by health disparities along axes of race,
poverty, disability, socio-economic and sexual gender minority status. Such structural inequities also influence
career choices of underrepresented early-stage investigators, who may pragmatically avoid studying health
conditions that are hard to measure or difficult to fund. Intimate partner violence (IPV) is one such ethically and
logistically complex condition. Perinatal IPV has marked effects on incident hypertension, common mental
disorders, obstetric complications, and adverse birth outcomes. IPV was present in 57% of pregnancy-
associated homicides, and homicide is now the leading cause of US maternal death. Despite these preventable
deaths and years lost to disability, perinatal IPV remains underexamined in observational, interventional, and
population-based studies. Training a broad spectrum of early-stage investigators on measurement rigor and
ethical practice has strong potential to narrow this evidence gap.
“Restoring equity to measuring and preventing perinatal intimate partner violence” (Remap-IPV) is a
comprehensive, hybrid cohort training with tailored mentorship. The training approach uses constructivist, adult
learning techniques to facilitate dialogue and skills application. Trainees are matched with established IPV
investigators to co-produce a peer-reviewed manuscript or specific aims and outline for a research proposal.
Throughout the 18-month traineeship, Remap-IPV will build skills in ethical measurement of perinatal IPV and
extend the professional network of both new and established faculty in this field. The project leverages the
resources of two leading public universities: University of North Carolina and University of California, San Diego.
Our team of 20 core faculty have a demonstrated commitment to mentoring excellence and expertise in IPV
assessment across various disciplines: public health, nursing, medical ethics, obstetrics, clinical forensics,
psychology, psychiatry, social epidemiology, criminology, sociology, and health economics.
The longevity and scalability of the Remap-IPV training will be steered by a Translational Impact Group consisting
of experts in educational design, innovation, maternal health, and community engagement. The Remap-IPV
training model will be replicable for future cohorts and through a freely-licensed online curriculum that includes
comprehensive lectures, skill-development activities, mentorship approaches, and well-defined learning
objectives. Remap-IPV is designed to lay a strong foundation for ESIs in methodological rigor, ethical
considerations, and scientific perseverance necessary to conduct IPV research. This program will contribute to
the NIH IMPROVE initiative's aim to promote diversity within the next generation of maternal health scientists
and reduce preventable maternal deaths."
10993871,"Patients opting for TMJ disc removal face issues due to the absence of FDA-approved
replacements, leading to bone-to-bone contact and subsequent joint problems. Autografts, like
dermis-fat grafts, typically resorb within a year. Our goal is a secure disc replacement
alternative. Previous studies demonstrated rapid transformation of an acellular ECM scaffold
into TMJ disc-like tissue in canine and porcine models. The canine model, chosen for its hinge-
socket preventing implant migration, lacks human-like motions, and pig models have access
issues. Introducing the goat model, with human-like access and motions, addresses these
limitations. Proposed research focuses on the 12-month clinical endpoint, investigating the
impact of a pathogenic TMJ environment on remodeling a porcine SIS scaffold into a neo-disc in
goats. We aim to determine the long-term (6, 9, 12 months) functional remodeling of SIS
scaffolds in the TMJ, hypothesizing higher tensile moduli than dermis-fat autografts, even in a
pathological environment. Addressing a critical gap in understanding outcomes beyond 6
months is crucial for clinical translation. This work aims to provide a groundbreaking, safe TMJ
disc treatment, preventing joint damage and revolutionizing surgical management for TMJ
patients, with the potential to significantly improve outcomes."
10993878,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Immigrants experience significant health disparities which are exacerbated by a heavy stress burden which in
turn affects the epigenetic profiles of the immune system leading to chronic diseases. Cumulative stress burden
for immigrant’s ranges from immigration-related stressors to unique psychosocial, environmental, and everyday
challenges, all of which contribute to negative psychological and biological impacts on their health over the life-
course. Although social and environmental conditions have been established as key factors driving disparities in
health outcomes, the effects of stress and epigenetic change among immigrants remains poorly understood,
impeding the development of novel and robust intervention approaches aimed at reducing health disparities.
Epigenetic changes can act as surrogate markers for stress effect. However, very few studies have examined
epigenetic marks associated with stress among African immigrants. Ethiopians form one of the largest groups of
African immigrants in the US, yet this is the first study of this kind among Ethiopian American immigrants (EAIs).
The objective of this proposal is to quantify cumulative stress burden and determine DNA methylation associated
with stress among EAIs. We hypothesize that the DNA methylation profile in EAIs is associated with cumulative
stress. To address cultural differences and experiences and for a wider translation to the community, our bilingual
and bicultural multidisciplinary research team will work with relevant scientific partners connected to and/or part
of EAI communities in Cincinnati and Columbus OH to achieve two Specific Aims: Aim 1) Measure cumulative
stress burden and identify and define stress burden profiles among EAIs. Aim 2) Determine the association
between cumulative stress and DNA methylation. Our proposed study, involving a comprehensive set of
cumulative stress measures and genome- wide DNA methylation among an immigrant population, is the first
study among Ethiopian American immigrants. The study will provide new insights to address health disparities
among growing immigrant populations in the US informing novel and robust intervention approaches to reduce
chronic illness and associated sequelae for vulnerable populations. Our long-term goal is to better understand
how changes in psychological, social, environmental, and acculturative stressors affect the risk for chronic
diseases through epigenomic mechanisms."

Hearing loss is one of the most common problems associated with normal aging. Sensorineural hearing loss,
caused by damage or loss of inner and outer hair cells and characterized by raised hearing thresholds in older
subjects, is well known and can be diagnosed through audiograms or otoacoustic emissions (OAEs). However,
there is a subtype of hearing loss known as central or “hidden” hearing loss that similarly affects aged
individuals. Hidden hearing loss is so termed because those afflicted present with hearing deficiencies, but
have normal audiograms; their hearing problems are therefore “hidden” from normal diagnostic measures.
Although subjects with hidden hearing loss have normal hearing sensitivity, they struggle to detect and
understand sounds presented above a background noise, and struggle with localizing sounds in space. The
underlying cause of hidden hearing loss is not currently well known, but because of the common symptoms of
decreased sound localization abilities with spared hearing thresholds, it is thought in part to arise from
dysfunction in the auditory brainstem. We hypothesize that hidden hearing loss in aging subjects is a result of
dysfunction in the auditory brainstem, specifically a mistiming of the inhibition arising from the medial nucleus
of the trapezoid body (MNTB). To test this hypothesis, we will perform auditory measurements in Mongolian
Gerbils, an animal model commonly used in binaural hearing research because of its hearing range similar to
humans and their ability to utilize interaural time differences (ITDs) and interaural level differences (ILDs) as
humans do. We will perform auditory measurements such as OAEs, audiograms, and monoaural and binaural
auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and envelope following response (EFRs) to assess both the peripheral
hearing and binaural processing abilities of young and aged gerbils. We will also perform behavior tasks to
determine the spatial hearing abilities of these cohorts and correlate changes in behavior with potential
biomarkers of spatial hearing from our ABR results. Additionally, we will investigate if age-related dysfunction
arises from age-related changes directly to the auditory brainstem, a reduction of input from peripheral areas of
the auditory pathway, or both. To assess this, we will perform in vivo recordings from auditory brainstem nuclei
to directly measure the firing properties of neurons from the MNTB. We will also examine levels of cochlear
synaptopathy, a reduction in the synapses in the cochlea to the auditory nerve, in young and aging animals as
a metric of peripheral hearing ability. We expect to see a decrease of temporal fidelity of inhibitory neurons
from the MNTB in aging animals, which would correlate with an increase of cochlear synaptopathy, a reduction
of ABR waveforms confirming synaptopathy, and a decrease of spatial hearing performance in these animals.
Taken together, our electrophysiological, immunohistochemical and behavioral measurements will provide a
comprehensive understanding of the mechanism that drive age-related hidden hearing loss."
10926891,"Project 1: High-Dimensional Regression for Data Integration 
Abstract
Associated with high-dimensional omic (e.g. genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic) features there is a
rich set of functional and regulatory annotations, pathway information, and disease-specific knowledge 
from previous studies that is routinely used to interpret analyses of omic data. In this project, we 
propose to develop integrative regression methods capable of incorporating this array of external 
information a priori, rather than post hoc, to improve prediction performance, selection of predictive 
and associated features, and to gain insight into potential biological mechanisms in studies with highdimensional omic data. In our first Specific Aim we propose a general high-dimensional mixed 
modelling framework for integrating meta-features (e.g. functional annotations, pathways) into omic 
studies, with the flexibility to handle quantitative, categorical, and time-to-event outcomes, as well as 
the ability to accommodate correlated data through the inclusion of random effects. Our proposed 
approach brings together mixed modeling, high-dimensional regularized regression, and an empirical 
Bayes strategy that makes the direct estimation of tuning penalty parameters from the data analytically 
and computationally tractable. The proposed integrative models can be deployed in ‘predictive mode’ 
to develop diagnostic and prognostic signatures, or in ‘discovery mode’ to identify omic features 
associated with disease outcomes. We also propose an accompanying set of tools for inference and 
model interpretation. Our second Specific Aim focuses on integrative high-dimensional regression 
models for transcription-wide association studies (TWAS). We propose to leverage recent advances 
linking enhancers and other DNA regulatory elements and their proximal target genes to improve the 
prediction of genetically regulated gene expression with the goal of boosting the power and localization 
ability of TWAS. In our third Specific Aim, we focus on applications of the methods in Aims 1 and 2 to
several cancer datasets."
10926893,"Project 1: Integration of Omic Data to Estimate Mediation or Latent Structures 
Abstract
The omic era is upon us and population-based studies are moving rapidly to measure multiple types of data to 
explore the underlying connection between risk factors and outcomes. Integration of data from complementary 
avenues of research using novel statistical approaches will result in discoveries within each area of research, 
probe the area between, and push innovation forward. Overall, this project focuses on the development of 
statistical approaches for the integration of multiple omics data that are suspected, a priori, to act on a disease 
or trait outcome via mediation or a latent structured model. The approaches span the analysis of studies with 
multiple omic measures on the same individuals to summary statistics from omic data measured from multiple 
studies. In Aim 1, we will develop a multi-omic causal inference test (CIT) to facilitate its application to large 
multi-omic datasets measured on individuals to simultaneously model multiple risk factors and multiple 
mediators. In Aim 2, we will develop an integrative model to estimate latent unknown clusters aiming to 
incorporate multiple types of omic measures either measured cross-sectionally or at multiple time points to 
jointly estimating subgroups relevant to the outcome of interest. In Aim 3, we will estimate joint causal effects 
of intermediate factors or latent-outcome associations using summary statistics for multiple SNPs and multiple 
intermediates. We will leverage methodological developments from other projects within the overall program 
project and, using expertise and assistance from the computational and translation cores, we will develop
robust, computationally efficient, and user-friendly software for application to applied projects. Overall, these 
methods will have a direct impact on applied investigations by facilitating a better understanding of potential 
biological mechanisms driving underlying cancer etiology via identifying novel factors, estimating connections 
between those factors, and identifying subgroups of individuals with potentially different associated 
mechanisms."
10926895,"Project 2: Integration of Omic Data in the Analysis of Gene x Environment Interaction 
Abstract 
The availability of high-volume ‘omic’ data, including gene expression, metabolome, methylation, 
and microbiome, provides exciting opportunities to identify novel gene-environment (G×E) and 
omic × E interactions affecting cancer and other complex traits. For example, the FIGI colorectal 
cancer consortium has generated transcriptomic (gene expression) data on both normal tissue 
and colon organoids to inform the discovery of G×E and expression × E interactions for colorectal 
cancer in a sample of over 130,000 cases and controls, with exposure data on established risk 
factors including tobacco, alcohol, obesity, and red meat. The multi-ethnic cohort includes over 
215,000 subjects followed for up to 30 years, with biomarkers, metabolomic, and microbiome data 
available on selected subsamples and nested case-control samples of breast and colorectal 
cancer. In addition to potentially improving power for identifying novel interactions, the use of 
omic data holds promise to inform the biological mechanisms by which genes and exposures 
affect a particular trait. This project will develop two types of novel methods that leverage omic 
data to identify interactions in a genomewide scan. The first (Aim 1) considers one factor at a 
time (e.g. one SNP, one gene) and uses novel two-step screening/testing methods to discover 
G×E or omic × E interactions. The second (Aim 2) approach is a joint model considering SNPs 
and omic data simultaneously, using novel hierarchical modeling techniques to guide the 
discovery of G×E and omic × E interactions. For both Aims 1 and 2, we will consider the various 
types of exposure data that may be available, ranging from simple yes/no indicators from 
questionnaires to integrated exposure measures constructed using statistical models, with or 
without relevant omic data. Aim 3 will focus on applying the methods from Aims 1 and 2 to several 
cancer-related data resources, including epidemiological investigations such as FIGI and MEC 
and a clinical trial examining modifiers of treatment outcomes in colorectal cancer patients. 
Overall, this project will develop statistical methods to use both integrative omic and 
environmental exposure approaches to improve power for identifying novel G×E and omic × E 
interactions as well as to inform the biological mechanism by which these factors affect the risk 
or prognosis of cancer. We will leverage our collaborations on several cancer-related studies to 
guide our methods development process, to design realistic simulation studies for evaluating the 
methods, and to assure that methods we develop are translated into real-data applications."
11002931,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
During the past decade in Latin America, new yearly HIV infections rose 21%, and as of 2022, HIV infections
were still rising. Of the 3.8 million people living with HIV in the Americas, 2.8 million live in Latin America. The
HIV epidemic continues to be highly concentrated among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men
(GBM), especially in Mesoamerican countries such as Guatemala (9%), Belize (13.9%), Mexico (14.9%) and El
Salvador (16.3%). Research points to multiple co-occurring psychosocial and structural conditions, including
HIV- and sexuality-related stigmas that act as intertwined forces that potentiate HIV transmission among GBM.
This study addresses intersectional stigmas experienced by Indigenous GBM (IGBM) in Guatemala. This study
will adapt a patient-provider stigma-reduction intervention - Finding Respect and Ending Stigma around HIV
(FRESH). FRESH is workshop-based intervention that has been employed to reduce stigmas among healthcare
workers and GBM around the world, including a recent Spanish-language version in the Dominican Republic.
Guatemala is a diverse society in which close to 50% of the population identifies as Indigenous. Indigenous
Guatemalans who also identify as GBM, experience intersectional stigmas, including racial discrimination, which
increase vulnerability to HIV. Due to a crumbling public health system, and discrimination towards Indigenous
people at public hospitals, Indigenous traditional healers (ITH) are the first line of response to those seeking
health services. The adapted FRESH intervention, named KABAWIL in Maya K’iche language will be
implemented with IGBM and will include, for the first time, ITH. Our aims include: Aim 1: We will use the ADAPT-
ITT framework to adapt FRESH and produce the culturally tailored KABAWIL intervention. We will conduct in-
depth interviews (20 per group) and two focus groups with IGBM and ITH. Aim 2: We will use a randomized wait-
list control trial design to pilot test the intervention with 120 participants. Thirty IGBM and 30 ITH will be randomly
assigned to three KABAWIL intervention workshops (10 GBM + 10 ITH per workshop; n=60). The other 30 GBM
and 30 ITH will be assigned to the 3-month wait-list control. We will assess the intervention’s preliminary efficacy
on increasing HIV testing, PrEP uptake, PrEP/ART adherence, and decreasing experiences of stigma and
discrimination. Aim 3: Evaluate facilitators and barriers to the implementation of the KABAWIL intervention. We
will conduct a post-implementation, mixed-methods assessment guided by the Consolidated Framework for
Implementation Research (CFIR). We will conduct interviews with IGBM (n=10), ITH (n=10), and interventionists
(n=10) to identify contextual and organizational factors that may impact the feasibility and acceptability of the
intervention, and determine organizational/contextual fit for the design of a larger hybrid effectiveness
implementation trial to establish KABAWIL as a model for reducing intersectional stigmas and improve HIV
prevention and care for indigenous people throughout the Americas."

Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey (RU)-New Jersey Medical School (NJMS) requests funds to
purchase and outfit an automatic watering delivery system (AWS) to serve the needs of the current as well as
future expanding numbers of rodent cages in the Cancer Center (CC) building vivarium in Newark. The current
facility was built in 2004 with 2200 Individually ventilated cages (IVC) with city water provided through water
bottles. NJMS has seen a big increase in biomedical research and with it the need for use of animals in the
research. To accommodate the growing number of NIH funded investigators using animals, we have outfitted
the facility with high-density IVC caging, increasing the cage capacity of the facility to 6000 cages within the
existing footprint. Currently, the water source for the animals is city water that is bottled and autoclaved prior to
providing them to the animals. This task is very labor intensive and time consuming. Also, the increased
amount of water bottles increases the chances for repetitive motion injuries to our animal care staff due to the
many tasks associated with providing the water bottles- removing caps, putting on the caps, carrying heavy
baskets with the autoclaved water etc. An AWS that supplies chlorinated reverse osmosis (RO) water proposed
in this project will significantly reduce the labor costs (estimated 2 FTEs), improve worker safety, provide
constant and consistent high quality water and increase the rigor and reproducibility of research. The
animal care technician time savings will be redirected to more animal care needs. The labor cost savings will
result in less per diem costs for the investigators. The equipment requested fits existing facility dimensions
and utilizes most of the existing physical infrastructure. To ensure equipment operation Rutgers University will
pay for the annual maintenance contract for proper maintenance of the equipment."

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is a critical cancer control intervention, particularly in resource-
constrained health systems with limited access to screening and treatment services. Malawi, like many African
countries, has introduced a national HPV vaccine program targeting preadolescent girls – but coverage remains
very low. Clinician recommendation of HPV vaccination is a highly effective evidence-based intervention for
increasing uptake of the vaccine, but there is little information on how to encourage clinicians in low- and middle-
income countries to deliver this recommendation.
The Kupewa project (“prevent” in Chichewa) aims to (A) identify the optimal implementation strategies for
increasing clinician recommendation of HPV vaccination for girls and young women aged 9-24 who are living
with HIV in Malawi; (B) refine this set of optimized strategies by including information about the strategies’
implementability; and (C) ultimately identify the set of strategies that are effective, implementable, and show
sustained effects 18 months after the intervention ends. The study is informed by the Theoretical Domains
Framework and the World Health Organization’s Behavioural and Social Drivers (BeSD) of vaccination
framework.
To our knowledge, this would be among the first applications of intervention optimization alongside
implementation science, and among the first to be conducted in a low-income country. The project will leverage
a robust research partnership between institutions and highly-qualified investigators in Malawi and the U.S., with
engagement of partners from the Malawi Ministry of Health in all phases, from conceptualization to study
execution and results interpretation and dissemination.
Clinician-facing implementation strategies to promote vaccination recommendation in low- and middle-income
countries are understudied but urgently needed to accelerate HPV vaccination programs globally. This study will
provide much-needed insight into ways to promote clinician recommendation of HPV vaccination to the highest-
risk girls and young women in the country with the second-highest burden of cervical cancer globally."

PROJECT SUMMARY
Anhedonia—the diminished capacity to experience pleasure from normally pleasurable stimuli—is a
transdiagnostic symptom of multiple psychiatric disorders, including depression, schizophrenia and post-
traumatic stress disorder. The recent and rapid growth of anhedonia research is fueled by its alarming clinical
presentation: anhedonia is independently associated with increased risk of suicide, treatment resistance, and
reduced quality of life. Major depressive disorder and schizophrenia—disorders of which anhedonia is a cardinal
symptom—are linked with increasingly high levels of economic burden related to substantial health care costs
and unemployment. There is currently no clear biological definition of anhedonia. As a result, clinicians rely on
self-report measures with no clear established connection to its underlying neurobiology. While behavioral
reward processing deficits and dysfunctional reward circuitry have been observed in anhedonia, in-the-moment
reward responding is frequently preserved, suggesting that memory for the value of the experience may be
compromised. This prompts the central question of this proposal: to what extent is anhedonia a memory
problem? We propose to test a memory-based account for anhedonia as part of our goal to biologically define
the construct. We note that while it is unlikely that memory is the only basis for anhedonia (certainly there are
clear experiential aspects), it may be an understudied and underappreciated player. Critically, a well-defined
memory contribution can help identify novel treatment targets and pave the path to improving clinical practice
with biologically informed decision-making. We use a computational psychiatry approach, combining
mathematical modeling of behavior in novel paradigms with advanced neuroimaging and AI tools to identify and
validate biomarkers relevant to the prevention and treatment of anhedonia. We unite computational models of
value, reinforcement learning, and episodic memory, bridging across the RDoC domains of Positive Valence and
Cognitive Systems. Our aims are to: (1) Test the impact of anhedonia on value-modulated episodic memory and
its neural mechanisms using high-resolution whole brain fMRI; (2) Test the impact of anhedonia on memory-
guided decisions for reward and the associated neural mechanisms using high-resolution whole brain fMRI; and
(3) Test the impact of anhedonia on structural and functional connectivity measures as well as autonomic
regulation. We will also use AI/ML tools to create a multimodal library of predictive biomarkers for anhedonia.
Our ultimate goal is to develop a comprehensive, mechanistic, and actionable memory-based account for
anhedonia using new paradigms, computational models, high-resolution neuroimaging, as well as artificial
intelligence approaches to develop novel interventions and improve clinical practice.

11001617,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Each year, more than 500,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer (CxCa), a preventable cancer
caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) that disproportionately burdens low- and middle-income countries
(LMICs). Women living with HIV (WLHIV) are up to six times more likely to develop CxCa, making them an
especially important target population for prevention and control efforts. In Ethiopia, a national CxCa
screening program was established in 2016 and screening guidelines for WLHIV have recently been updated
to shift from visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) to human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing. There is
limited data on the provider or facility adherence to the “screen-triage-and treat” guidelines and algorithm for
HPV testing; Up to 30% of WLHIV screen positive for HPV and the proportions that are appropriately triaged
with VIA and treated if needed are currently unknown. Implementation challenges to CxCa screening, as
reported by health providers, include high variability in practices between screening sites, and insufficient
training and monitoring and evaluation. We seek to explore and address these challenges through an
implementation science study of point-of-care HPV self-sampling integrated with routine HIV care in
antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinics of hospitals, thereby leveraging established HIV care infrastructure for
improved cancer control of WLHIV. A mixed method situational analysis will be conducted to describe the
existing integration of CxCa screening with HIV care in hospitals, identify opportunities for optimization of the
integrated service, and assess facility readiness to improve the cascade of care. Project ECHO, a facilitated
virtual learner community of health professionals, will be used to promote experience sharing between five
hospitals of which two low-performing sites will receive intensive technical assistance to increase the
proportion of screen-positive individuals appropriately triaged and treated. Acceptability, appropriateness, and
feasibility (implementation outcomes) will be assessed as will ECHO (1) participation, (2) satisfaction, (3)
impact on knowledge, (4) impact on confidence, and (5) impact on professional practice. Finally, a costing aim
will evaluate the cost-benefit of Project ECHO and technical support to inform decision-making around the
sustainability of this approach to improved cancer control in people living with HIV. This study is consistent
with goals of the RFA-CA-23-033 FOA “Implementation Science for Cancer Control in People Living with HIV
in Low- and Middle-Income Countries” by identifying and addressing the unique public health needs of the
LMIC population through a situational analysis and by demonstrating potential for broader implementation of
integrated CxCa screening with patient-centered HPV self-sampling for WLHIV in LMICs and other low-
resource settings, considering scale-up and sustainability in terms of triage and treatment coverage,
implementation, and cost. By considering the entire screening cascade, this study will generate important
insights that go beyond screening uptake, to advance CxCa control for WLHIV in LMICs and to move the
needle on the elimination of an almost entirely preventable cancer that unjustly impacts sub-Saharan Africa."

Primary hereditary microcephaly, gray matter heterotopia, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, and
schizophrenia affect millions of individuals worldwide and have all been linked to improper neurodevelopment, a
tightly regulated process where temporal and spatial regulation of the cell cycle is integral to the production of
the right number and type of cells in the brain. Temporal dysregulation such as significant mitotic delay in cortical
progenitors has been known to result in Tp53 induced apoptosis in response to activation of the Mitotic
Surveillance Pathway (MSP), depleting the neural progenitor pool and reducing the number of neurons
produced. Spatial dysregulation, such as alterations of location where progenitors divide within the developing
cortex, has been shown to alter cortical organization. Mutations in genes involved in cilia biogenesis, affecting
neural progenitor signaling, have been shown to result in an array of conditions such as macrocephaly and
polymicrogyria. I use multiple mutant mouse models that affect the centrosome-related functions of progenitor
division speed, cilia production, and neocortical localization to better understand how dysregulation of those
processes affect cell fate and cortical organization both when the MSP is active and inactive. The amount of time
mitosis is delayed in my models varies depending on the allele that is knocked out, with a subset of the mitotically
delayed models additionally having their progenitors delocalized and spread throughout the developing cortex. I
will use these mouse models to: Aim 1A: Characterize how these genetic manipulations affect cortical
development using gross and immunofluorescent analysis techniques. Aim 1B: Perform single-cell RNA
sequencing in conjunction with CFSE and EdU labeling, elucidating the transcriptome of all cycling progenitors
(EdU), and progenitors based on the number of divisions it has gone through since they were in contact with the
ventricular surface (CFSE). Aim 1C: Investigate how location of progenitors influence gene expression by using
the spatial transcriptomic method, MERFISH. Thus, I hypothesize that the centrosome-related functions of
progenitor division speed, cilia production, and localization ensure spatiotemporal regulation of
corticogenesis, and when perturbed, uniquely change neural progenitor expression profiles, altering
fate specification and cortical organization. Having both active and inactive MSP models will allow the
investigation of progenitor fate in two different directions. With an active MSP, the time progenitors are delayed
in mitosis will be linked with the number and type of progenitors that are able to avoid MSP activation and
differentiate, illuminating which mature neuron types are produced for a given mitotic delay time. With the inactive
MSP models, all progenitors will be able to proliferate and differentiate. I will be able to link alterations in time
and location of progenitor division to changes in the neural progenitor pool population and the resulting number,
type, and destination of mature neurons. By using transcriptomic methods, I will additionally be able to see how
the transcriptome of progenitors change as a result of cilia loss, mitotic delay, and centrosome loss."
11001800,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Tobacco use remains the leading modifiable risk factor for preventing cancer globally,
particularly among people with HIV (PWH). In Lao People's Democratic Republic (Laos), 61%–80% of male
PWH and 3%–10% of female PWH smoke cigarettes. PWH who smoke in Laos currently have no theoretically
and empirically based smoking cessation support. Thus, implementing sustainable and evidence-based
smoking cessation interventions for PWH in Laos is critically needed. There is substantial evidence that mobile
health (mHealth)- based smoking cessation interventions are effective, cost-effective, and affordable. We
developed a scalable and affordable mHealth-based automated treatment program (MAP) to support Lao and
Cambodian smokers to quit smoking. The MAP involves interactive, tailored, personalized content (text
messages, photos, and videos) delivered via a smartphone app. Along with effective cessation treatments, it is
imperative to implement procedures to identify patients who smoke and to facilitate connections to treatment.
One such approach pioneered by our team is Ask-Advise-Connect (AAC, asking patients about smoking at
every visit, briefly advising those who smoke to quit, and connecting them to treatment), which showed great
impact in our US studies. The purpose of this application is to compare 2 smoking cessation implementation
strategies in 8 antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinics in the 5 most populous provinces/regions across Laos, using
a hybrid type-2 pragmatic effectiveness-implementation study and a parallel cluster randomized trial
design. Specifically, we will compare an AAC approach paired with our previously developed MAP (AA-MAP) to
an AAC approach paired with less resource intensive printed self-help material (AA-SH). To guide our
implementation work, we use the Practical, Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM), which
expands the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework to
include more key, multilevel contextual factors relevant to program implementation. Aim 1 is to evaluate the
reach and effectiveness of AA-MAP versus AA-SH. Reach is the proportion of PWH who smoke and are
willing to make a quit attempt that enroll in treatment. Effectiveness is the proportion of enrolled participants
(n=1,200) who achieve biochemically confirmed point prevalence abstinence 6 months after enrollment. We
hypothesize that compared with AA-SH, AA-MAP will have a lower reach but will be more effective. We will
also estimate the real-world impact (impact = reach × effectiveness) of each intervention. Aim 2 is to evaluate
other multi-level implementation outcomes (e.g., adoption, implementation fidelity, and sustainability) of AA-
MAP and AA-SH in the ART clinic setting using mixed methods. Aim 3 is to conduct a comprehensive
assessment of the resource use and costs of implementing AA-MAP and AA-SH and calculate the absolute
and relative cost effectiveness of the 2 intervention strategies. The project has the potential to transform HIV
care delivery throughout the country and to reduce tobacco-related cancers and other morbidities."
11001641,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Episodic memories formed from a single experience can be used to guide behavior throughout the lifetime.
Memories are thought to be encoded during ‘online’ periods of awake exploration and subsequently consolidated
during sleep. In the mammalian brain, the initial formation and consolidation of episodic memories rely on the
CA1 region of the hippocampus. Pyramidal neurons in CA1 (CA1PNs) form spatially selective firing fields (place
fields, PFs), which serve as the cellular basis for memory encoding. Despite decades of research, subcellular
mechanisms underlying memory encoding (Aim 1, F99 phase) and consolidation (Aim 2, K00 phase) remain
poorly understood. CA1PNs receive excitatory synaptic inputs that interact through somatic action potentials
that backpropagate into the dendrites (bAPs) and dendritic plateau potentials (PPs) that initiate in distal
dendrites. Recent evidence suggests that PFs in CA1PNs are formed through behavioral timescale synaptic
plasticity (BTSP) by generating conjunctive PPs and bAPs. These plateau-burst (PP-bAP) events are robust
signals for synaptic plasticity (SP). While BTSP is emerging as a critical cellular mechanism driving PF formation,
a significant knowledge gap exists concerning whether and how bAPs and PPs differentially contribute to BTSP.
To address this major knowledge gap, in the F99 phase, I will test the hypothesis that synaptic plasticity requires
the interaction of bAPs and PPs during BTSP by measuring SP at single synapses after decoupling somatic and
dendritic activity using a combination of tools that allow electrophysiological manipulation of somatic membrane
potential and optogenetic manipulation of afferent inputs to distal dendrites in behaving mice. For my postdoctoral
work in the K00 phase, I will study the subcellular mechanisms responsible for refining and consolidating the
plasticity acquired during awake conditions into long-term memory during sleep. To study this, I will build on my
skills gained in the F99 phase, by combining intracellular recordings and dendritic imaging with extracellular
physiology and modeling to relate single-cell activity to different sleep states. Ultimately, I aim to provide a deeper
understanding of fundamental mechanisms controlling dendritic integration of synaptic activity and develop direct
experimental approaches linking sleep-specific dendritic activity to memory consolidation. These goals directly
align with the BRAIN Initiative objective of linking neural function and behavior by combining new
electrophysiological and imaging technologies to image single cells at high resolution across time. These
experiments will deepen our understanding of how physiological signals are produced and transmitted in
dendrites and will also help to identify key mechanisms behind neuronal diseases such as Alzheimer's and other
pathological memory-related disease states. The support of the DSPAN F99/K00 award will allow me to merge
techniques spanning multiple fields in neuroscience to further our understanding of memory formation and
consolidation, and ultimately provide me with the necessary training to achieve my long-term goal of becoming
an independent investigator."
11004223,"Neurocognitive impairment (NCI) is one of the most prevalent and deleterious complications observed in
adolescents and young adults (AYA) with perinatally acquired HIV (PHIV), even despite viral suppression. Gaps
in our current understanding of what drives NCI in virally suppressed people with PHIV greatly limit our ability to
develop targeted and tailored interventions for it. A growing body of research indicates that immune dysfunction
(ID) may drive NCI in virally suppressed HIV. Peripheral blood markers of persistent and chronic ID (i.e.,
inflammation [e.g., CCL2, IL-8, and TNF-α] and immune activation [e.g., sCD14, sCD163]) are higher in people
with HIV and associated with NCI. The preponderance of this research, though, has been among adults with
horizontally acquired HIV (HHIV) from high-income countries. HHIV is distinctly different than PHIV where
infection began prior to physiological, immunological and brain development. Non-HIV sources of ID, such as
medical (e.g., malaria, SARS-COV-2), social (e.g., early trauma, stigma, poverty), and environmental (e.g., air
pollution) adversities are also all independently associated with NCI but have been overlooked as potential
modifiers of ID on NCI in HIV. Yet, many people with PHIV experience a high burden of these adversities,
especially in Uganda – where the proposed study will take place – and other countries in sub-Saharan Africa
(SSA). Enduring multiple co-occurring adversities (i.e., syndemics) as well as timing, duration and type of ART,
may affect the relationships between HIV and ID, and thus NCI, differently in PHIV vs HHIV, but research has
not addressed this. To date, most studies on ID and NCI in HIV have focused on host and genetic factors, while
overlooking contextual factors known to contribute to ID and NCI. No studies to date have directly compared ID
and NCI in AYA populations of the same age with PHIV and horizontally acquired HIV in SSA. Making this
comparison will allow us, for the first time, to delineate how lifelong HIV infection acquired prior to key
physiological, immunological and brain development, as well as timing, duration and type of ART, may alter
immune system responses and how NCI manifests in adolescence and young adulthood, as well as how
exposure to chronic adversity may affect the relationship between ID and NCI in HIV-infection. Addressing this
knowledge gap is critical to developing targeted and developmentally appropriate interventions for NCI in AYA
with PHIV, as the effects of exposure to individual and combined adversities may impact ID and NCI differently
in AYA with PHIV. Not only will this study help determine critical intervention targets for ID and NCI, it will also
cohere a group of early and established Ugandan and US investigators focused on optimizing AYA outcomes
and provide research opportunities and mentorship to medical, psychiatry and psychology students at Makerere
University for collaborative development of next-generation US and Ugandan trainees in brain health and ID
across the lifespan."
11005999,"Project Summary/Abstract
The proposed project relates to the development of an innovative, single-operator pneumothorax
decompression device that aims to improve the safety and time efficiency of therapeutic decompression. The
aim of neonatal pneumothorax decompression is to alleviate built-up air pockets inside the chest wall that
threaten the functionality of vital organs. Current procedures require a medical provider to assemble a
functional decompression “device” using multiple off-the-shelf modular components, which can be inefficient
and time consuming in emergency situations. Two medical providers are generally required to achieve the
therapy, which involves insertion of a needle into the chest wall with no feedback of needle depth. In addition,
the needle is subject to movement, potentially harming surrounding lung tissue, as stability of the needle
within the chest cavity is based solely on provider skill and steadiness. An innovative prototype device will be
designed, manufactured and evaluated."
11006021,"ABSTRACT
Pancreatic cancer (PC) is an orphan disease with a 5-year relative survival of 11.5% and relative survival for
metastatic PC of only 3.1%. Although surgical resection provides the best curative option, <20% of PC patients
are eligible for surgery at diagnosis. Front-line chemotherapy treatment with FOLFIRINOX results in a median
overall survival (mOS) of only 11.1 months and is associated with severe toxicities that limit patient treatment.
Overall, new therapies are urgently needed to fulfill this unmet medical need and extend OS beyond 11 months.
Despite success in hematologic malignancies, immunotherapy has not yet significantly improved clinical
outcomes in PC due to conditions surrounding solid tumors. Marker hypothesizes, based on clinical trials to date,
that chemotherapy can modify the tumor microenvironment to promote T cell infiltration, T cell activation, and
tumor cell killing. Marker proposes MT-601, a novel T cell therapy that simultaneously targets 6 tumor-associated
antigens (TAAs) highly expressed in PC thereby minimizing tumor escape. Manufactured from the patient’s own
apheresis material, MT-601 recognizes target cells via native (non-engineered) T cell receptors (TCRs), by
interacting with both class I and II MHCs (CD4+ and CD8+ T cells), leading to killing of cells expressing TAAs, as
well as the activation of other immune cells. In vitro studies show that MT-601 was far superior in controlling
growth of PANC1 pancreatic cancer cells versus control conditions. More importantly, preliminary clinical data
from Marker’s TACTOPS trial in pancreatic cancer patients demonstrated a signal of efficacy including 1
Complete Response (CR) and 3 Partial Responses (PRs) out of 13 PC patients treated. Epitope spreading was
observed, likely leading to more durable responses than other cellular therapies. To date, multiple TAA (mTAA)-
specific T cells have been shown to be safe in >200 patients with various cancer types. Therefore, Marker
Therapeutics proposes to use MT-601, an improved mTAA-specific T cell product for PC in order to improve
patient outcomes. Combining MT-601 with front-line FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy may overcome current
limitations of immunotherapy in PC.
This grant proposes a Phase 1, open-label study to evaluate safety and efficacy of MT-601 combined with front-
line chemotherapy in metastatic PC patients. Specific Aim 1 assesses primary and secondary safety and
efficacy outcomes in PC patients treated with front-line chemotherapy (FOLFIRINOX) in combination with MT-
601. Specific Aim 2 will correlate biological characteristics in the product profile with clinical safety and efficacy
outcomes. Successful completion of this grant will provide clinical proof of concept for MT-601 as a treatment for
PC patients and support future clinical trials leading to future BLA filing and commercial approval of MT-601."
11005913,"SUMMARY
Metastatic disease is responsible for ~90% of cancer deaths and is the primary determinant in the life-limiting
aspect of cancer. One validated driver of metastasis is miRNA-10b, a non-coding RNA associated with
metastatic progression in numerous preclinical and > 100 clinical studies. Transcode has developed a novel
therapeutic agent (termed MN-anti-miR10b and commercially developed as TTX-MC138) that relies on specific
eradication of metastatic tumor cells. MN-anti-miR10b consists of antagomirs against miRNA-10b conjugated
to a unique delivery platform, called TTX, which is optimized for the targeting of primary and metastatic tumor
cells. Transcode’s proprietary and patented technology allows for the selective targeting of microRNA-10b in
metastatic cells independent of their type or primary tumor origin. Numerous preclinical studies conducted by
Transcode have shown that MN-anti-miR10b mediates significant miR-10b inhibition in vivo eliciting a marked
and durable regression of lymph node and distant metastases in mouse models of breast cancer with no
evidence of systemic toxicity. Specifically, as few as four to six weekly treatments with MN-anti-miR10b in
combination with low dose chemotherapy led to complete regressions of detectable metastases. Of critical
importance, following elimination of metastases and following discontinuation of therapy, no evidence was
found to suggest recurrence over the remaining natural life span of the animals. In addition, similar studies in
mouse models of pancreatic cancer were conducted with complete responses, defined as complete regression
with no disease recurrence. Finally, initial evidence of safety and therapeutic activity was confirmed in
companion cats with spontaneous metastatic breast cancer. TransCode has completed critical exploratory IND
enabling studies in rats, dogs, and non-human primates with radiolabeled MN-anti-miR10b. Specifically, the
information generated resulted in FDA authorization in support of an ongoing microdosing Phase 0 clinical trial
in patients with advanced metastatic cancer. At this point, TransCode has conducted initial studies in patients,
demonstrating delivery of the drug to metastatic lesions. The Phase 0 trial involves a single injection of a
microdose of Cu-64 labeled MN-anti-miR10b which allows for direct visualization in vivo via PET-MR imaging,
with a primary endpoint of determining the %ID/cc of the therapeutic that is delivered to the metastatic lesions.
Based on the outcome of formal pIND communications with the FDA Office of Oncologic Diseases, the current
application will support full IND-enabling studies, generation and filing of an IND application (Aim 1), as well as
the Phase Ia dose-escalation trial in patients with advanced solid cancers (Aim 2). These funds will accelerate
the program towards commercialization by enabling safety studies and potentially obtaining efficacy signals
that could enable FDA approval of a first-in-class therapeutic against metastatic cancer of diverse primary
disease origins."

Translational safety studies in novel nerve imaging agent for radical prostatectomies
 In this two-year proposal, we will complete IND-enabling studies for NerveLight, a nerve imaging agent.
We apply single dose NerveLight interstitially (topically), intra-operatively for ~ 15 min at the beginning of
radical prostatectomies, then wash the excess. There is no marketed, soluble, non-device nerve imaging
agent. NerveLight is comprised of a Near InfraRed (NIR) dye that fluoresces in the 800 region, attached to
recombinant human Nerve Growth Factor (rhNGF). In preliminary canine studies, we have shown that the dye
can be detected in clinical systems designed to image indocyanine green (ICG). It is known that rhNGF binds
selectively to tropomyosin kinase A (TrkA) high affinity receptors expressed at the distal ends of nerve tissue.
When the NGF/TrkA complex is endocytosed, dye attached to rhNGF is moved to nerve cell bodies. In
separate repeat doses, dye and rhNGF when given as eye drops are safe. We previously showed that
NerveLight can be (i) visualized and is selective in all rat studies (n=103); (ii) of which n=46 were in radical
prostatectomies; and (iii) completed non-GLP dose-range finding studies in rat to statistical significance in rat.
 Project Milestone. The Project Milestone is to confirm safety – exposure to NerveLight toxicity
exposure in tissue - per FDA Guidance in two species, rat and dog - in GLP, nonclinical IND-enabling studies.
 Hypothesis, Specific Aims. We hypothesize that safety will be confirmed in GLP toxicology and in
vitro safety pharmacology studies in rat and dog. We will test that hypothesis in the following Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1. In Aim 1.1, using the same imaging and surgical protocols as previously, we will conduct non-
GLP, pilot, dose-range finding studies in anesthetized, male adult, non-neutered naïve dogs in an “open”
procedure (acute, non-survival). In Aim 1.2, after incision, NerveLight is applied, washed, then prostate and at-
risk nerve tissue are harvested, then non-GLP imaging and molecular histology are done. Success criteria for
Aim 1 are to: (i) determine canine dose via absorption and visualization for the Dye-Adduct-Ratio (DAR2)
variant determined in rat; and (ii) use co-localization to confirm agent is in target nerves. Specific Aim 2. In
Aim 2.1, we will conduct GLP toxicology and safety pharmacology in rat and dog per established translational
nonclinical design. Success criteria are that all results fall within 10% of values for hematology and
biochemistry known for both species. In Aim 2.2, we use the same established histology methods as in Aim
1.2, here to GLP, to statistical significance, again using co-localization to confirm that agent is target nerves.
 Next steps. Prior to beginning this Project, we will have selected a not-novel imaging system in which
NerveLight can be detected (no funding requested). Upon completion of an IND, we will test three Single
Ascending Doses of NerveLight in a clinical Phase 1 study in men undergoing radical prostatectomies.

The growth rate in the number of people diagnosed with Parkinsonism is substantial. Estimates indicate that
from 1990 to 2015 the number of Parkinsonism diagnoses doubled, with more than 6 million people currently
diagnosed. By 2040, there will be 12 to 14 million people diagnosed with Parkinsonism. Parkinson’s disease
(PD), multiple system atrophy Parkinsonian variant (MSAp), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are
neurodegenerative forms of Parkinsonism, which can be difficult to diagnose as they share similar motor and
non-motor features, and they each have an increased chance of developing dementia. In the first five years of a
PD diagnosis, about 58% of PD patients are misdiagnosed, and of these misdiagnoses about half have either
MSAp or PSP. Since PD, MSAp, and PSP require unique treatment plans and different medications, and clinical
trials testing new medications require the correct diagnosis, there is an urgent need for clinical and clinical trial
ready diagnostic markers. A promising approach to identify different forms of Parkinsonism is diffusion magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), as there is no contrast drug, the technique is safe, and is already used clinically in
traumatic brain injury and stroke. Using this approach is advantageous because MRI acquisition is compatible
with standard clinical practice when evaluating suspected Parkinsonism in patients and can be performed rapidly
on widely available 3 Tesla MRI systems. Automated Imaging Diagnostics is developing a commercial software
called neuropacs™, a high-throughput brain image processing and AI-powered precision diagnostic tool to assist
in the diagnosis of PD, MSAp, and PSP. Results from our Phase I program have established clear technical
feasibility and the data indicate neuropacs™ is robust in the clinical classification of PD, MSAp, and PSP with
>90% accuracy. Our next goal in this Phase II project is to perform a pre-market field evaluation of neuropacs™.
We will perform a clinical performance study to determine how the addition of neuropacs™ into workflows of
board-certified neurologists affects diagnostic accuracy of PD, MSAp, and PSP. A second major objective is to
validate the accuracy of neuropacs™ for predicting gold-standard pathological diagnosis. This is an important
validation step because other available technologies fail to distinguish patients using pathological markers of
Parkinsonism, including dopamine deficiency and brain atrophy. This Phase II project will further our efforts to
develop a high-precision clinical decision support tool for Parkinsonism and position our company to achieve
FDA biomarker approval and device qualification milestones."
11032050,"Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, wherein states have the option to expand
Medicaid coverage to adults with household incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty
level, has been shown to reduce mortality rates nationwide. From 2014 to 2018, mortality rates
dropped 3.6% more in states that expanded Medicaid than those that did not. Although the impact
of Medicaid expansion on mortality is well-documented, its impact on mortality disparities remains
underexamined. The overarching goal of this study is to identify the relationship between Medicaid
expansion and rural-urban ethnoracial disparities, while also estimating the mediating role of
poverty alleviation in this relationship. This study is significant because it: 1) focuses on mortality
disparity reduction instead of the simple reduction of mortality, 2) analyzes the impact of Medicaid
expansion on intersectional mortality disparities, meaning disparities found at the intersection of
multiple health disparity populations (e.g. black and rural), and 3) identifies the indirect effect of
Medicaid expansion on intersectional mortality disparities through poverty alleviation. The
innovations of this project center on three contributions. First, it will provide an explicit analysis of
mortality disparity reduction as opposed to just aggregate impacts on different groups; Second,
the study will generate an updated and improved cost-of-living adjustment for the Supplemental
Poverty Measure, as well as county-level estimates of the Supplemental Poverty Measure. Third,
the study will provide a robust analysis of the mediating role of poverty in the relationship between
Medicaid expansion and intersectional mortality disparity reduction. The project will be completed
through three specifics aims. In Aim 1, we will estimate the effect of Medicaid expansion on
ethnoracial mortality disparities by rural-urban status from 2011 to 2019. We will do so using time-
varying difference-in-difference design with marginal prediction analysis via census data and
restricted data from the National Vital Statistics System. In Aim 2, we will improve the cost-of-
living adjustment in the existing Supplemental Poverty Measure and estimate the improved
measure at the county level from 2011 to 2019. We will do so using restricted American
Community Survey and Current Population Survey data housed in the Federal Statistical
Research Data Centers to create a county-specific cost-of-living adjustment and corresponding
county-specific poverty thresholds. In Aim 3, we will estimate the mediating role of poverty
reduction in the relationship between Medicaid expansion and rural-urban ethnoracial mortality
disparities from 2011 to 2019. We will do so by integrating our estimates of the supplemental
poverty measure with our difference-in-difference models from Aim 1."

Our objective is to develop a blood-based diagnostic for early diagnosis and classification of Frontotemporal
Lobar Degeneration (FTD).
FTD is a common presenile dementia that afflicts an estimated 60,000 patients in the US with most cases
occurring between the ages of 45 and 641. For patients under 65, FTD is the second most prevalent subtype of
dementia after Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). FTD is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease characterized
by progressive loss of behavior and language skills associated with degeneration of the frontal and anterior
lobes1. Currently, an accurate diagnosis of FTD takes approximately 3.6 years1. This is mainly because
diagnosis of FTD is costly and complex, involving neurological tests, brain imaging, a full set of blood work (to
rule out other causes for the symptoms), and sometimes a lumbar puncture plus electrophysiologic testing. As
a result, up to two thirds of patients fail to complete testing, contributing to the ~58% of all FTD patients
remaining undiagnosed2.
In AD, studies reveal that various aggregated protein variants, commonly found in the brains of patients, can
also be detected in the blood, showing promise for the development of a blood-based diagnostic. So far,
studies have focused on single markers over a multiparameter approach, with no consensus as to which
marker is superior3-9. Currently, there are no known biomarker assays available to diagnose FTD. It is our
hypothesis that a simple blood test identifying distinct variant oligomeric biomarkers will enable more accurate
diagnosis of FTD.
Recently, our project team applied novel biopanning techniques to identify single chain antibody variable
domain antibodies (scFvs) that bind to disease-specific variants of four key neuronal proteins implicated in FTD
and related dementias: Tau, TDP-43, Aβ, and α-syn. Our novel scFvs react only to the variants found in brain
and plasma samples from FTD patients, but not cognitively normal controls10-12. More interestingly, a subgroup
of antibodies is able to distinguish the two major FTD subtypes, FTD-Tau and FTD-TDP. Our preliminary
results suggest that a blood biomarker approach may prove to be an extremely valuable tool to diagnose FTD
earlier in disease progression, and potentially identify FTD subtypes.
Building from this innovative work, this proposal is designed to develop a blood-based diagnostic for early
diagnosis and classification FTD. The specific aims are to: 1) develop a low-volume, antibody-based assay for
quantitation of plasma protein variants; 2) identify the optimal biomarker set for early diagnosis and
stratification of FTD subtypes; 3) measure the assay performance in a blinded study of ante-mortem FTD
patient samples. A novel blood test for early diagnosis and classification of FTD would provide a significant
advancement for a clear unmet medical need."

UbiquiTx is developing a programmable, modular therapeutic platform for the direct modification of proteins of
interest (POIs). Leveraging advances in artificial intelligence, protein engineering, and mRNA as a therapeutic
modality, this platform allows for the engineering of enzymes to precisely recognize and ‘edit’ POIs by
installing/removing post-translational modifications (PTMs). As one therapeutic application for this technology,
UbiquiTx seeks to enhance the immune targeting of diseased cells through the upregulation of selective antigen
presentation on the cell surface. T cells play a central role in immunosurveillance against viruses, other
intracellular pathogens, and cancers by recognizing short peptides presented by major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) class I molecules. These antigenic peptides are generated from proteins processed through the
ubiquitin-proteasome system, then loaded onto MHC I molecules and transported to the cell surface for
immunosurveillance. Global downregulation of antigen presentation on the cell surface is a major mechanism by
which cells escape this immune surveillance, allowing diseased cells to proliferate. Thus, overcoming MHC-I
downregulation and restoring antigen presentation represents a promising avenue for enhancing the efficacy of
and patient response to immune-based therapies.
UbiquiTx’s Chimeric Ligands for Induced Proximity (CLIPs) comprise a computationally designed guide peptide
targeting a specific POI that is fused with a protein modification enzyme component. Preliminary data has
provided compelling proof-of-concept, demonstrating the platform ability to design high-affinity peptide binders
to POIs, that swap out modification enzymes and deliver CLIPs as an mRNA therapeutic using a lipid
nanoparticle (LNP) vehicle. In this Phase I project, UbiquiTx will utilize the platform to upregulate the presentation
of disease-associated peptide antigens by MHC-I, enhancing the immune surveillance of diseased cells. CLIPs
will be designed and evaluated to promote the degradation of three key POIs: WT1, PRAME, and E7. WT1 is an
intracellular, oncogenic transcription factor present in a wide range of leukemias and solid cancers, while PRAME
is a cancer-testis antigen that provides a target for immunotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia. E7 is a human
papillomavirus (HPV)-derived protein and target for the treatment of HPV-driven cancers. Evaluating these
targets will demonstrate UbiquiTx’s platform modularity, ability to target proteins with variable expression, as well
as degrade endogenous host- and virus-derived oncogenic proteins. The proposed Specific Aims are: 1. Develop
and characterize ubiquitinase CLIPs (ubiCLIPs) for WT1, PRAME, and E7 and perform in vitro characterization
to assess target engagement and protein degradation. 2. Evaluate WT1 antigen presentation and recognition by
TCRm. UbiquiTx’s collaborator, Dr. David Scheinberg, will assess the effect of the top performing WT1 ubiCLIPs
on peptide MHC (pMHC) presentation and recognition by TCRm in relevant cell lines; also, the effects on the
immunopeptidome will be measured, with emphasis on target peptides and related proteins."

SLB is the leading scientific society with a focus on leukocytes and their roles in the pathophysiology of
acute and chronic diseases. No other scientific meeting regarding study of the immune system focuses on the
leukocyte with the breadth and depth of the SLB, so the annual meetings sponsored by SLB fill this void.
Therefore, SLB is the premier society in the field of leukocyte biology and convenes annually to promote scientific
exchange among researchers and support the career development of trainees and junior investigators. Funds
derived from this proposal will be distributed in the form of travel awards that will provide much needed assistance
to facilitate the attendance of young investigators and trainees. The essential goals of the annual meeting
include: 1) advancing original research and related scientific endeavors in the field of leukocyte biology and host
defense, 2) promoting the career development of junior and new investigators interested in leukocyte biology, 3)
disseminating information about the field to the wider scientific and lay audience, and 4) encouraging the
translation of basic research in leukocyte biology to applications in the clinic. These goals will be achieved
through three Aims: Aim 1 is to provide an innovative and scientifically progressive program, in a collegial forum,
to address the latest developments in leukocyte biology. The agenda will include a total of 4 Plenary Sessions
and 8 Concurrent Sessions with a total of 20 invited speakers. Aim 2 is to provide an opportunity for new
investigators and trainees to interact closely with established scientists. There will be numerous events and
formats for mediating career development and networking activities at the meeting. Aim 3: To promote diversity
and inclusion in the field of leukocyte biology by cultivating the participation of women, underrepresented groups
and disadvantaged individuals. The Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) committee will sponsor workshops and
awards to encourage the participation of women and those from underrepresented backgrounds. In sum, the

10999844,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this proposal is to investigate how gene expression dosage on the X chromosomes is regulated
during embryonic and extraembryonic development and how its deregulation impairs the feto-maternal interface
within the placenta. X-chromosome dosage compensation in female placental mammals occurs through two
epigenetic processes: X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), which induces the inactive X chromosome (Xi), and X-
chromosome upregulation (XCU), which increases the expression of the single active X chromosome (Xa) to
match the gene dosage of autosomes. XCI happens twice in mouse development. First, an imprinted mechanism
silences the paternal X (imprinted XCI, iXCI) in pre-implantation embryos. iXCI is reversed in epiblast cells of the
blastocyst and induced again on either the maternal or paternal X in embryonic cells upon implantation (random
XCI, rXCI); in contrast, extraembryonic cells, which form the placenta, maintain iXCI. XCU accompanies both
iXCI and rXCI. XCI mechanisms are well-understood, but those governing XCU remain largely elusive. The long
non-coding RNA Xist is the master regulator of both forms of XCI. Conserved repeats of Xist, termed A-F, are
critical for Xist’s function and recruit specific proteins to block transcription and induce a heterochromatin state.
For instance, the B-repeat recruits repressive proteins including polycomb complexes and is required for
heterochromatin formation and Xi compaction. We showed that without the B-repeat, silencing of most genes on
the Xi is impaired in vitro. To investigate the functional consequences of increased gene expression from the Xi,
we created mice with a B-repeat deletion (ΔB-Xist). Our preliminary data show that the ΔB-Xi disrupts the
development of the placenta of female embryos. Female ∆B-Xi placentas have severe depletion of the junctional
zone (JZ) and limited trophoblast invasion of blood vessels, causing female-specific embryo mortality and growth
retardation. In the ΔB-Xist mouse model, developmental defects only manifest in the placenta, even though gene
expression on the ΔB-Xi is increased in placental and embryonic tissues. Our data suggest that Xa expression
is typically decreased in cells with the ΔB-Xi and that this does not happen in the JZ, suggesting that XCU
regulation varies in different cell types and providing a possible explanation for the JZ-specific sensitivity to X-
chromosome dosage. Here, we will follow up on these exciting findings by further defining the role of the Xist B-
repeat in the placenta (Aim1); exploring the chromatin state on the wildtype and ΔB-Xi and the crosstalk between
the Xi and Xa in embryonic and extraembryonic tissues (Aim 2); and uncovering mechanisms underlying JZ
dysplasia in placentas of mouse interspecies hybrids (Aim 3). Overall, our work will elucidate the role of XCI and
XCU in the regulation of the feto-maternal interface and explain the high X-dosage sensitivity of the JZ."

The hallmark of epilepsy is recurrent seizures, i.e., paroxysmal attacks of abnormal brain electrical activity that
are associated with high morbidity and premature mortality. In addition to the direct morbidity of seizures,
people with epilepsy must also contend with the ever-present uncertainty about when the next seizure will
occur. The unpredictability of seizures represents a significant and disabling feature of epilepsy. Despite
decades of research, there is no established method for determining when a seizure could occur. Akin to
weather forecasts that estimate the probability of rain, seizure forecasts that quantify the likelihood of seizures
over a future temporal window could increase the quality of life for patients and families living with epilepsy, so
they could plan around a seizure event. A forecast could help patients and families prepare for, or even
mitigate upcoming seizures. The overarching goals of the present proposal are (1) to elucidate the relationship
between biochemical changes in saliva (a readily available biofluid that reflects systemic chemistry) and
electrophysiological features that determine seizure likelihood (recorded from a Responsive Neurostimulation
(RNS®) System) and (2) to leverage these relationships to develop effective seizure forecasting methods that
will empower people with epilepsy with the unprecedented ability to anticipate and prevent seizures. We have
strong preliminary data from people with epilepsy that several saliva chemicals exhibit novel multidien (multi-
day) and circadian (~24-hour) concentration changes that correlate with periods of increased seizure
likelihood. Our central hypothesis states that a latent biochemical variable for seizure likelihood can be
detected in people with epilepsy using serial salivary sampling. We will pursue the following specific aims: (1)
establish biochemical signatures of multidien seizure likelihood and develop effective seizure forecasting
approaches; and (2) establish biochemical signatures of increased seizure likelihood over the circadian cycle.
Successful completion of this project will significantly advance the fields of chronobiology, metabolism, and
epilepsy by: (a) identifying novel multidien and circadian rhythms in biochemical and metabolic pathways in
people with epilepsy and healthy controls, (b) linking these changes to possible causes of seizures, and (c)
using these changes to forecast seizures and define a more effective standard of care. The expected positive
impacts on public health will be to (a) empower people with epilepsy with the ability to anticipate and prevent
seizures, (b) provide researchers with validated saliva sample collection and analysis approaches, and (c)
discover ground-breaking biochemical insight into the human chrono-metabolome. Detailed knowledge about
the chrono-metabolome is expected to fuel innovative studies on various episodic brain disorders that place a
large burden on society, like migraine, cluster headaches, affective disorders, and substance use disorders."

People living with HIV (PWH) living in the global south on modern first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART)
experience significant increases in body mass index (BMI). Obesity contributes to adverse health outcomes,
including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension. Interventions that promote physical activity (PA)
are a particularly compelling strategy to address obesity and reduce the risk of cardiometabolic disease (CMD),
but remain relatively untested, and are not part of most regional HIV treatment guidelines. The scientific goal
of this K43 project is to develop and pilot-test a wearable-based PA intervention to reduce obesity and improve
CMD among PWH and obesity on dolutegravir (DTG)-based ART in rural South Africa. I am a postdoctoral fellow
with a PhD in Exercise Science and training in exercise physiology and HIV epidemiology leading to 15
publications (13 first-authored). My long-term career goal is to become a global expert in the development of
low-cost and locally-contextualised interventions to promote PA among PWH in low-resource settings. To realise
this goal, I will gain further training in 1) data science methods to measure PA using wearable devices 2) PA
behavioural intervention development, and 3) the conduct and evaluation of clinical trials to promote PA and
improve CMD outcomes in PWH. I will do so with mentorship from a team of world-class experts in these areas,
didactic training, and conduct of the following specific aims: To establish patterns of PA and sedentary
behaviour among PWH and obesity on DTG-based ART to inform the development of a PA intervention
(Aim 1). I will use accelerometers to assess PA indices and sedentary behaviour among 50 obese PWH on DTG-
based ART in rural South Africa. Our primary outcomes of interest will be mean steps/day, mean daily energy
expenditure, mean metabolic equivalents (METs)/day and sedentary behaviour. To develop a PA intervention
for obese adults living with HIV on DTG-based ART in a rural setting (Aim 2). I will use mixed methods to
refine an existing PA promotion intervention for PWH by combining information gleaned from Aim 1, results from
focus group discussions with Aim 1 participants and clinic nurses, data from a systematic review on PA among
PWH that I am leading, and expert opinion. To assess the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy
of a PA intervention to promote PA among obese PWH on DTG-based ART in a rural setting (Aim 3), I will
randomize 80 obese PWH on DTG-based ART in a ratio of 1:1: to standard of care (including information on
benefits of PA for health), or the contextualised, wearable PA intervention, derived in Aim 2. Primary outcomes
will be feasibility and acceptability. Secondary outcomes will be change in PA patterns and CMD markers, quality
of life and mental health. Completing these aims will lead to development of a contextualized PA intervention to
reduce CMD risk among PWH in South Africa and provide requisite data for an R01 application I will submit in
year 4 of the application to transition to research independence."

To continue efforts of Specific Aim 1 as stated in U01CA244314, a new mouse model recently commercialized
by GenOway will be used to perform key experiments testing the potential therapeutic effects of anti-human
CD3 Fab fragments derived from the monoclonal antibody OKT3 specific for the ectodomain of human CD3.
The mouse model in the C57BL/6 background consists of a knock in manipulation to substitute murine genes
encoding for the CD3, and  subunits of the TCR/CD3 complex with chimeric genes encoding for the fusion
of human ectodomains with murine transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains for each of these three CD3
subunits. The KI mice present normal development of functional mature T cells that are targetable with anti-
human antibodies specific for the ectodomain of human CD3, such as the mAb OKT3. This model has been
validated by others as T cell targetable when using anti-human CD3 specificities. Specifically, in this model B
cell tumor cells can be killed by T cells when using bi-specific IgG reagents designed to bind and crosslink
human CD3 ectodomain and tumor epitopes. Our current data generated with the support of our U01 award
indicate that the OKT3 mAb derived reagent Mono-OKT3-Fab, a Fab fragment controlled for monovalence,
possesses the capacity to promote anti-tumor immune responses against patient derived xenograft models of
non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) in immunocompromised NSG mice when they carry human T cells
autologous to the human NSCLC grafts. GenOway B6 hu-ms CD3 mice will be purchased to test anti-tumor
effects of Mono-OKT3-Fab in the presence of intact immune system tolerant to autologous tumors with fully
functional T cells expressing the human ectodomain of the CD3 subunit of the TCR/CD3 complex. The goal is
to determine the potential therapeutic effects of Mono-OKT3-Fab against cancer when targeting functional T
cells in tumor hosts that are immunocompetent and tolerant to the tumor. Positive results in the GenOway
model, in conjunction with our current data in immunocompromised mice, would make a solid case to pursue
further steps towards clinical translation of Mono-OKT3-Fab as a novel T cell targeted immunotherapy against
cancer."

EsperImage, a startup company out of Washington University (WUSTL), will develop efficient and flexible data
registration and modeling procedures to complement their high fidelity, wearable, optical technology that
transcends limitations of both previous optical neuroimaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
tools to provide naturalistic brain imaging in adults and children. A neurodevelopmental disorder affecting 1/36
children in the general population, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) presents highly heterogeneous phenotypes;
however, core features are impaired development of social-communicative skills plus repetitive behaviors and
restricted interests. Additionally, early difficulties with visuo-motor integration and motor imitation may be strongly
associated with impairments of social communication widely reported in individuals with ASD. Because early
interventions in toddlers with ASD have been proven to result in improved outcomes, innovative methods for
early detection of the alterations in brain function underlying ASD prior to manifestation of behavioral symptoms
are necessary to advance treatment strategies and improve prognoses. Current brain mapping methods such
as fMRI offer promising sensitivity yet pose significant methodological challenges in studies of awake, interacting,
and moving children due to the loud, constraining environment and susceptibility to motion-induced artifacts.
Optical neuroimaging provides a potential surrogate for fMRI. However, image quality with traditional optical
technology, functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), systems had been lacking in comparison to the gold
standard of fMRI. Development of high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT), a tomographic version of
fNIRS, has dramatically improved image quality, and maps sensory, motor, and cognitive networks with fidelity
comparable to fMRI throughout the outer 1 cm of the cortex. Despite these advances, application of HD-DOT to
naturalistic studies in children has been limited by large opto-electronic consoles and bulky fiber optics. Several
wearable fiber-less fNIRS instruments are becoming available commercially, but all have multiple deficits,
including a lack of automatable data registration and modeling such as those proposed herein.
This Phase-I STTR project will develop commercialization-ready, robust, & efficient data registration and
modeling tools for WHD-DOT devices that match performance of fiber-based HD-DOT for use in pediatric studies
of neurodevelopmental disorders. Long Term Impact: The data registration and WHD systems together will
enable a better understanding of disease mechanisms as well as monitor response to therapy in the developing
brain. The Aim 1 goal is to develop flexible 2D-camera-based photogrammetric array-anatomy registration. The
Aim 2 goal will be to develop photogrammetric atlas-derived anatomical models. We will validate the registration
and modeling methods in healthy adults and autistic/non-autistic children to establish feasibility through mapping
distributed brain activity in untethered participants. This will establish an essential data registration and modeling
product for WHD-DOT commercialization development in a follow-up Phase-II proposal."

Decreases in endogenous estrogen production during and after menopause or cancer treatment is associated
with decreased lubrication and thinning of the vaginal tissue, making it sensitive, friable, and inelastic.
Vulvovaginal Atrophy (VVA) leads to pain during sex, which contributes to lower libido, abstinence, strained
relationships, and often depression. VVA affects up to 90% of all peri- and postmenopausal women, which
represents up to 44.6M women in the US alone. By 2025, VVA is predicted to impact between 369-990M
postmenopausal women worldwide. VVA not only causes pain during sex, but it can also make it uncomfortable
to sit, stand, exercise, or urinate, significantly affecting quality of life whether women are sexually active or not.
Nearly 75% of breast cancer survivors (BCS)—1.4M women in the U.S.—receive adjuvant estrogen-suppressing
treatments to prevent cancer recurrence. These treatments exacerbate VVA, resulting in poor therapy
compliance and thereby placing these women at high risk for cancer recurrence. Hormone therapy (HT), the
most efficacious treatment for VVA, is associated with a higher risk of cancer, and therefore absolutely
contraindicated for BCS. Over-the-counter (OTC) lubricants and moisturizers are disdained by users as messy,
temporary, and simply not effective enough for the severity of symptoms endured. There is a critical need for an
affordable, non-hormonal, and readily adoptable treatment for women with VVA. Madorra Inc. has developed a
novel, non-hormonal, non-invasive medical device to answer these concerns and treat VVA. The Madorra
Therapy System was developed in response to a well-vetted unmet clinical need for postmenopausal women
and BCS on estrogen-suppressing treatments. The Madorra Therapy System is the first technology to use
therapeutic ultrasound to treat VVA, enabling a safe, effective at-home treatment option. Madorra’s device uses
therapeutic ultrasound to support vaginal health by increasing vasodilation and blood flow to the vagina, resulting
in increased lubrication in the near term, and improvements in tissue health with continual therapy. The Madorra
solution leverages the physiologic mechanisms of the body’s own lubrication pathway and ultrasound’s ability to
increase blood flow to treat VVA without the side-effects and risks associated with HT. Madorra proposes the
following Specific Aims for this SBIR Direct-to-Phase II project: 1) Update design of the Madorra Therapy System
to improve operational settings for enhanced, reliable ultrasound therapy based on feedback from prior clinical
trials and 2) Conduct a Madorra device efficacy and safety study demonstrating positive clinical effect and no
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs). The project framework aligns with FDA requirements for clearance, which have
been defined through discussions with the FDA. Accomplishment of these aims will prove the safety and efficacy
of the Madorra device and establish its usability among the primary target adopters: BCS and women suffering
from severe VVA."

Phrase Health is a clinical decision support (CDS) analytics company that empowers health systems to
efficiently incorporate scientific knowledge into high value clinical care through iterative, data-driven
improvements. CDS is a process for enhancing health‐related decisions and actions with pertinent, organized
clinical knowledge and patient information. While CDS has improved outcomes in sickle cell disease,
myocardial infarction, and many other diseases, its impact has been inconsistent. Continuous evaluation of
CDS is critical to achieve consistent improvement in outcomes, but evaluating CDS is burdensome for health
systems and often not performed. To address these challenges, Phrase Health developed a product called
Outcomes that offers a self-service guided walkthrough for quality improvement (QI) advocates of variable
experience levels to (1) rigorously evaluate the impact of CDS on clinical outcomes and (2) convert data-driven
insights into action. The approach has early market traction with advanced technical users. However, user
feedback cites a need for “out of the box” QI templates (defined as abstracted definitions for CDS
interventions, cohorts, measures, and their associations) to provide more structure and guidance. To address
this market demand with a high-value product, we will generate a library of “out of the box” QI templates that
target the inpatient management of diseases in the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP)
populated by both customer-generated content and ones authored by the study team.
In Aim 1, we will translate two clinical use cases already established by partner systems within our platform: (1)
inpatient management of pneumonia and (2) inpatient management of congestive heart failure (CHF).
In Aim 2, we will use our authoring platform to develop two de novo projects: (1) inpatient management of
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and (2) inpatient management of acute myocardial infarction
(AMI). We will calculate the time and costs associated with developing a new QI project template using our
authoring platform.
At the end of this project, we will have established the start of a library that translates clinical guidelines into
care delivery via “out of the box” QI templates for a set of diseases tied to significant financial incentives, but
also assessed the necessary investments required to scale to more disease templates. These data will begin
to address the market’s demand for accessible QI tools linked to electronic workflows and quantify future
investment needs, allowing us to commercialize and accelerate the translation of knowledge into better health
outcomes and support improved health system profitability in a value-based reimbursement environment."
11005669,"ABSTRACT
The gold standard treatment for large full thickness skin loss (FTSL) due to burns involves autologous tissue
transfer in which the patient serves as their own donor. However, such treatment may be challenging due to
limited availability of full thickness skin donor sites; thus most of these wounds are closed using split thickness
skin grafts (STSG), which contain only a fraction of the native dermal thickness, leading to suboptimal functional
outcomes. Dermal Replacement Scaffolds (DRS) aim to recreate dermis, thereby restoring normal skin anatomy.
These cell-free products serve as a scaffold for the infiltration of cells from the wound bed that organize to a
functional, vascularized neodermis tissue, able to support a STSG. The critical barrier to progress in this field is
to create a scaffold that 1) promotes rapid cellular infiltration and angiogenesis required for neodermis formation
in full thickness wounds, and 2) increases the efficiency and quality of healing in acute large burns.
To address this significant clinical gap, Fesarius Therapeutics, Inc. has developed DermiSphere™, an innovative
DRS product that will regenerate dermis in full thickness skin loss wounds significantly and meaningfully
faster (≤7 days) than the regeneration achieved using the market-leading DRS product, Integra® (14-28 days).
Our customer interview process has revealed additional requirements from a DRS that are currently
unmet/partially met: (1) ability to close the wound in a single procedure (2) ability to temporize the wound, (3)
ability to close difficult to heal wounds. Our preliminary data have demonstrated in a swine model of FTSL that
DermiSphere, unlike any other commercially available DRS, successfully supports complete STSG take
when the two components are applied simultaneously. In addition, a small animal model of FTSL showed
that DermiSphere supported rapid and sustained lateral as well as vertical cell invasion, resulting in successful
STSG “take” in challenging cases of wound beds with avascular portions. A remaining challenge in acute burn
wounds, unlike other causes of FTSL, is that simultaneous grafting is often not feasible. Adding a protective layer
that can be removed when it is clinically feasible to perform the graft, days to weeks later, will significantly improve
the clinical utility of DermiSphere and improve wound healing. Once dermis has regenerated it can be covered
with a thin skin autograft, yielding skin that is more flexible, functional, resilient and aesthetically superior than
wounds healed with Integra or STSG alone. Given the successful completion of these preliminary studies,
DermiSphere is now primed to expand its indication into challenging full thickness wounds such as burns to
expand the scope of product use. The overall goal of this SBIR Phase I proposal is to demonstrate
feasibility of DermiSphere as a device for the management of acute major burn wounds. The data
generated in these studies will directly inform Phase II development work including conducting powered animal
efficacy studies. The resulting commercialization will significantly improve clinical outcomes, decrease the
number of reconstructive procedures necessary, and reduce patient suffering and costs."
11006184,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There are currently no effective vaccines or antiviral drugs for most of the viral diseases afflicting
human. Development of new therapy is challenging and expensive, and often complicated by
drug resistance. It is now known that viral transcripts contain many highly structured RNA
elements in both the coding and noncoding regions, and they play key roles in the viral life cycle.
Many of these elements are highly conserved and, thus, they are attractive new targets that
potentially have lower likelihoods of viral resistance development. Targeted RNA degradation
(TRD) is an emerging strategy in recent efforts to further discover new antiviral small molecules
with privileged scaffolds and better resistance profiles. However, early-stage TRD drug discovery
has been hindered by current high-throughput screening (HTS) assay technologies designed for
protein targets. Virtually all cell-based drug screens used minigene reporters that rely on
luciferase or fluorescent protein signals for assay read-out. Minigene reporter design is
straightforward but minigene reporter requires mRNA export to the cytosol and protein translation.
This significantly increases the rate of false hits per screen since compounds that inhibit global
protein translation machinery or RNA export will also impact reporter read-out. Assays that
monitor endogenous RNA levels are low-throughput or time-consuming, involve multiple steps,
and not readily adaptable for high-throughput SM screening. Thus, there is an unmet need for a
new cell-based HTS assay platform that monitors target RNA turnover directly, reflects real-time
RNA dynamics, and compatible for different types of RNA and different TRD approaches. For
proof-of-concept, this project aims to develop HTS-compatible reporters that can measure drug-
induced changes of RNA levels of dengue and influenza viruses, two global pathogens with
different genomic structures and life cycles. The ultimate product of this SBIR project will be a
cell-based HTS assay platform that can accelerate the early-stage discovery of TRD drugs toward
previously intractable viral diseases."
10976389,"Abstract:
Chronic visceral pain is a defining feature of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) that is currently considered as a
disorder of brain-gut interaction. Although pain is the most common driver of healthcare visits for IBS
patients, the current treatment options are often ineffective and associated with side effects. The use of
potent opioids for visceral pain has been reported to be associated with higher morbidity and mortality than
other pain conditions and contribute to the opioid epidemic. Although the etiology of IBS is not clearly
understood, the current studies indicate that neuroinflammation in gastrointestinal tract plays a critical role in
the pathogenesis of visceral pain. Gut inflammatory mediators modulate the intestinal nerve system, leading
to long-lasting functional alterations after resolution of the inflammatory insult. Among inflammatory
mediators, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) is a “master regulator” and found to be implicated in both
peripheral and central sensitization during pain induction in preclinical pain models and significantly elevated
in some IBS patients especially patients with post-infection/inflammation IBS. This preclinical and clinical
evidence supports the development of therapeutics targeting gut TNF-α for the treatment of IBS pain.
Fzata has developed a novel oral biotherapeutic, FZ006, an engineered probiotic yeast Saccharomyces
boulardii that secretes a neutralizing antibody against TNF-α. We demonstrated that oral FZ006 delivers anti-
TNF to gut and exhibited exceptional efficacy on relieving visceral pain in several animal models. To develop
FZ006 as a safe, non-addictive, first-in-class, oral therapeutic to treat chronic visceral pain, we propose the
UG3/UH3 plan with the final aim of an IND submission requesting clearance for phase I clinical trials.
Specifically, in the UG3 phase, we will determine the effective dose range of FZ006 and validate therapeutic
efficacy in humanized mice; perform small-scale manufacturing and generate a well-characterized research
cell bank; and prepare and submit pre-IND meeting request with the FDA. In the UH3 phase, we will
manufacture FZ006 under GMP to generate drug substance and drug product for clinical trials; perform
stability assessment and GLP toxicology studies; plan for first-in-human trial; and finally submit IND application
to the FDA for approval. Our ultimate goal is to develop FZ006 as an effective, safe, convenient, and non-
addictive oral therapeutic to treat chronic visceral pain in IBS patients."
10978098,"SUMMARY
Untreated and inadequately treated pain has substantially increased as a problem in the US over at least the
last 20 years. Increasing fears around prescribing opioids have also contributed to inadequate analgesic
treatment. Importantly, often chronic pain and major depressive disorder (MDD) are comorbid. Therefore,
discoveries of previously unknown neural circuits that can be targeted to address not only nociceptive discomfort
but also the affective component of chronic pain and its interactions with depression remains an important area
of focus for research. We recently showed that the lateral habenula (LHb) is a brain region that contributes to
both acute nociception and the aversiveness of chronic pain. The LHb also plays a role in behavioral models of
depression in rodents and has been targeted for deep brain stimulation to treat MDD in humans. LHb neurons
generally fire more in response to noxious stimuli and aversive behavioral states. We recently found that a
glutamatergic input from the lateral preoptic area of the hypothalamus (LPO) to the LHb is activated by noxious
stimuli, and inhibiting LPO → LHb neurons relieves the mechanical hypersensitivity induced by a neuropathic
pain model (spared nerve injury, SNI) in male rats. Inhibiting LPO → LHb also generated a conditioned place
preference in male and female animals with SNI, but not the control animals. This suggests that targeting this
circuit should have less abuse liability compared to agents that act on neural circuits that produce reward in
control animals. Here we propose to investigate the projections out of the LHb that transmit the pain signal
compared to the projections that modulate depression-model-related changes in behavior. While many have
studied the direct and indirect projections from the LHb to the dopaminergic systems and dopamine systems
contribute to pain and relief signaling, the LHb also sends a direct excitatory projection to the parabrachial
nucleus (PBN), an important component of the pain processing circuitry. The PBN receives nociceptive inputs
from the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and transmits pain signals to the central nucleus of the amygdala.
Therefore an LHb input to the PBN is a direct route for the LHb to have a strong impact on both sensory and
affective components of pain. The LHb also projects to the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), which is strongly
implicated in MDD in humans and depression models in rodents. Our preliminary findings show that the
projections to the PBN and DRN are from mostly non-overlapping sets of LHb neurons, making interactions
possible but not necessary. Here we propose to systematically investigate the contributions of the LHb → PBN
and LHb → DRN to nociception and motivated behaviors at the anatomical, neurophysiological, and behavioral
levels. We will make these measurements in control animals, animals with SNI, and animals treated with
repeated aversive restraint stress (a model for inducing depression-related behavioral changes). Together this
proposed research provides an opportunity to examine the neural circuit basis for the clinically established
relationship between pain and depression and to determine how to modulate these circuits for therapeutic effect."

There is a large unmet need for fast and effective point-of-care (POC) molecular diagnostic (MDx) testing for
congenital and adult acquired syphilis. Current syphilis detection methods utilize dark-field microscopy and/or
serum antibody tests that are performed in a centralized lab, require a trained operator, have inadequate
sensitivity and specificity without confirmatory reflex testing, or have long turnaround times on the order of
days. These challenges prevent clinicians from obtaining immediate and definitive test results to provide
patients with the correct treatment before patients leave the clinic.
The goal of our proposal is to develop a POC PCR-based syphilis assay as part of a multiplexed genital ulcer
disease (GUD) assay panel on GMR biosensors and to determine the best sample type or pooling of sample
types, for molecular detection of congenital, secondary, and latent syphilis. GMR biosensors are
magnetic-based field sensors that provide several advantages over conventional fluorescent and optical-based
detection methods. They offer lower background noise and a higher signal-to-noise ratio due to sample matrix
insensitivity. Additionally, GMR biosensors do not need complex and expensive components for signal readout
and processing or light compensation that are required for more traditional methods. Therefore, our
MagChipRTM platform can be made truly point-of-care, portable, affordable, and accessible by reducing
footprint and cost while maintaining a simple user workflow for untrained operators. This platform has
previously demonstrated successful multiplexed detection of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria
gonorrhoeae (NG), Trichomonas vaginalis (TV), and Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) in a single test.
Given the advantages of our platform, and our knowledge and skill sets in developing GMR-based molecular
assays, we aim to achieve the goal of our proposal with the following Specific Aims: 1) Develop POC
multiplexed PCR/GMR-based molecular assay for Treponema pallidum and other pathogens causing genital
ulcer disease, and 2) Clinical validation of GUD assay in patients with primary syphilitic lesions and discovery
of novel biospecimens and/or pooled specimens for various syphilis disease stages. Ultimately, this assay
panel will be run on our fully automated, raw sample-to-result MagChipRTM platform to provide clinicians with
diagnostic tests results in 20 minutes and enable them to give patients immediate and definitive treatment
before their patients leave the clinic. This assay would be one of the first commercially available POC NAAT for
syphilis, and in combination with our other STI assay panels, we hope to offer clinicians and patients with a
solution for comprehensive STI testing."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause of
dementia, affecting over 6 million Americans. While the pathological hallmarks of AD include β-amyloid
plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles, the appearance of hyperphosphorylated (“pretangle”) tau in the
noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) and loss of LC volume are the first detectable AD-like changes in the
human brain, and coincide with the onset of prodromal AD symptoms such as including arousal/sleep
disturbances, anxiety, depression, and agitation prior to frank cognitive impairment. Catastrophic LC
degeneration is ubiquitous later in disease when memory loss is evident. The goal of this proposal is to answer
two critical questions in the AD field: (1) Why are LC neurons vulnerable to developing pathology and dying in
AD, and (2) how does their dysfunction and degeneration contribute to prodromal and cognitive symptoms.
Catecholamine neurons, including the LC, are unique in their expression of neuromelanin (NM), a pigment
comprised of catecholamine metabolites, heavy metals, lipids, and protein aggregates. NM is an important
biomarker of LC neurons in AD, as NM-sensitive MRI contrast is used as a proxy of LC integrity. However,
because NM is not naturally produced in rodents, we know very little about how it might make neurons
vulnerable in AD. We have developed a viral vector expressing human tyrosinase (hTyr), which drives NM
production in the mouse LC. In Aim 1, we will determine how NM affects LC integrity. In Aim 2, we will assess
LC firing and gene expression alterations induced by NM, and how these changes in LC function trigger
behaviors relevant to prodromal and cognitive symptoms of AD. In Aim 3, we will manipulate various aspects
of NE synthesis/metabolism and tau to identify modifiers of NM accumulation and toxicity. Completion of
these aims will test, for the first time, causal relationships between NM and LC degeneration and function,
laying the foundation for novel therapies that prevent LC cell loss and behavioral and cognitive deficits in AD."

Fetal reversion is a novel regenerative phenomenon in which cells of the intestinal epithelium respond to damage
by downregulating the normal gene expression program observed during homeostasis and by acquiring a fetal-
like transcriptional state that promotes cell proliferation and intestinal repair. Fetal reversion has been observed
in different intestinal injury models in the mouse, including damage from parasitic or viral infection, radiation, and
chemical insults. It is unknown if fetal reversion is a universal property of intestinal healing or if it occurs only
during certain types of repair. Recent evidence indicates that this phenomenon may also occur in the human
intestine; however, this has also not been interrogated in a systematic way.
This project will create a unique large-scale research resource – an atlas of intestinal injury across multiple
species (mouse, human) and damage models that contains comprehensive single cell multiomic datasets of
regulatory and transcriptional dynamics during intestinal repair after injury. The atlas will be a tool for future
hypothesis generation for functional studies and will be an important community-wide resource available to the
entire scientific community. Genes and pathways essential for fetal reversion, and for any other common
intestinal regeneration programs, will be identified using atlas data. Functional studies to explore pathways and
genes will be conducted in mouse models through gain- and loss-of-function experiments and will be interrogated
in the human context using intestinal organoids as a model system. A high-throughput drug screening assay will
be used to identify compounds that induce fetal reversion, and top compounds identified will be assessed for
their ability to induce the fetal reversion state through transcriptomic and epigenomic assays, and to enhance
organoid-engraftment and injury repair in vivo through transplantation assays.
This project will create a multi-species injury-repair atlas and comprehensively characterize different modes of
intestinal regeneration, including fetal reversion, providing an unprecedented understanding of intestinal injury-
repair. All data, analyses, methods, models and screening protocols will be shared with the research community
for exploration and further analysis following established sharing models. The studies proposed here will identify
common and unique regenerative programs that are active in different injury contexts, creating a paradigm shift
in our understanding of gut repair, and laying the foundation for new fields of research and therapeutics."
10977802,"Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungus and the causative agent of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) that
develops in a wide spectrum of immunocompromised people. However, in healthy populations, C. albicans is a
commensal organism that is part of the oral microbiome. Salivary Histatin 5 (Hst 5) is a highly abundant salivary
protein that is well characterized for its fungicidal activity. Hst 5 contains six histidine residues that comprise two
zinc-binding motifs. Zinc (Zn) is the most abundant salivary metal, and Zn binding with Hst 5 causes
oligomerization of Hst 5 that alters it fungicidal activity. We found that treated C. albicans cells exposed to low
doses of Hst 5/Zn2+ recover as phenotypically different “survivor cells” that have altered cell wall composition,
increased adhesion and reduced invasion of oral epithelial cells (OECs) along with dampened OEC inflammatory
responses. Our hypothesis is that the major role of salivary Hst 5 when bound with zinc in vivo is to promote
commensalism of oral C. albicans thus maintaining this organism as member of the healthy oral microbiome.
We will test our hypothesis with following Specific Aims: 1. Determine whether cell wall changes in Hst5-Zn
induced survivor cells modify susceptibility to cell wall targeting antifungal drugs or alter binding with their
microbial mucosal binding partners. Aim 2. Determine how survivor cells modulate OECs inflammatory
responses and alter Candida colonization along with mucosal binding partners in vitro. Aim 3. Test
commensalism of survivor cells in vivo using a murine model of oral candidiasis by altering ambient oral zinc
levels. Our goal is to fully understand the how salivary Hst 5-Zn complexes might promote commensalism and
maintain a healthy homeostasis with mucosal oral binding partners, so that future clinical studies might be
directed to therapeutic oral rinses that alter zinc levels to improve the function of Hst 5."

Selective OX1 receptor antagonism by AZD4041 reduces the addiction-relevant behaviors in rodents and
primates relevant to those commonly found in opioid use disorder patients. Specifically, AZD4041 reduced the
motivation to consume opioids (or nicotine) and attenuated relapse-like drug seeking behaviors in laboratory
animals while avoiding OX2 receptor-associated effects that could limit its potential as a novel treatment for OUD
(e.g., sleep-promoting effects). AZD4041 did not have any non-specific behavioral effects in rodents or primates.
AZD4041 shows favorable drug-like safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles in rats and dogs. Based on these
findings, we initiated a Phase 1 single ascending dose safety study in healthy volunteers (HV) (IND144437). To
date in this trial, AZD4041 has shown a favorable PK and safety profile in human volunteers at exposures that
encompass those predicted to have efficacy in OUD patients. In this proposal, during the UG3 phase, we will
conduct the multiple ascending dose and respiratory safety assessments required to test the compound in OUD
patients. Contingent upon the successful completion of the UG3 milestones, which include favorable safety, PK
and respiratory depression profiles, we will advance to the UH3 phase, during which a proof of concept efficacy
study will be conducted in patients suffering from OUD. Successful completion of the UH3 phase will deliver a
selective OX1 receptor antagonist that is ready to advance to large-scale Phase 2 and 3 pivotal efficacy studies,
based upon which AstraZeneca will make this promising and highly beneficial therapeutic widely available to
OUD patients."

A growing body of research shows that ableist attitudes and beliefs are widespread among healthcare providers and
that many healthcare settings still lack necessary accommodations for patients with physical, psychiatric, sensory,
neurological, and learning disabilities. This medical ableism likely contributes to the substantial health disparities
experienced by people with disabilities. However, public health research to date has not evaluated the frequency and
variety of medical ableism experiences among patients with disabilities, nor has it measured how these experiences
adversely affect the care and health of disabled patients. The long-term goal of our research is to develop a nuanced and
comprehensive understanding of medical ableism that will ultimately allow us to develop targeted interventions to
mitigate its effects on the care and health of people with disabilities. The objective of this observational study is to
conduct quantitative analyses of the medical ableism phenomenon and its impact on the healthcare and health
outcomes of people with disabilities. This research will move the field beyond abstract assessments of internal ableism
among providers by providing detailed evidence about how people with disabilities experience medical ableism. The
specific aims of the project are: 1) to create and field survey modules measuring medical ableism and its adverse care
and health impacts, 2) to characterize experiences of medical ableism, and 3) to identify the adverse care and health
impacts of medical ableism. These aims will be met using a large, diverse, and well-established survey developed by the
research team: the National Survey on Disability and Health (NSHD). The 5th wave of the NSHD is currently open, and
the previous wave had a sample size of 2,725 adults with a variety of disabilities, providing sufficient statistical power for
subpopulation analyses.
The project research team and its expert advisory panel, comprised solely of researchers with disabilities, will model
best practices in disability inclusion and representation in disparities research. It will offer researchers and advocates a
new, publicly accessible, and user-friendly data source on critical dimensions of medical ableism. The large and diverse
survey sample will allow users to explore intersections between disability and race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation,
and socioeconomic status. The survey questions can be adopted or modified by advocates to assess discriminatory
practices and environments among local healthcare providers. The findings will also allow educators to develop and
refine disability curricula and target anti-ableist practices in medical education. The project further the National Center
on Medical Rehabilitation Research’s mission to foster the development of scientific knowledge needed to enhance the
health, productivity, independence, and quality of life of people with disabilities."

Ribosome production relies on a nuclear organelle called the nucleolus. Within this structure, ribosomal DNA
(rDNA) is transcribed to form RNA transcripts that associate with ribosomal proteins. Nucleolar architecture is
altered in many human diseases including numerous cancers, prompting several studies to search for
regulators of nucleolar morphology. While these studies rely on analysis of nucleolar proteins or ribosome
production to identify molecular regulators, few studies have defined cell cycle-specific mechanisms for
regulating nucleolar structure. Furthermore, no studies have examined the impact of rDNA spatial organization
on nucleolar morphology despite rDNA loci’s known role as Nucleolar Organizer Regions. The long-term goal
is to understand conserved regulatory mechanisms of rDNA and nucleolar organization. The overall objectives
of this proposal are to (i) to identify molecular regulators of rDNA spatial organization and (ii) define the
processes driving cell cycle-regulated nucleolar morphology. The central hypothesis is that the spatial
organization of rDNA is regulated, in part, by chromosome organizing proteins and ribosome biogenesis;
furthermore, these ribosome biogenesis processes are cell cycle-regulated, driving dynamic reorganization of
nucleolar morphology during interphase. The rationale for this study is that identification of conserved
molecular regulators of rDNA and nucleolar organization in fission yeast will provide a template for future
research in higher organisms. This central hypothesis will be tested by two specific aims: 1) identify molecular
regulators of rDNA spatial organization in fission yeast; and 2) define the processes driving cell cycle-regulated
nucleolar morphology. For aim 1, a novel tool for analysis of rDNA spatial organization in live cells has been
developed in fission yeast. This tool will be used to quantify rDNA spatial organization by fluorescence
microscopy in candidate mutants with altered chromosome organization and DNA topology factors. This
analysis will be expanded by a genome-wide high-throughput imaging screen to broadly identify regulators of
rDNA spatial organization. Aim 2 will apply fluorescence microscopy, cell biology, and molecular biology
approaches to examine the role of cell cycle-regulated ribosome biogenesis factors in interphase nucleolar
morphology. These studies examine rDNA and nucleolar morphology in fission yeast, a model system notable
for its application to higher organisms and ease of genetic manipulation. To understand the relationship
between nucleolar morphology and human disease, the regulatory mechanisms behind rDNA and nucleolar
organization must be identified. This study applies innovative imaging tools with advanced cellular and
molecular biology techniques to broadly identify fundamental molecular regulators of rDNA and nucleolar
morphology, providing a framework for future studies in human cells."

A critical gap in understanding the etiology of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) is identifying the upstream
factors that lead to the development of both Alzheimer’s pathology and related neural dysfunction. Vascular
disease is found in approximately 80% of patients with concomitant AD pathology and thus may be an
important contributor to the development of AD, however relationships between vascular health and the
emergence of AD pathophysiology has not yet been comprehensively investigated in cognitively normal
samples. While large vascular adverse events such as stroke are known to confer risk for developing vascular
dementia, growing evidence suggests that subtle vascular damage accrued through a lifetime of injury could
predispose neural structure and function to become more susceptible to AD-related pathophysiology. Critically,
chronic and subtle forms of vascular disease are more commonly found in Black and Hispanic populations with
reduced access to healthcare and could help explain the increased prevalence of AD in these populations.
The goal of this renewal project is to establish the role of cerebrovascular injury and dysfunction (CVID) in the
pathophysiology of preclinical AD and develop individualized imaging-based cerebrovascular profiles that
predict memory decline across racially and ethnically diverse populations. We will conduct follow-up
assessments in 100 nondemented older adults (over 60 years of age) in our current award (BEACoN Cohort:
R01AG053555), which includes amyloid-PET (florbetapir), serial high-resolution MRI and tau-PET (MK-6240),
our innovative digital cognitive biomarkers which assess pattern separation, and a full UDS-3
neuropsychological testing battery. We will complement this with targeted new recruitment (n = 100) to
increase the representation of Hispanic/Latino and Black participants in our cohort. We have built an
infrastructure to radically transform recruitment and retention in our study including innovative partnerships with
clinical research organizations with a demonstrable track record in minority recruitment. Given focus on subtle
vascular damage, we will exclude based on history of stroke or severe cardiovascular disease. Our aims are
(1) Assess the novel biomarker framework in which CVID predicts tau accumulation, which predicts structural
and functional deterioration of the medial temporal lobes (MTL), subsequently predicting decline in
hippocampal pattern separation. (2) Construct individualized brain imaging based CVID profiles that
differentially predict decline in hippocampal memory across racially and ethnically diverse populations. (3) Aim
3: Associate CVID profiles with modifiable lifestyle risk factors and structural and social determinants of health
that are differentially distributed across racial and ethnic groups. In summary, we will develop a novel
mechanistic framework for how CVID contributes to AD pathophysiology and memory/cognitive decline that
directly addresses racial and ethnic disparities in AD risk. Cerebrovascular profiles, and their associated
modifiable risk factors that confer the greatest risk of AD, will be identified as targets for future intervention."

 To reliably encode information about the environment, neurons must modify their activity profiles and even
connectivity to accurately interpret complex stimuli. Cortical feedback projections to the olfactory bulb are
uniquely positioned at the interface between detection-based processing that is driven by sensory input and
analytical processing occurring in the piriform cortex. This arrangement makes these projections an ideal target
to study how learning reshapes neuronal activity profiles. I have developed an approach that will allow for a
comprehensive analysis of the axonal activity of principal neurons in the piriform cortex, while mice learn a task
requiring them to identify a specific odor embedded in complex mixtures, thereby providing unique insight into
olfactory scene analysis. My approach will also provide a detailed analysis of the connectivity between cortical
axons and their postsynaptic targets in the olfactory bulb, which will reveal how the olfactory bulb integrates
processed information from the piriform cortex. The hypothesis I will test is that learning reshapes cortico-fugal
input to the olfactory bulb, leading to enhanced odor-scene segmentation through the disambiguation of
olfactory bulb output neuron activity profiles. The outcomes of these studies will provide novel insight into how
the brain updates its stimulus-encoding scheme from a synthetic to an analytical representation of a stimulus
environment. The studies proposed here are novel technically as well as conceptually, and the results will be
broadly applicable to other sensory systems. In Aim 1, I will characterize how learning shapes the activity of
cortical feedback projections to the olfactory bulb. Aim 2 will determine how the synaptic strength and number
of cortical inputs to individual olfactory modules are updated during learning. Finally, Aim 3 will determine how
cortical input shapes the activity profiles of bulbar output neurons. The training phase of this award was
conducted at Harvard University in the laboratories of Prof. Venkatesh Murthy and Prof. Naoshige Uchida. This
award will support a Diversity Fellow in my independent laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago to
provide her technical skills in the laboratory, academic preparation, and professional development necessary to
successfully apply to top graduate programs."

Over 69,000 women living with HIV, (WLWH) in Ghana have a six-fold increased risk of developing cervical
cancer1 and require early and frequent cervical cancer screening (CCS).2-4 However, available data in Ghana
show that the CCS rate among eligible women is as low as 2.7%, and there is no evidence that WLWH screen
at higher rates.5 In response to the need to increase the uptake of CCS among WLWH, our team developed a
Home-based self-sampling for cervical cancer Prevention Education (HOPE) intervention. HOPE consists of
HPV self-sampling combined with a 3R (Reframing, Reprioritizing, and Reforming) communication model for
promoting CCS. In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Ghana, we demonstrated that HOPE significantly
increased CCS among WLWH (100%) vs routine clinic-based screening (14.64%).8 Participating women found
the self-sampling and 3R communication model acceptable and culturally appropriate.8 High-impact
implementation strategies are needed to integrate and scale up HPV self-sampling into women’s healthcare in
Ghana. We propose to develop and/or adapt implementation strategies to maximize the success of the HOPE
intervention in increasing its health system adoption, patient uptake, and the sustainment of CCS among WLWH.
Our proposed hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation RCT trial will leverage existing relationships with
secondary-level health facilities in Ghana. We will select four secondary-level health facilities with comparable
infrastructure and WLWH patient enrollment. Using the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and
Sustainment (EPIS) framework,10,11 we will address the following specific aims.
Aim 1: To develop a culturally appropriate, evidence-based health system implementation plan and provider
training content for successful HOPE implementation (Preparation phase). Through nominal group techniques,
we will support engaged stakeholders in selecting, prioritizing, and adapting culturally appropriate
implementation support strategies (ISS) for HOPE. Aim 2: Assess the effectiveness of the HOPE 2.0 intervention
and success of the implementation plan in a hybrid type 2 trial (Implementation phase) We will conduct a hybrid
type 2 effectiveness-implementation RCT to evaluate the impact of implementation strategies. Four HIV
secondary-level clinics will be cluster-randomized 1:1 in a two-arm RCT. Healthcare providers in the intervention
group (IG, Arm 1) will receive evidence-based training validated in Aim 1. After training, trained providers will
recruit WLWH (n = 576) from their HIV facilities and implement HOPE. Providers in the control group (CG, Arm
2) who will not be trained with our ISS materials, will recruit WLWH (n = 576) and implement HOPE in their
clinics. Aim 3: Assess the impact of the implementation plan on the sustainment of the HOPE intervention at
study sites (Sustainment phase). We will assess the impact of HOPE on WLWH screening behaviors and the
impact of strategy material on providers' self-efficacy for implementing HOPE across the study arms."
11001396,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease in which neurons and microglia play causal and distinctive roles in its pathogenesis. These cellular mechanisms of AD need to be resolved at the level of individual brain cell types, especially at the protein (proteomic) level to best guide therapeutic and biomarker discovery. Our recent proteomic studies of human post-mortem brains have identified a signaling pathway called the MAPK/ERK pathway, as a strong predictor of AD pathology and cognitive decline. We have also found that activation of the ERK pathway is characteristic of activated microglia in a mouse model of AD pathology, and inhibition of ERK in microglia reduces their pro-inflammatory and detrimental responses. Based on these findings, our overall hypothesis is that excessive ERK activation is a central mechanism of AD pathogenesis that uniquely impacts the proteomic phenotypes of neurons and microglia, leading to neurodegeneration. In order to determine how MAPK/ERK signaling changes with aging and AD pathology in a mouse model, we will apply a novel in-vivo labeling approach called CIBOP-MS that enables us to define the dynamics of proteomic changes occurring specifically in microglia or neurons without the need for cell type isolation (Aim 1). Using a small molecule inhibitor of ERK activity, we will then determine how ERK inhibition impacts neuronal and microglial proteomes and identify novel biofluid biomarkers in an amyloid beta mouse model (Aim 2). Lastly, we will manipulate ERK activity leading to either over-activation or attenuation specifically in either neurons or microglia using genetic approaches (Aim 3). Collectively, our comprehensive studies focusing on ERK signaling in neurons and microglia, will validate CIBOP-MS as a novel approach to resolve brain cell type-specific proteome dynamics in aging and neurodegeneration, with biomarker and therapeutic implications. Our multidisciplinary expertise in in-vivo cell type specific proteomic labeling approaches, systems biology, neuroinflammation, biofluid biomarker discovery and mouse models of AD pathology uniquely positions us to execute this innovative R01 proposal."

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a leading cause of presenile dementia and is characterized by progressive
atrophy of the frontal and/or temporal lobes. There is no cure nor FDA-approved treatment to slow disease
progression. The most prevalent cause is a G4C2 repeat expansion located in the non-coding region of C9orf72,
leading to several pathologies including the formation of dipeptide repeat proteins. Arginine-containing
dipeptide repeat proteins, including poly(GR), are especially toxic. The most common form of FTD is
behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD), where marked changes in personality occur, including the loss of empathy,
considered one of the most distressing symptoms. Treatments aimed at alleviating the loss of empathy are
limited and the neural mechanisms underlying loss of empathy are poorly understood. Therefore, there is a
critical need to identify and develop therapeutic treatments to restore loss of empathy in bvFTD. The overall
goal is to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying this loss of empathy and to identify potential therapeutic
targets to restore empathy in bvFTD. The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) is a main site of FTD
pathogenesis and regulates empathy-driven consolation. We use a poly(GR) mouse model for bvFTD, where
poly(GR) accumulates in an age-dependent manner. Strikingly, mutant mice exhibit a complete loss of
consolation starting at 9-months of age, coinciding with middle-age. In mutant mice, we found that dmPFC
layer 5 pyramidal neurons become hypoexcitable during a transition into middle-age and that oxytocin can
restore empathy. In the F99 phase, I will establish oxytocin as a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of
lost empathy in bvFTD and delineate the detailed neural mechanisms and circuitry by which oxytocin restores
consolation using behavior, slice electrophysiology, and opto- and chemogenetic circuit manipulations to
establish that oxytocin in the dmPFC enables consolation and restores neurophysiology. I will learn advanced
patch-clamp electrophysiology skills and optogenetics before the transition to the K00 phase. The nervous
system undergoes numerous changes during aging. However, little is known about how the electrical
properties and associated molecular signatures of neurons change across the lifespan and in disease. There is a
crucial need to understand how alternations in these functions are disrupted in and contribute to disease. The
goal of the K00 phase is to identify age-dependent mechanisms contributing to lost empathy in bvFTD. I will
characterize age-dependent neuronal firing patterns and associated molecular signatures in wild-type and
bvFTD mice engaged in empathy behaviors and will restore impaired empathetic behavior by targeting
identified neurophysiological and molecular alternations. I will learn and use in vivo electrophysiology, single-
cell RNA-seq, and patch-seq. Completion of the F99 and K00 aims will fill critical gaps in our understanding of
the neural mechanisms of normal aging, dementia pathogenesis, and novel therapeutical development and will
provide training for me to become an academic investigator studying aging and age-related dementia."

 The susceptibility to Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is believed to be due in part to neuroinflammation
 and disease burden linked to neurodegeneration. It is well established that females have a more robust
 immune response than males however, neurodegeneration and disease progression are more sever in
 males. Thus, in the context of MS, this raises an intriguing question. Do females, by virtue of having a
 more robust inflammatory responses, have endogenous protection/repair mechanisms to protect the
 central nervous system (CNS) from inflammation induced pathology, that males do not have or that are
 not as effective in males? This proposal is based upon extensive preliminary and published data
 demonstrating that tmTNF/TNFR2 signaling in females, but not males, significantly improves motor
 function and reduces neuropathology in EAE by activating endogenous repair programs in neurons and
 oligodendrocytes. Based upon these and other results, our first experimental goal is to interrogate sex
 differences in tmTNF/TNFR2 induced improvements in motor function and neuropathology. Further, we
 have very novel pharmacological and genetic data that ligation of TNFR2 on both neurons and
 oligodendrocytes induce regenerative responses, through IRE1-dependent mechanisms. Based upon
 these and additional data our second experimental goal is to investigate the intersection between
 TNFR2/IRE1 signaling and to determine if the therapeutic effects of TNFR2 activation are dependent
 upon IRE1 activation. These goals will be tested in the following aims:
 Specific Aim 1: Investigate the sex-specific effects of tmTNF/TNFR2 signaling in the improvement of
 motor function and neuropathology.
A) We will investigate the role of sex hormones in tmTNF/TNFR2 signaling in the improvement of motor
 function and neuropathology in male and female mice.
B) We will investigate the role of sex chromosomes in tmTNF/TNFR2 signaling in the improvement of motor
 function and neuropathology in male and female mice.
 Specific Aim 2: Investigate TNFR2 induced endogenous repair mechanisms in male and female mice.
A) We will interrogate TNFR2 induced endogenous repair mechanisms oligodendrocytes and determine if
 they are required for motor recovery in females.
B) We will interrogate TNFR2 induced endogenous repair mechanisms neurons and determine if they are
 required for motor recovery in females, in vivo and in vitro."

 The goal of this R01 is to build upon our sponsored Positive Deviance research by identifying how
durably virally suppressed Black sexual minority men living with HIV (BSMM LWH) overcome racism and
intersectional stigma on multiple socioecological levels. Only 62% of the 58% of BSMM LWH who adhere to
treatment are virally suppressed and HIV care disparities have persisted for the past 15 years. Our preliminary
studies suggest that the small proportion of virally suppressed BSMM LWH are “positive deviants” who
consciously or unconsciously maintain their health despite adversity and could offer researchers effective
solutions for the community. Identifying how exemplar men with successful HIV care outcomes overcome or
withstand racism and intersectional stigma in high barrier contexts is significant and novel for intervention
design because it shifts the HIV care research paradigm towards community-driven, strengths-based solutions.
Therefore, the goal of this R01 is to identify novel strategies and multilevel facilitators that help BSMM LWH
sustain durable viral suppression. Guided by Positive Deviance, this study will identify how BSMM LWH
navigate racism and stigma to retain in care, adhere to treatment, and sustain viral suppression in two
understudied, high-barrier contexts: Shelby County, TN and Prince George’s County, MD. Studying positive
deviants in Shelby and Prince George’s Counties is significant because they are two of the largest majority-
Black counties in the U.S. with well-documented inequities that could provide unidentified solutions for others
who experience substantial barriers. We will begin by building upon our preliminary data using in-depth 60
qualitative interviews (Aim 1), then conduct ethnographic go-alongs to identify unconscious facilitators in their
neighborhood and clinical contexts (Aim 2). Specifically, we will interview them in their neighborhoods and
audio-record their follow-up HIV care visits to study how they overcome communication challenges with
clinicians. Findings will be combined with publicly available data about neighborhood characteristics and clinic
policies to design novel multi-dimensional figures called glyphs on county-wide maps. Glyphs will help us
visualize and identify the key components needed in an intervention to support other BSMM LWH (Aim 3).
Using Positive Deviance in HIV care research to identify existing community strengths for intervention design is
highly significant and novel. This study aligns with NIH priorities to understand multilevel factors and design
novel interventions to improve HIV care outcomes and is the next step needed in our work to support BSMM
LWH. This study uses an innovative and significant strengths-based framework to discover, evaluate, and
subsequently diffuse effective interventions for HIV outcomes, leading to high public health impact. Findings
will allow us to design, refine, and implement at least one intervention in a subsequent R34 proposal that
already exists in real-world contexts but remains unknown to researchers."

Our long-term goal is to understand post-transcriptional mechanisms that spatially and temporally control gene
activity during animal development. We focus on intracellular mRNA localization, translational control, and
degradation, which play crucial roles in regulating production of proteins from maternally supplied transcripts.
These transcripts, which underpin the initial developmental program of nearly all animals, are pre-loaded in the
egg. Thus, control over where and when they are deployed to produce protein must be exerted post-
transcriptionally. Our research capitalizes on the highly manipulable Drosophila model, which relies heavily on
maternal transcripts, to investigate mechanisms that generate asymmetric maternal mRNA and protein
distributions needed for embryonic body patterning and germline development. Our previous work revealed that
numerous mRNAs accumulate at the posterior of the Drosophila oocyte through their incorporation into large,
non-membrane-bound ribonucleoprotein (RNP) assemblies called germ granules. During embryogenesis, germ
granules deliver this cohort of mRNAs to the primordial germ cells, where they support germline development.
Germ granules are a hallmark of primordial germ cells throughout the animal kingdom. They contain conserved
components that indicate a common function in RNA regulation to promote the differentiation, proliferation, and
maintenance of the germline. Germ granules are just one of a plethora of cellular RNP assemblies that have
been characterized for their phase-transitioned behavior. How mRNA regulation occurs in the context of RNA
granules more generally and its biological significance remain, however, poorly understood. As complex and
biologically relevant RNP assemblies, germ granules are ideal for studying RNA localization, translational
control, and degradation and, in particular, their biological significance. Our studies lead to a model for germ
granule ""client"" RNA accumulation by self-recruitment and organization into homotypic clusters. This model
provides a framework to investigate how mRNAs self-organize in granules and how this organization imparts
selective control over the translation and stability of different mRNAs within shared granules. We will combine
quantitative high resolution imaging with powerful biochemical and genetic/genomic strategies, as well as novel
methods that disrupt granules, to investigate fundamental principles governing the organization of granule client
RNAs. These studies will enable us to decipher the relationship between granule association, translational
activity, and germ granule function. Given the widespread use of post-transcriptional mechanisms during
development, and the prevalence of RNA compartmentalization in granules, this work will have broad impact.
Mechanistic insights gained from our studies will also provide a foundation for understanding defects in RNA
metabolism associated with numerous disorders including infertility, cancer, and neurodegeneration."

enhanced fundamental program activities, we will collect, analyze and report data for all
currently-defined occupational health indicators (OHI) by the Council of State and Territorial
Epidemiologists, conduct detailed analysis of OHIs and other state and national datasets. We
will also conduct in-depth investigation and case follow-up activities for adult blood lead

acute occupational pesticide poisoning (AOPP) surveillance and prevention, 2) occupational
respiratory disease (ORD) surveillance and prevention and 3) enhancing state’s occupational
health informatics for emergency preparedness and response. We will continue collaborative-
enhancing activities with state and federal partners to conduct interventions for prevention of

There is an acute need to address rising mental health concerns among both older and young
adults, as seen by recent increases in depression, anxiety, social isolation, and psychiatric
crises. However, many barriers currently exist to the provision of comprehensive, holistic, and
person-centered care to meet these needs. Behavioral health provider shortages, high costs for
mental health care, lack of sufficient insurance coverage of services, and stigma associated with
mental health diagnoses or medication are a few of these challenges. Integrated care delivery
methods that account for the social aspects of health and leverage community resources to help
meet people where they are, such as social prescribing, can help address barriers and improve
access to needed care. Social prescribing models are prominent in other countries with public
healthcare systems, and they are growing in popularity in the US as a method for addressing
health disparities and providing community-centered care. Additionally, there is a large body of
evidence that points to the benefits of engagement with arts, art therapy, and cultural
enrichment activities for mental health and social connection, both of which have implications for
the cost and treatment of physical health conditions. Art Pharmacy is transforming mental health
care treatment engagement by harnessing the power of arts and culture for enhancing health
and integrating this into the US healthcare system. We are an arts-based social prescribing
company that provides personalized arts prescriptions to help patients at risk of or experiencing
mental health or social isolation concerns, while addressing the stigma of mental health
treatment and helping fill the gap in behavioral health service shortages. Our smart matching
technology enables us to tailor recommendations for arts and culture engagements based on
patient characteristics, health goals and conditions, and artistic tastes to maximize the health
benefits of arts engagement and prevent deterioration of health. In this way, we are creating and
supplying a “precision medicine” approach for mental health care that centers an individual’s
preferences and helps support social connection to promote health and well-being. This grant
application will support the further development of our smart matching technology by leveraging
machine learning to create an artificial intelligence-based recommendation engine that will
enable us to scale our approach across the nation and provide arts and culture-based social
prescriptions to everyone who needs them."

This application requests partial funding for the 2024 Pittsburgh International Lung Conference (PILC) “From
Smog to Social Equity: How the Exposome Shapes Our Respiratory Health.” The exposome is defined as
“The cumulative measure of environmental influences and associated biological responses throughout the
lifespan, including environmental exposures, diet, behavior, and endogenous processes.” Therefore, studying
the exposome requires collaboration among diverse fields such as environmental epidemiology, toxicology, and
basic science and represents both a timely and suitable topic for a multi-disciplinary conference on lung disease.
PILC 2024 will provide a platform for investigators from various disciplines related to the exposome to share
ideas, showcase technological innovations, and build collaborations. The conference program includes a
Keynote Presentation followed by six main sessions over two days focusing on indoor and outdoor air pollution,
the microbiome and the environment, smoking and e-cigarettes, climate change, basic to clinical translation, and
social determinants of health. Interspaced with these sessions are two panel discussions, including one focused
on career coaching for early career investigators, poster sessions, and a formal dinner with a presentation. The
conference organizers will facilitate interaction between participants, thought leaders, early career faculty, and
community providers throughout the conference. Speakers will include medical professionals (MDs, PhDs, and
RNs) from leading academic institutions. A plan to promote diversity, wellness, and a safe environment at the
conference is included. To our knowledge, no scientific conference of this kind has been organized in recent
years.
 We propose the following aims: (1) To provide an inclusive, safe, and collaborative environment for
researchers to disseminate and discuss scientific advances in our understanding of the exposome as it relates
to pulmonary medicine. We aim to organize a meeting from September 19-20th, 2024, in Pittsburgh, PA, to
attract the top scientists in the field, early career faculty, trainees, and community providers, including women
and minorities. Interaction will be facilitated via panel discussions, question and answer sessions, dinner talks,
shared meals, and poster sessions. (2) To promote the interaction of students, clinical trainees, post-doctoral
trainees, and early career faculty with established investigators. Travel awards will be targeted toward trainees
and early career faculty. Essentially, all participants will be able to present a poster. Each of the six sessions will
feature a presentation from early career faculty (pre-K level). A panel discussion will be held where chiefs from
several pulmonary divisions will provide career coaching to trainees and early career faculty."

Saccharibacteria (also known as TM7) are ubiquitous members of the human oral microbiome whose relative
abundance increases dramatically during mucosal inflammation (gingivitis and periodontitis), yet their biology
and role in microbial ecology and pathogenesis have remained largely elusive. During the previous funding
cycles, we successfully isolated TM7x, the first member of the uncultivated TM7 phylum from humans. we
demonstrated that TM7x has ultrasmall cell size with a highly reduced genome, and it displays an obligate
episymbiotic lifestyle where TM7x lives on the surface of its bacterial host Schaalia odontolytica XH001. Our
studies have provided critical insights into the unique biology of these ultrasmall bacteria and their impact on
the physiology and pathogenesis of host bacteria. The knowledge gained in our prior work not only allows a
better understanding of the TM7 phylum, but also sheds light on the general biology of Candidate Phyla
Radiation (CPR) organisms among which episymbiosis is predicted to be a preferred lifestyle. Nevertheless,
due to the lack of effective genetic tools, the genetic determinants that govern TM7x and XH001 interaction
and the molecular underpinnings of episymbiosis remain largely unexplored.
In this ongoing project, we have found that TM7x/XH001 episymbiosis is a dynamic, reciprocal, multi-stage
process that spans four main phases: initial binding, host killing, recovery and stable symbiosis. These
biological processes are highly relevant to their prevalence and persistence in the human oral cavity. Our
analyses suggest the presence of two forms of type IV pili (T4P) in TM7x which may carry out diverse
functions. Specifically, in the initial binding phase, the recognition and binding, a critical step in establishing
episymbiosis, is mediated through TM7x-encoded T4P and can be inhibited by exogenously added sugars,
similar to a key cell surface carbohydrate component in the host bacterium XH001. Importantly, a recent
significant breakthrough in TM7x genetics now enables significant advancements. Thus
, the overall goal of the
proposed study is to build upon intriguing new findings within the distinct phases during episymbiosis and
leverage newly developed molecular tools to achieve a mechanistic level understanding of the detailed
molecular processes required for bacterial episymbiosis in the human microbiome.
The proposal comprises two parts. Part I is designed for focused investigation on the critical roles of multiple
TM7x-encoded T4P in its symbiotic lifestyle; while Part II seeks to identify and validate the key molecular
components in TM7x and its host governing the dynamic symbiotic process.
The successful completion of
these aims will provide a fundamental mechanistic understanding of the episymbiotic interaction between TM7
and their hosts, setting a solid foundation with key enabling toolsets and molecular level information to
ultimately understand their observed in vivo persistence in disease, impact on the pathogenesis of oral bacteria
and potential to modulate the microbial ecology within the human microbiome."

Malaria is currently rising and continues to pose a significant public health threat, with 249 million cases and
608,000 deaths annually, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa. The disease disproportionally affects children under
five years residing in holoendemic Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) transmission regions, who account for 94% of
the cases and 78% of the mortality. Young children, such as our study participants in Siaya, Kenya, are highly
vulnerable to developing life-threatening severe malarial anemia [SMA, hemoglobin (Hb)<5.0 g/dL]. To address
this challenge, we have conducted molecular-based clinical research for 23 years in our state-of-the-art facilities
in this high-transmission area. Despite concerted national malaria control efforts, transmission intensity in Siaya
has remained constant over the last decade. During the NIAID-funded R01 (2018-2022; current NCE), we
investigated the impact of immune response genes on the development of SMA in acute disease (day 0-14:
n=820). Findings from these studies provide valuable insights into the relationship between malaria immunity
and short-term recovery. In addition, we recently completed a longitudinal birth cohort study (0-36 months,
n=750) in children who did not receive a malaria vaccine. This study can be leveraged to discover molecular
profiles linked to long-term immunity against malaria in the absence of vaccination. The recent rollout of the 1st
approved malaria vaccine, RTS,S/AS01, in Siaya offers promise for malaria control. However, the vaccine has
limited efficacy, particularly in high transmission settings, and the mechanisms of protection are largely unknown.
For the renewal activities, we propose the recruitment of a birth cohort (0-36 mos.: n=750) that will receive
RTS,S/AS01 using identical recruitment and follow-up. This strategy creates a unique opportunity to examine
temporal molecular profiles in clinical phenotypes pre- and post-vaccination. The overall goal is to identify
essential molecular networks that impact clinical outcomes throughout the crucial phases of naturally acquired
immunity. We will employ mRNAseq to capture the entire expressed human transcriptome and Pf gene
expression (concomitantly in whole blood), along with aptamer-based technologies to catalog the human
proteome (plasma), collectively defining the Malarial Immunity Omics Landscape (MIOL). Temporal measures
of high-dimensional multi-omics data will be analyzed with innovative modeling approaches that integrate
bioinformatics, statistical analyses, and machine learning to achieve the following aims: (1) Determine how
changes in the MIOL influence malarial severity throughout the development of naturally acquired immunity
(unvaccinated children), (2) Determine the impact of vaccination on the MIOL to identify molecular profiles
associated with protection, breakthrough infections, and disease severity, and (3) Identify molecular networks in
the MIOL that can be therapeutically targeted to reduce malaria disease severity in future trials. Successful
execution of the proposed activities can have important and rapid translational effects for the creation of more
effective malaria vaccines and therapeutic approaches to improve patient outcomes."

This application requests support for a novel 1-year dissemination and implementation conference grant in which
the University of Chicago Comprehensive Care Physician (CCP) Program research team will engage 65-75
health care leaders, clinicians, social service providers, and patients through an in-person 1.5-day conference
in Chicago and monthly virtual sessions for the duration of the project period. Building on our successful AHRQ-
supported inaugural Comprehensive Care Conference in 2023, the conference will focus on sharing
dissemination tools and implementation frameworks for evidence-based care delivery models that increase
relational continuity across inpatient and outpatient settings for patients at increased risk of hospitalization and
address complex medical and social needs. This focus is motivated by evidence that greater continuity of care
can improve outcomes for patients at increased risk of hospitalization. This evidence includes studies of our CCP
Program that find that providing patients at increased risk of hospitalization access to care from the same doctor
in and out of the hospital can reduce hospitalization and improve health outcomes. As a result of these positive
findings, interest in implementing similar comprehensive care models has grown, with several community and
academic medical centers across the U.S. and internationally adapting CCP in their settings with our guidance.
This proposal builds on several years of successfully facilitating relevant learning collaboratives that have
engaged a diverse set of health care providers and health system types through virtual meetings in the context
of COVID-19, including a recent Comprehensive Care Grand Rounds virtual meeting series. Participants in those
meetings have expressed significant interest in building a community around “comprehensive care” with in-
person convening opportunities to share implementation best practices and evaluation methods.
We propose 3 specific aims for this conference grant:
Aim 1: To prepare for the conference by ongoing convening activities to develop new implementation tools, and
to support implementation mentorship and related implementation science professional development
opportunities.
Aim 2: To hold a conference in late 2024 that builds on the 2023 Comprehensive Care Conference and includes
presentations and workshops that focus on implementation and evaluation of comprehensive care models
including: 1) application of implementation science frameworks to implementing care models, 2) implementation
strategies focused on hybrid models to bridge to full CCP models, and 3) evaluation strategies that jointly analyze
implementation and intervention effectiveness.
Aim 3: To plan for future conferences that focus on dissemination and implementation of CCP/C4P in diverse
environments, including urban and rural community hospitals and academic medical centers."

The etiology and effects of musicality, broadly defined as the set of fundamental human
capacities to interact with music, have mainly been studied via brain and behavioral methods
and primarily at small scale, until very recently. We formally established the Musicality
Genomics Consortium (MusicGens) in 2022 as an international network of researchers
dedicated to the advancement of research on the genomics of human musicality traits via multi-
site, cross-disciplinary collaboration. The purpose of MusicGens is to enable scientific
discoveries related to the genetics, genomics and phenomics of musicality, by fostering
research directions of a large magnitude that would not be possible for any single research
group to pursue alone. The overarching objective of this grant is to provide a stable forum to
nurture a robust and rigorous science of musicality genetics via conference support for the
annual meeting of MusicGens. The conference funding will support the educational and
research missions of the annual meeting, with specific resources dedicated to expanding
participation to a more diverse range of individuals and to developing strategies for augmenting
musicality genomics research in populations underrepresented in biomedical research. The
conference support has the potential for impact in the arena of multiple basic science and
translational manifestations of how and why musicality unfolds over the lifespan, with
particularly innovative potential for precision health."
11007395,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) can be managed with anti-retroviral therapies (ART), but a cure
remains elusive. This is due to a reservoir of latently infected cells, which are established early in infection.
Elimination of these reservoirs is crucial for curing HIV. Several strategies to deplete the viral reservoirs are
under investigation, such as the shock and kill strategy, which stimulates latently infected cells into active viral
production using a latency reversal agent (LRA). This strategy allows cytotoxic lymphocytes, such as such as
CD8T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, to kill HIV infected cells, to kill HIV-infected cells. Unfortunately, these
cytotoxic cells are insufficient to clear the infection due to immune exhaustion as a result of chronic inflammation.
As a result, current research is focusing on determining molecules and signaling pathways that can boost the
cytotoxicity of effector lymphocytes.
 NK cells have been shown to be important in the control of SIV and HIV infection. However, chronic HIV-
1 infection leads to pathologic changes in NK cells, including defective functionality, and control of viremia with
antiretrovirals has been reported to restore some but not all NK cells activity. Interleukin-15 (IL15) is a critical
cytokine that trigger the Janus Kinase (JAK)/ signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway
signaling cascade, which plays a vital role in NK cell function. IL15 is particularly important for NK cell
development, differentiation, maturation, cytotoxicity, cytokine production, proliferation, and survival.
Nonreceptor tyrosine phosphatases (NTPs) protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 1 (PTPN1) and type
2 (PTPN2) can downregulate STAT signaling pathway by dephosphorylating JAKs, STATs, and other proteins
through their catalytic domain. Previous studies in the lab have shown that targeting PTPN1 and PTPN2 with
the small molecule 3-Hydroxy-1,2,3-benzotriazin-4(3H)-one (HODHBt), enhances the effector function of CD8+
T and NK cells. In Aim 1, I will assess the role of both phosphatases controlling the activation and expression of
cytotoxic proteins in NK cells by using a newly identified double inhibitor ABBV-CLS-484 (Osunprotafib or AC-
484) and by generating CRISPR-knockouts of PTPN1 and/or PTPN2. Using a primary HIV-infected CD4 T cell
model, I will test the cytolytic activity of autologous NK cells either treated with AC-484 or CRISPR-knockouts
against a viral HIV-1 panel including subtype A, B, C, and D. In Aim 2, I will use NSG-Tg (IL15) mice to evaluate
HIV control in vivo. By understanding the critical importance of PTPN1 and PTPN2 phosphatases in NK cell
cytolytic function, we can better develop more effective cure strategies against HIV. Completion of the proposed
project will also help me to develop the necessary research and professional skills that are essential for my
career as an HIV investigator."
11007396,"Summary
PD-(L)1 checkpoint inhibitors are an effective class of oncology therapeutics, where some
patients with non-small cell lung, bladder cancer and melanoma demonstrate durable responses
and significant increases in overall survival. This form of therapy, however, is accompanied by
several significant disadvantages including; unpredictable and low activity (15-20% response-
rates) for most patients, high therapy cost ($150,000 per year) and serious immune-related
adverse events that often result in hospitalization or stoppage of therapy. There have been a
variety of approaches attempting to accurately predict response to PD-(L)1 immunotherapy such
as PD-L1 immunohistochemistry staining, tissue or liquid-biopsy based genomic signatures such
as TMB (tumor mutational burden), and multiplex immunohistochemistry / immunofluorescence.
None of these approaches have yielded results that materially improve patient selection. Onc.AI
is developing the first universal radiomics-based multi-modal biomarker solution to predict
response to PD-(L)1 immunotherapy. By leveraging novel imaging biomarkers in combination
with proteomic, genomic and clinical features, all tumors comprising a patient’s tumor burden can
be interrogated through the application of advanced Machine Learning and computer vision
techniques on CT scans alongside routine lab tests and patient characteristics. This approach
avoids the shortcomings of tissue or blood-based biomarkers, which are not able to accurately
capture and account for variable intra/inter tumor heterogeneity, diversity and immunogenicity
that characterizes metastatic cancer. Achieving accurate prediction of PD-(L)1 ICI therapy
response will enable a host of high-impact clinical applications such as -- identification of hyper-
progressing patients (patients where tumor growth accelerates as a result of PD-(L)1 ICI);
improved selection of patients (predicted non-responders) who would benefit from chemotherapy
or additional immunotherapy added to a PD-(L)1 ICI backbone; appropriately de-escalating
combination therapy to minimize toxicity for predicted responders (switching patient from PD-
(L)1/chemo to PD-(L)1 monotherapy); and informing continuation of PD-(L)1 therapy at the 12 to
24 month mark based on radiomic signatures more advanced than tumor shrinkage. Each of
these applications has the potential to either significantly improve patient outcomes and/or
optimize the health-economic profile of PD-(L)1 treatment.
Onc.AI’s proposal has three specific aims:
Aim 1: Validate predictive models in a multi-institutional prospective clinical study.
We will validate the efficacy of radiomics-based multi-modal models in predicting response to
PD-1/PD-L1 ICI therapy in EGFR/ALK mutation-negative stage IV NSCLC patients and in
adjudicating concurrent chemotherapy.
Aim 2: Evaluate key performance characteristics and biological basis of radiomics-based
predictive models.
We will evaluate our production candidate models on secondary outcome measures (duration of
response, progression-free survival, time-to-progression, overall survival) and investigate
associations with key imaging, demographic, and molecular pathways, using prospectively
collected harmonized data from Aim 1.
Aim 3: Enhance existing models and develop new models to support new clinical use
cases. Independently from the models validated in Aim 1, we will evaluate feasibility of
incorporating tumor mutation burden (TMB) into our predictive model using prospectively
collected data and investigate a novel modeling approach and clinical use case - early response
assessment using serial imaging and delta radiomics."

Banff Lesion Scores are utilized globally for assessing the condition of allografts, particularly donor kidneys.
They are also used to predict the overall health of the transplanted organ. However, visual human assessment,
coupled with imprecise definitions, leads to inter-observer and intra-observer variability. This subjectivity in
evaluation often results in conservative decisions, causing potentially viable donor organs to be discarded,
representing missed opportunities. Furthermore, detailed visual assessment by pathologists is time consuming,
and its monotony can lead to increased errors and worker burnout. Increasing automation of this analysis will
alleviate both of these challenges.
 Our project, BANFF-AID, Banff Automated Nephrology Feature Framework - Artificial Intelligence
Diagnosis, aims to transform and significantly improve this process by introducing artificial intelligence
(AI)-driven automated score generation and a user-centric web-based workflow for kidney biopsies. Through
the integration of custom-built AI models that extract essential features from biopsy slides, our system delivers
accurate and continuous (non-discretized) Banff Lesion Scores. Our approach of using AI-produced image
segmentation of features of interest ensures that the results are explainable and the method is transparent.
This approach also empowers pathologists to intervene and make corrections to the segmentation in case of
incorrect scoring due to inaccurate feature segmentation. Our software framework builds upon previous efforts
supported by various NIH grants, providing a strong foundation.
 In Phase I, our proof of concept development will focus on renal tissues featuring arteriosclerosis,
glomerulosclerosis, and IFTA (interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy). We will be working with H&E
(hematoxylin and eosin) stained frozen sections using more precise definitions than those employed in routine
histopathology practice. Moving into Phase II, our goal is to expand the scope to compute multiple Banff Lesion
Scores from multiple slides and multiple stains. This comprehensive approach will reduce the burden on the
pathologists, allowing them to focus on interpreting measurements and providing diagnosis.

11006098,"ABSTRACT
Fibroproliferative illnesses leading to organ fibrosis and failure are responsible for approximately 45% of deaths
in developed countries. Whether idiopathic, triggered by environmental factors, infections, or genetics, organ
fibrosis results in significant morbidity and mortality. Organ fibrosis is responsible for health care costs exceeding
$10 billion/year. It is estimated that the number of deaths due to fibrosis is double the number of deaths due to
cancer, and that organ fibrosis results in significant physical, emotional, and financial burdens. Specifically, lung
fibrosis can be idiopathic, associated with connective tissue diseases such as systemic sclerosis (SSc), or
triggered by environmental and occupational exposures such as radiotherapy. Lung involvement is currently the
leading cause of death of patients with SSc. There are currently no effective therapies to treat existing lung
fibrosis as recently approved drugs merely reduce disease progression and result in significant side effects.
Thus, the only curative option for patients is organ transplantation, which is impossible at the scale needed. We
have identified a peptide derived from collagen XVIII which exerts anti-fibrotic effects in murine and human pre-
clinical models of lung fibrosis. The beneficial effects include reducing fibrosis in lung tissues of patients with
pulmonary fibrosis who underwent lung transplantation and thus have end-stage severe fibrosis, an effect not
seen with other drugs that are approved or being evaluated for these illnesses. We propose to assess the
therapeutic potential of the peptide in vivo in a murine model of lung fibrosis. We also propose to identify the
minimal effective dose and optimal dosing frequency and conduct pilot toxicity, pharmacokinetic, and
biodistribution analyses. Successful completion of this project will support our long-term goal of translating our
findings to the clinic and providing patients with pulmonary fibrosis with an effective therapy. Identifying a peptide
effective at reducing fibrosis represents a critical unmet need. Our approach is also likely to have broad impact
and relevance for fibrosis in different organs."
11005426,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The use of DNA-encoded library (DEL) technology for the identification of therapeutic molecules to
treat opioid use disorders (OUDs).
This Phase I SBIR project aims at the identification, using a novel DEL drug discovery platform, of small
molecular weight compounds that can bind to the receptor GPR26 belonging to the family of G-protein coupled
receptors (GPCRs) with the goal of restoring brain functions associated with the reward system without
affecting opioid receptors. Effects of opioids are mediated through GPCR μ-opioid receptors (MORs) and
indirectly through dopaminergic pathways via dopamine receptors. Some of these pathways, and the basal
ganglia signaling in general, were largely deciphered by us in the Greengard lab over the last three decades.
Morphine perturbs the mesolimbic dopaminergic system which is triggered in conditions of dependence and
withdrawal. Furthermore, morphine-dependency is associated with elevated cAMP levels, altering broad cAMP
signaling, in the striatum especially. GPCRs represent one of the most important therapeutic classes and many
of them remain largely understudied and without a known ligand (called orphan GPCRs or oGPCRs). We have
identified several oGPCRs strongly and selectively expressed in brain regions highly relevant for substance
use disorders (SUDs). Those represent a remarkable and unexploited opportunity to counteract OUDs in an
innovative way, and without targeting the opioid receptors directly. We are proposing to focus this program on
GPR26 that appears to be the strongest candidate, based on our knowledge and preliminary data, to modify
cAMP signaling and potentially rebalance the basal ganglia signaling. GPCRs drug discovery is hampered by
the need of large amounts of mostly non-physiological receptor protein (E. coli) for high-throughput screening
(HTS) and the need for a clear biological activity to perform HTS drug screening. Our research strategy is to
identify GPR26 binders addressing each of these limitations by using a DNA-encoded library (DEL) screening
approach that will allow small amounts of a physiological/high quality target to be used with very large
screening power (125 million entirely new and proprietary compounds) and a binding-based assay that is
activity-independent. The central hypothesis is that due to the very large number of compounds available to be
tested and the inherent diversity, it will be possible to identify efficiently, in a cost-effective way, compounds
that are high-affinity binders (pre-optimization) of GPR26. DEL screening protocols have been generated and
optimized focusing on minimizing the amount of protein to be used and on purifying protein targets from
mammalian cells. These steps will ensure that a physiological GPR26 version is used for screening purposes
and that screen duplicates will increase confidence and improve hits’ heuristic values determination. Aim 1 will
be dedicated to DEL screening campaigns and 125 millions of DEL compounds will be tested using purified
GPR26 or GPR26 containing membranes as target source. GPR26 will be expressed in mammalian cells,
purified, and immobilized. This will allow synthesis and validation steps proposed in Aim 2. Aim 1 will generate
a list of 100 preferred hits and we will help prioritize them for further validations. Aim 2 will include chemical
synthesis of on-DNA compounds and 18 hits off-DNA. All hits will be validated first for physical binding using
two different methods and activity will be evaluated in mammalian cells. This Program will identify and validate
compounds with 3-digit nanomolar range KD or lower and demonstrating receptor activity. This will represent a
strong proof of concept fully validating Phase I and a strong starting point to initiate Phase II with 3-5
compounds."

Following a highly successful Phase I, we will integrate closed-loop optogenetic capabilities into our fully
implantable, wireless, battery-free, Mechano-Acoustic (MA) device. Additional antenna booster coil designs will
increase cage power to the devices and allow larger open-field enclosures to be utilized. The MA device acquires
multi-parameter physiological data from freely moving small animal models, via use of a high bandwidth triaxial
accelerometer and temperature sensor to record vital sign information such as the heart and respiration rate and
body temperature, and other general features about the animal that include locomotion and body orientation.
Each of these features are determined in parallel from subtle motions detected with this platform using the most
advanced inertial measurement unit (IMU) technology and transmitted wirelessly and analyzed in real-time using
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 5.2 to an external reader system – all isolated to individual subjects within
experimental contexts spanning single to multi-animal behaviors. This approach allows other experimental
approaches (video tracking, neural recording, etc.) to be directly coupled to the recorded physiological data. By
delivering both power and data wirelessly, and by entirely eliminating all external fixtures and physical tethers
on the animal, the proposed technology enables chronic physiological recordings in three-dimensional
naturalistic environments, from isolated individuals or social groups, in ways that are fundamentally impossible
with conventional hardware infrastructure. This low-cost manufacturable system is fully compatible with the
NeuroLux radio frequency wireless electronic platform and control software, allowing us to leverage the strengths
of an existing commercial platform currently in use worldwide to further advance behavioral and physiological
research capabilities."
10978169,"The Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board (NPAIHB) is proposing a partnership of Northwest tribes and tribal organizations to develop a Northwest Regional Research Center (NW RRC) to enhance tribal data science and ensure tribal data sovereignty. NPAIHB will utilize the Northwest Tribal Prevention System (NW TPS) as an opportunity to provide targeted in real-time training for tribal members who are working as community-based researchers on this project. A central aspect of the NW TPS is to develop a workforce of tribal members in becoming community-based researchers. Additionally, building data infrastructure for the tribes to access data in real time will enhance data sovereignty. NPAIHB will work with 5 tribes to identify key tribal site staff who will be responsible for developing the data protocol for the NW TPS and develop individualized training plans of tribes to lead this work. This project meets the NCREW goal of conducting community-led research, while improving data and increasing research capacity of tribes while enhancing culturally grounded, strengths-based, effective, and sustainable intervention strategies; and the Helping to End Addiction Long-term Initiative (HEAL) goal of working closely with communities to implement programs for prevention, harm reduction, and recovery. 
 
In August 2023, NPAIHB hosted the National Tribal Opioid Summit (NTOS.) This event provided opportunities for tribal, federal, regional, and state leaders to discuss the opioid crisis through 4 focused tracks: data, care and support, prevention, and law and justice. The data priorities spoke to data classification, tribal data sovereignty, data sharing, technical assistance, and support. Additionally, NTOS recommendations include funding; providing research in prevention efforts; and evaluating the impact of culture into prevention and treatment efforts. In response, NPAIHB has proposed the development of the NW RRC and the development and implementation of the NW TPS project. 
 
NW TPS is a primary prevention initiative begun in conjunction with the WA HCA and 5 tribes in Washington state. The NW TPS project aim is to build upon tribal strengths to create a primary prevention model that will align efforts between tribal government and health, social service, justice, and education systems, internally and with municipal, county, state, and federal partners. The NW TPS is data driven through a youth survey that is undertaken and analyzed to gauge efficacy of prevention programs in real time. The NCREW two-year project will support the development of the training and infrastructure for the pilot project and will inform the expansion of the NW TPS project throughout the Pacific Northwest. 
 
NPAIHB will act as the data hub for the tribal youth surveys, providing consultation, development and adaptation of the of the Washington youth survey; identifying or developing additional project surveys; ensuring that culture is incorporated into surveys; and providing research training to tribal staff working on the initiative. Through the NCREW application, NPAIHB will provide targeted training, technical assistance and support to achieve the development of a community-based research infrastructure specific to each tribe. The overall goal is to simultaneously establish continuity across the projects to ensure the success of the NW TPS, while also meeting the specific needs of each of the tribes.
This study is part of the NIH’s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions for the overdose epidemic, including opioid and stimulant use disorders, and the crisis of chronic pain. The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction and acute and chronic pain."

The human pangenome encompasses global genetic diversity missing from any single reference genome. This
project will develop sequence alignment, population genetic, and visualization tools that enable new ways to
access and understand the pangenome. These innovations aim to catalyze discoveries by making expansive
pangenome resources more intuitive for diverse genomics communities. We will create sequence mapping and
alignment methods that allow rapid search and comparison to complement graph-based pangenome approaches.
Using succinct data structures, our techniques will enable interpretation of pangenomes while also developing
sublinear indexes of the pangenome for sequence search based on exploring all-vs-all genome homology. For
population genetics, we will implement analyses for GWAS, heritability, selection, and phylogeny directly on a
novel encoding of pangenome graphs based on node coverage, which captures allele zygosity across the entire
pangenome. This representation naturally captures all variation including everything from SNPs to structural vari-
ants to centromeric haplotypes. To aid exploration, we will build interactive visualizations using GPU-accelerated
algorithms to enable real-time interaction with massive graphs which provide a human-scale interface to the
overwhelming diversity of data present in pangenomes. Throughout this work, we will engage diverse genomics
communities via open source software, hands-on workshops, conferences, and integration with public databases.
We will target bioinformaticians, geneticists, clinicians, and evolutionary biologists to reﬁne methodology. Broader
pangenome adoption can help overcome reference bias, empower more equitable genomics, and increase un-
derstanding of human genetic diversity to advance health. Our user-focused pangenome tools seek to make
these expansive resources tangible and integrated for the genomics community to catalyze new ﬁndings."

The ADVANCE Cancer Health Disparities Research (CHDR) Training Program at the University of Southern
California (USC) is based on a strong foundation of biomedical research, population science training, and
professional education at USC and the Department of Population and Public Health Sciences (DPPHS). The
ADVANCE CHDR will use a comprehensive approach to enhance the knowledge, skill, and capacity of
predoctoral students in minority health, cancer health disparities research, and community engagement. We will
do this through two key and highly integrated pillars: (1) academic training in population sciences and the
science of cancer health disparities, and (2) professional training in cancer health disparities research. The
proposed activities within the academic training pillar are designed to increase knowledge and understanding
about key concepts in minority health and cancer health disparities research through various academic offerings
that include a new Health Equity Certificate training, elective courses offered at DPPHS that will complete
the core training in epidemiology, biostatistics, or health behavior research of our trainees, scientific seminar
offerings to enrich the learning of our trainees, with unique focus on cancer health disparities, and hands-on
training in applying this knowledge through mentored cancer health disparities research, which will culminate in
the PhD dissertation. This academic learning activities will be complemented with activities that will sustain the
professional education pillar and will include training navigation to provide precision mentoring and
professional and career development through workshops and participation in scientific activities. To enhance
the professional education pillar, the ADVANCE CHDR will provide community engagement training through
participation in community outreach and engagement events, community education opportunities, and
partnership with a community mentor to work on community-based projects. These two training pillars will work
synergistically to promote diversity in minority health and health disparities research and provide training in three
key areas: health disparities/health equity research, multi-level preventive interventions, and methodology to
prepare the next generation for careers in cancer health disparities."
10977861,"Motivation: Wireless technology has largely bypassed MRI. In an era of wireless earbuds and
cell phones, MRI receive arrays remain hindered by bulky cabling and the commensurate RF
baluns, and coax coupling that degrade performance. The simple act of adjusting the cable
routing inside the MRI bore is a commonplace nuisance and source of lost time for patient
handling. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to cut the cord - to demonstrate fully functional
wireless receive array technology. This capability will open new avenues for array design and
applications. It will become possible to create an open interface standard that is vendor-
agnostic. Through wireless operation, arrays can finally be made wearable, without fear of
mechanical fragility of the connections, thereby bringing the full SNR potential of wearable
arrays to fruition.
Approach: To architect MRI wireless arrays, we will develop all the necessary support
technology, including wireless power transfer, low-power balun-free MRI receiver electronics,
wireless coil Q-spoiling, ultra-wide band microwave short-range serial links, and microwave
phase and motion synchronization systems. Notably, we can achieve these goals without need
of custom IC fabrication for wireless interfaces. We will also leverage the compressibility of MRI
k-space data by factors of 3x or more, to stream MRI data over multiple band-limited microwave
channels. Moreover, we will leverage these added microwave fields to support motion,
respiratory and cardiac sensing, to effectively provide non-contact vital signs sensing as a free
byproduct of the wireless approach. The wireless arrays will be constructed and compared to
geometrically equivalent topologies, for image quality and safety. The net outcome will be a
wireless array with data transmission recovered and streamed over gigabit ethernet links to
standard network interfaces. This approach will provide excellent synergy with recent efforts to
make wearable lightweight conformable MRI receive arrays.
Significance: The result of this project will overcome a common irritant and inhibitor of MRI
receive arrays by removing the cable interface. This will enable wearable arrays to achieve their
full imaging potential, while providing an interface that is vendor neutral, safer, and cheaper."
10978046,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Despite 20 years of unprecedented growth in the number of criminal justice-involved older adults (those under
arrest, in court, in prison or jail, on probation or parole), the knowledge needed to develop evidence-based
interventions for this population with high rates of early onset disease, disability and behavioral and social risk
factors, is deeply under-developed. To address a dearth of research about this population, we launched the
Aging Research in Criminal Justice Health (ARCH) Network in 2019 to support multidisciplinary scholars
across all career stages to study the life course experiences of older adults involved in the criminal legal
system and the drivers of later life health disparities in this population. We now propose to renew the ARCH
Network to sustain and grow our early research success in studying key social determinants of health in this
rapidly growing population. The ARCH Network has enjoyed tremendous success, including developing a
superb group of early investigators and supporting established researchers to focus on this emerging area of
research. The ARCH Network draws on people with a tremendous diversity of background reflecting a wide
range of professional disciplines, including medicine, public health, nursing, criminology, law, psychology,
social work, and others. Since our launch, our scholars have published nearly 80 manuscripts in high impact
journals regarding the health of older adults in the criminal legal system, and have competed successfully for
extramural grant funding, including career development awards and R-series NIH awards. Many have been
recognized for outstanding scholarship at national conferences.
The Aims of our renewal application are to: 1) build upon the multidisciplinary research network we established
during the first ARCH network grant by creating specialized research cores including: Research Education;
Team Science; and Translation and Dissemination to advance research on the health and social drivers of
criminal legal system involvement and health disparities among older adults over the life course; and 2)
support new and established scientists to develop and conduct life course research on the health of older
adults in the criminal legal system through technical assistance and mentorship, pilot and exploratory research
funding, and opportunities for networking to develop new multidisciplinary research collaborations. The ARCH
Network will ensure that geriatric principles are front and center in studying the health and healthcare needs of
justice-involved older adults and will continue to refine and realize a research agenda that can inform carceral
and community healthcare systems about opportunities across the life course where programmatic and policy
interventions can be tested to reduce health disparities."
10977408,"Low back pain is the #1 contributor to years lived with disability (CLBP; pain persisting for ≥3 months). An
obstacle to reducing the societal burden of CLBP is that most treatments have only small effects (~5-10%
improvements in functional limitations and pain) when compared to a control treatment.
 Lumbar radiofrequency ablation (LRFA) is a minimally invasive procedure that is widely performed for
CLBP. It can be used in patients for whom CLBP is isolated to the lumbar facet joints, defined by pain relief
(“positive responses”) after local anesthetic medial branch blocks (MBBs) to the medial branch nerves. LRFA
applies a thermal lesion to these nerves, temporarily reducing or eliminating CLBP. Unlike most CLBP
treatments, LRFA can result in large improvements in properly selected patients. However, LRFA is
neurodestructive, has potential adverse effects, and there is conflicting evidence regarding its effectiveness as
seen in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Experts have noted that those RCTs showing no effects of LRFA
may be explained by (1) poor LRFA technique insufficient to adequately lesion the medial branches, and (2)
suboptimal clinical selection criteria for identifying LRFA candidates.
 The most stringent evidence-based guidelines for LRFA technique and patient selection are those of the
Spine Intervention Society (SIS). The SIS guidelines mandate various aspects of technique to optimize medial
branch lesioning and consequent improvements in CLBP. They also include stringent clinical screening criteria
for determining appropriate LRFA candidates, such as requiring ≥80% pain improvement to define positive
MBB responses, and 2 separate sets of comparative MBBs with low anesthetic volume (<0.5cc).
 A definitive RCT of LRFA vs. control has yet to be conducted. Despite this, LRFA using conventional
electrodes (LRFA-C) and new technological modifications to LRFA are now commonly used. These
modifications are intended to make the procedure easier to perform and faster than LRFA-C. Among these
modifications, LRFA using multi-tined electrodes (LRFA-M) has shown the greatest promise. However,
there are no RCTs examining whether LRFA-M improves clinical outcomes compared to a simulated LRFA
control procedure, or whether it is actually easier or faster to perform than LRFA-C.
 We propose A Superiority Trial of Lumbar Radiofrequency Ablation for Low back pain, or “ASTRAL”: a
definitive, double-blind, 3-arm, multicenter trial to examine the effectiveness of LRFA-C and LRFA-M,
each compared to a simulated ablation control procedure (simulated LRFA). ASTRAL will use the SIS criteria
for LRFA technique and patient selection. Aim 1 is to compare the effectiveness of LRFA-C with simulated
LRFA for improving back-related functional limitations. Aim 2 is to compare the effectiveness of LRFA-M with
simulated LRFA for improving back-related functional limitations. Secondary aims will compare LRFA-C and
LRFA-M with regards to procedure duration, radiation dose, and patient pain intensity during the procedure."

Obesity is a common, serious, and costly chronic disease that continues to increase in the world. Understanding
the causes and determinants of obesity is a critical step toward developing effective policies and treatments to
prevent this pandemic. The fundamental cause of obesity and overweight is an imbalance of energy homeostasis
between calorie consumption and expenditure. Energy homeostasis is strictly regulated by the central nervous
system, and the hypothalamus is a brain region thought to play a critical role in the regulation of energy balance.
The perifornical area of the anterior hypothalamus (PeFAH) was identified in 2015 and its function is unknown.
The PeFAH has extensive extracellular structures, perineuronal nets (PNNs), to enmesh GABAergic neurons. I
found that chronic disruption of PNNs in the PeFAH decreases the excitability of GABAergic neurons and
prevents high-fat diet induced weight gain and fat mass accumulation. The first objective of this proposal is to
use loss-of-function and gain-of-function model to determine the functional relevance of PeFAH PNNs in energy
homeostasis in mice fed with high-fat diet. The second objective is to determine how PNNs regulate
excitability/synaptic activity of GABAPeFAH neurons, and I will also use pharmacological, chemogenetic and
genetic methods to further investigate the possible orexigenic role of GABAPeFAH neurons in energy homeostasis.
The proposed studies are expected to substantially advance the understanding about the newly discovered brain
region in regulation of feeding behavior and metabolic process in general. They could be novel therapeutic
targets for the treatment or prevention of obesity or overeating."
10994198,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 During development, specific synaptic partners connect in order to ensure proper neural circuit function,
but how these connections are disassembled during neurodegeneration is less well understood. In rodent
experimental glaucoma (EG) models, synapse loss occurs early, preceding retinal ganglion cell (RGC) dendrite
retraction and cell death. Converging evidence in rodents suggests that specific RGC types are more susceptible
to elevated intraocular pressure, but little is known about retinal circuit disassembly in glaucomatous primate
retina. Indeed, significant differences in mice, which lack a lamina cribrosa and macula and have dissimilar RGC
types, limit the translation and generalizability of findings to humans. It is critically important to address this
knowledge gap in order to advance successful development of clinically relevant diagnostics and novel treatment
approaches, such as neuroprotection, gene therapy, and cell-based vision restoration strategies. Here we
assemble a highly collaborative team of investigators with complementary expertise well-matched to our goal
of systematically determining the connectivity, function, and transcriptomes of RGCs undergoing circuit
and synapse disassembly in glaucomatous primate retina. Our approach builds on a well-established rhesus
macaque non-human primate (NHP) model of experimental glaucoma that closely recapitulates structural and
functional changes observed in human glaucoma, and permits detailed and precise staging of disease. Based
on our studies in mice and preliminary data in NHP, we hypothesize that specific microcircuits in the injured
adult NHP retina may exhibit susceptibility in connectivity and function, which is reflected in differential
gene expression. To test this hypothesis, we apply rigorous quantitative electrophysiological, anatomical, and
molecular assessments focusing on the four main RGC types in NHP retina: ON and OFF midget and parasol
ganglion cells. Aim 1 will use high-density multielectrode arrays, single cell recordings, and Patch-seq to identify
the functional RGC types that are vulnerable in NHP EG and probe their transcriptomes to reveal mechanistic
insights and novel therapeutic targets. Aim 2 will determine the specificity and patterns of circuit and synapse
disassembly in NHP EG from both lamina-specific and cell type-specific perspectives using detailed circuit and
synapse mapping. The proposal is innovative because it brings together multi-modal function, morphologic, and
molecular analyses, and is significant because it focuses on the four main RGC types in primate that account for
the majority of human vision and are affected in glaucoma. We will generate significant resources for the scientific
community and reveal insights into retinal circuit disassembly and the potential for circuit repair in a highly
clinically relevant model of glaucoma."

The normal aortic valve is tricuspid with three leaflets derived from multiple cell lineages during
embryogenesis. Aortic valve patterning is genetically controlled where individual cells in the valve-
forming field refine their fates and functions in response to positional and environmental cues. Genetic
mutations that alter cell-cell and cell-environmental signals can disrupt the developmental process,
leading to anomalous aortic valve, for example, bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). Affecting ~2% of the
general population in US, BAV is the most common congenital heart defect. Fusion of two of three
leaflets or absence of one leaflet during embryogenesis results in various BAV subtypes. After birth,
over half of BAV patients develop calcific aortic valve disease with no effective medicine, while BAV subtypes
have varied cardiac complications, which decide the disease outcome. With the International Bicuspid Aortic
Valve Consortium (BAVCon) being established to identify the genetic causes of BAV in humans, animal models
of BAV are critically needed to elucidate morphogenic and cellular mechanisms of human BAV, as well as
molecular signals that control aortic valve patterning in order to identify therapeutic targets for disease
prevention. To this end, we have generated two mouse models of BAV with distinct signaling defects and
anomalous leaflets. In the first model, knocking out notch receptor 1 (Notch1) in valve endocardial cells (VECs)
recapitulates the most common human BAV subtype – fusion of left and right coronary leaflets, which are mainly
derived from VECs by epithelial to mesenchymal transformation. This model also reveals that the NOTCH1-
TNFa signaling from VECs controls apoptosis of valve mesenchymal cells (VMCs). In the second model, deleting
SRY-box transcription factor 17 (Sox17) in VECs results in a rare but more severe type of BAV – absence of
non-coronary leaflet, of which VMCs arise predominantly from the second heart field (SHF)-derived
cardiomyocytes, and the patterning defect is associated with reduced VEC-VMC PDGFB signaling. Based on
these findings, we hypothesize that coordinated VEC-VMC signals control normal aortic valve patterning and
their disruption leads to various BAV subtypes, in the context of the origin and location of affected cells. We will
test this hypothesis in two Aims. Aim 1 is planned to reveal coordinated VEC-VMC signal networks during normal
aortic valve patterning and identify signaling events that are disrupted in various BAV subtypes. Aim 2 is designed
to uncover the functions of PDGF signaling in normal aortic valve patterning as well as use it as an example to
illustrate how a disrupted signaling event can alters cell fate and function, leading to a specific BAV. Successful
accomplishment of these Aims will provide new insights into BAV pathogenesis, with a broad implication in
congenital heart valve disease."
10985102,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Preterm infants and their mothers are frequently exposed to toxic stress resulting from the neonatal intensive
care unit (NICU) environment. Toxic stress develops when stress becomes excessive and causes prolonged
activation of biologic stress responses, potentially disrupting brain circuitry and normal physiologic systems.
Toxic stress increases the risk for alterations in stress responses and epigenetic alterations in both preterm
infants and their mothers.8 Alterations in the glucocorticoid-related gene NR3C1 and the promoter region of the
serotonin promoter gene SLC6A4 have been linked to toxic stress in both preterm infants and women during
the perinatal period.4,8 Infant toxic stress from the NICU environment arises from repeated and aberrant
exposures to excessive light, sound, and painful stimuli during a period of critical neurologic development.
Mother experiences of toxic stress result from an often-unexpected preterm birth, alterations in parental role
attainment, infant illness, and the sights and sounds of the NICU.9 This toxic stress must be considered in the
context of the maternal social determinants of health (SDoH) as early life stress is directly linked to the built
and social environment of their mothers.10 Despite this, the mechanisms connecting infant toxic stress to
maternal factors remains ill-defined. Importantly, the investigations accounting for a possible dyadic
relationship between the preterm infant and mother are nonexistent. Although the relationship between SDoH
and epigenetic changes has been documented, there remains a critical need to identify the biomechanisms
responsible for connecting the dyads’ structural and intermediaries SDoH with toxic stress from the NICU
environment and the resulting physiologic adaptations and disruptions. The purpose of this study is to
delineate the impact of maternal SDoH and toxic stress from the NICU environment for preterm infants and
their mothers. In this descriptive, longitudinal study, we will enroll 80 preterm infants (< 32 weeks gestation)
and their birth mothers. The primary aim is to evaluate how maternal structural and intermediary SDoH and
toxic stress from the NICU environment are associated with alterations in methylation of NR3C1 and SLC6A4
in preterm infants and their mothers. The secondary aim is to evaluate whether toxic stress moderates the
relationship between maternal SDoH and methylation of NR3C1 and SLC6A4. Finally, we will explore preterm
infant and maternal DNA methylation for concordance. Analyses will include descriptions of DNAm changes,
Actor-Partner Interdependence Modeling, and general linear mixed model development. The results from this
study will provide much needed information regarding the cumulative impact of toxic stress from the NICU
environment and will guide future development and testing of target stress reducing interventions in this
vulnerable population. The proposed research is feasible and advance my training goals and help guarantee
the success of my research career."

This proposal is a request to purchase and install pen housing for groups of nonhuman primates. These pens
will be used primarily to house harem breeding groups of pigtail macaques (Macaca nemestrina). The
Washington National Primate Research Center (WaNPRC) manages the largest domestic breeding colony of
the pigtail macaque, M. nemestrina, to provide animal models for use in biomedical research. To save costs,
the bulk of the breeding colony is housed at the WaNPRC’s Arizona Breeding Colony (ABC). However, this
requires that animals be transported to Seattle for research assignments. Some research projects require the
use of pregnant animals or pre-weaned juveniles, and it is necessary to breed animals in Seattle to meet these
needs. Currently this breeding is performed in a timed-mating pair-housing situation.
Installation of breeding pens in Seattle will increase production and efficiency while improving animal welfare.
Housing animals in harem groups will eliminate the need for monitoring female reproductive cycles, scheduling
mating days, and introducing breeding pairs. Housing the breeding animals in pens rather than individual cages
improves overall animal welfare in two ways: Socialization in groups provides significantly improved
psychological well-being when compared to single housing or even pair housing, and the increased total space
(horizontal and vertical) in pens compared to cages improves both physical and psychological well-being. The
cost of pens is significantly lower than the cost of cages per sq ft of floor space. In summary, this project will:
1) Increase efficiency of Seattle breeding program.
2) Improve animal welfare by increasing socialization and housing space.
3) Increase animal availability and decrease lead time for initiating research projects."

Prescription opioid abuse, addiction and overdose are major burdens to patients and society, resulting in significant costs,
illnesses, and deaths. The intertwined issues of i) the ongoing abuse of prescription opioids, and ii) reluctance of prescribers
to write prescriptions for opioid analgesics, have resulted in the under-treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe pain.
Several abuse-deterrent opioid products (primarily formulations) are currently marketed, but they fall short of being resistant
to abuse. Notably, currently marketed abuse deterrent technologies do not effectively deter one of the most common forms
of opioid abuse – swallowing an increased number of tablets or capsules than are prescribed.
In order to address this crisis Ensysce Biosciences has created two complementary, novel technologies that control the
release of known opioids. The abuse resistant and overdose protection features of Ensysce Biosciences’ TAAP™ (Trypsin
Activated Abuse Protection) with MPAR® (multi-pill-abuse-resistant) prodrugs are built into the chemical modification of
the opioid and are not just formulation-based changes.
PF614-MPAR is the first opioid being developed with overdose protection. PF614-MPAR is a combination product of the
TAAP-oxycodone prodrug, PF614, and the trypsin inhibitor nafamostat. Because exposure to trypsin is required to activate
PF614 for the release of oxycodone, it provides a number of features that deter abuse while addition of nafamostat adds the
overdose protection. As a combination product, we have filed two INDs to evaluate both PF614 and the trypsin inhibitor
separately for safety and PK, and have filed a third IND to evaluate the combination. The data from the Phase 1 study that
evaluated the combination of PF614 and nafamostat, have provided the first proof of concept that we can deliver pain
relieving levels of oxycodone from PF614-MPAR administration and still achieve overdose protection.
The overdose protection of PF614-MPAR only is activated when more than a prescribed dose is taken at one time. The
amount of nafamostat in a dose unit of PF614-MPAR is designed to be ineffective when taken at the prescribed dose.
However, small increments over the prescribed dose or if taken in large excess, the increased amount of nafamostat will
inhibit the trypsin conversion of PF614 to oxycodone reducing the opioid release. It is designed to put the brakes on the
activation of PF614 if too much is taken at one time, averting an overdose.
We have now examined the PF614-MPAR 25 mg dosage strength in a two-part Phase 1 study and found that the combination
showed an equivalent safety profile to PF614 alone. A 25 mg PF614-MPAR dose unit was defined in Part 1 of the study
and proof-of-concept was demonstrated successfully when overdose protection was provided when excess PF614-MPAR
25 mg was taken simultaneously in Part 2. PF614-MPAR was designed to allow an anticipated prescribed dose of 1 to 2
dose units twice daily to provide relief from severe pain. If more than a prescribed dose is consumed the increased amount
of nafamostat ingested from the combination product is sufficient to inhibit the activity of trypsin, therefore allowing excess
inactive PF614 prodrug to pass through the body unchanged and ultimately prevent an overdose.
The objective of this proposal is to continue the clinical development of PF614-MPAR ensure all dosage strengths 25, 50
and 100 mg, have the same ability to provide pain relief at prescribed dose but overdose protection at greater than prescribed
dose levels. A multi-ascending dose study will evaluate PF614-MPAR 25, 50 and 100 mg for safety and ensure that repeat
dosing of the combination product does not result in attenuation of the oxycodone release from PF614 at anticipated
prescribed doses of 2 pill equivalents delivered orally, twice daily. These studies will be carried out in parallel with non-
clinical studies that are needed to support a New Drug Application."

People with Down syndrome (DS), the genetic condition caused by trisomy 21 (T21), display a unique clinical
profile across the lifespan. Early on, children with DS present stunted growth and neurodevelopmental delays.
Later in life, adults with DS experience an atypical form of accelerated ageing. Furthermore, they also experience
a differential clinical risk profile, marked by high risk of congenital heart defects, leukemias, autism spectrum
disorders, seizure disorders, autoimmune conditions, and Alzheimer’s disease, among others. Therefore,
research efforts investigating the mechanisms by which T21 causes the hallmarks of DS, as well as the factors
that modify these effects, will accelerate discoveries to improve health outcomes in this population.
Within this context, in 2016 we launched the Human Trisome Project (HTP), a natural history of study of DS,
including deep annotation of clinical metadata, cognitive phenotyping, a multidimensional biobank, and
generation of -omics datasets. The HTP has enrolled >1150 participants, >750 with T21, from all around the
USA. The HTP was one of the first studies that released data in INCLUDE Data Hub, including unpublished
multi-omics datasets and its biospecimen catalog. Despite these important efforts, the potential of the HTP
remains unfulfilled, as it does not capture the massive diversity of the global community with T21. Therefore, we
propose to develop an international component for the INCLUDE Project through the following Specific Aims:
1. To develop a network of research sites across Latin America. Led by a polyglottal and multicultural team
at the Linda Crnic Institute for Down Syndrome, we recently launched the HTP – Latin America Network to
support research activities in México, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, and Chile. Each Latin America site provides
massive expertise through decades of managing the largest DS clinics in their respective countries, while also
contributing populations of unparalleled racial, ethnic, and cultural diversity.
2. To define the clinical and neurodevelopmental profile of Latinos with Down syndrome. Although Latinos
are the fastest growing segment of the population with DS in the USA, little is known about potential differences
in their developmental and clinical profiles. Therefore, we propose to complete a comprehensive annotation of
demographic information, social determinants of health, co-occurring conditions, and lifestyle factors.
3. To identify biosignatures associated with differential features of Latinos with Down syndrome. We will
complete a multi-omics investigation of the variable pathophysiology of DS in the Latino population, including
analyses of the genome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, immune system, and microbiome to define
associations between differential developmental and clinical features and underlying biological processes.
Altogether, our efforts will provide unmatched diversity to the INCLUDE Project in terms of the population studied,
investigational approaches employed, and diversity of the researchers involved."

GelSana is developing the Provasliex GelTM, a zwitterionic hydrogel that delivers controlled release of platelet
derived growth factor (PDGF) to address the need for better treatments for impaired wound healing associated
with diabetes. There are approximately 37 million people in the U.S. with diabetes and nearly 25% of patients
will suffer from diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) and lower leg ulcerations in their lifetime. Lower limb amputations
associated with impaired wound healing and lower leg ulceration are the primary reason for hospitalization of
patients with diabetes leading to 154,000 lower limb amputations per year in the U.S. The current standard of
care approach for treatment of diabetic wounds are to use standard gauze and antibacterial solutions to reduce
infection, but these approaches do not address underlying issues associated with inflammation of the wound.
Becaplermin (Regranex) is a topical gel that provides PDGF to the wound bed that has been shown to be safe
and can improve diabetic wound healing. Unfortunately, Regranex is limited clinically, as dressings must be
changed frequently, often 2x per day, as biologics like PDGF degrade fairly rapidly in the wound healing
environment and therefore must be consistently supplied to have a therapeutic impact. There is significant
potential for controlled release of PDGF over time to significantly improve the rate of wound healing and reduce
the frequency of dressing changes for patients. To address this need, GelSana has developed a zwitterionic
hydrogel that repels protein adsorption, prevents the foreign body response, reduces inflammation by modulating
macrophage state, and supports controlled release of PDGF. The Provasliex Gel (zwitterionic hydrogel + PDGF)
will have a multifactorial impact on wound healing as the hydrogel alone reduces inflammation in the wound bed,
protects PDGF from degradation, and enables consistent controlled release to promote wound healing. Prior to
this Phase I submission, GelSana has demonstrated controlled release of PDGF across several days, that the
zwitterionic hydrogel alone reduces healing time of wounds in a diabetic mouse model, and that the hydrogel
limits activation of an inflammatory macrophage phenotype. The goal of this project will be to demonstrate
feasibility towards improved wound healing with Provasliex Gel in mouse and pig models of diabetic wound
healing compared to Regranex. Commercialization of Provasliex Gel would significantly improve patient
morbidity outcomes through accelerated wound healing and would substantially improve patient quality of life by
reducing the frequency of painful dressing changes."
11007011,"Comparative Efficacy of Therapeutics for Clostridioides difficile Infection
Biotherapeutics Inc (BTI) is an emerging biotech company that synergistically combines the power of advanced
computational modeling with translational experimentation to accelerate the development of novel precision
immunology therapeutics. Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a gastrointestinal (GI) infection, established
upon disruption of gut microbiome commonly following antibiotic administration. Almost half a million people in
the United States are affected by CDI every year, causing an economic burden of over $6 billion..
Despite the status of CDI as an antibiotic-associated infection, the standard of care (SOC) for CDI is dominated
by antimicrobials, reporting high infection recurrence rates. Novel antimicrobial-free strategies have been
developed to address this dichotomy, including fecal microbiome transplantation and administration of
monoclonal antibodies against C. difficile toxin B (TcdB). However, safety concerns and high costs, create the
need for more effective, antimicrobial-free therapeutics with novel mechanisms of action.
BTI has developed a novel, oral, once-daily, first-in-class, immunoregulatory therapeutic being evaluated in
clinical development for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that provides therapeutic efficacy in acute and
recurrent CDI, in an antimicrobial-free, microbiome-preserving manner. This SBIR aims to accelerate the
development of this novel therapeutic through a head-to-head comparison of the efficacy of our product
candidate versus traditional and recently approved therapeutics for the treatment of CDI.
The specific aims of this project are to:
AIM 1. Evaluate the comparative efficacy of our new product candidate versus FDA-approved
therapeutics for CDI in two recurrent mouse models. We will assess weight loss, disease activity,
histopathological lesions, and colitis through flow cytometry immunophenotype and gene expression profile.
AIM 2. Compare the effects of our new product candidate versus current therapeutics in modulating gut
microbiome dynamics during CDI. In a recurrent model of CDI, we will assess gut microbiome composition
and diversity, plus abundance of C. difficile-resistant strains through 16S sequencing and metabolomic analysis.
Expected outcomes: i) ≥ 30% decrease of histopathological scores; ii) ≥ 40% decrease of Th17 infiltration; and
iii) ≥ 60% increase of alpha diversity compared to SOC.
The SBIR Phase II will validate the therapeutic efficacy in hamster and pig models of CDI. finalize IND-enabling
studies and file an IND for treating CDI.
Commercial application: The long-term goal of this project is to develop a new line of host-centered small
molecule therapeutics that are safer and more effective than standard of care (SOC) treatments for CDI, with
reduced disease severity and recurrence rates, and initial clinical testing expected by 2024."

In a few months’ time, the emergence of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), a highly contagious disease
resulting from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), sickened millions and
killed hundreds of thousands of people in the United States alone. As with many other communicable and non-
communicable diseases, African Americans disproportionately bear the burden of elevated rates of COVID-19-
related morbidity and mortality. The rise in negative sentiments towards wearing masks in public, interpersonal
and structural racism, and inability to shelter-in-place further exacerbate risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure for
members of vulnerable populations, including African Americans. With recent projections estimating that nearly
50,000 more Americans will die of COVID-19-related complications by December 2020, with at least 30% likely
to be African American, it is clear that current public health efforts, which are overwhelmingly expert-driven and
top-down, are failing. As such, innovative solutions that: 1) empower and equip communities to play an active
role in promoting public health and responsiveness, 2) leverage community assets and multisectoral
partnerships, and 3) facilitate a sense of unity and collective responsibility are sorely needed if we are to
contain SARS-CoV-2 and eliminate COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality, particularly amongst those
suffering disproportionately worse outcomes. Public health campaigns and non-pharmaceutical interventions
(NPIs) that are community-driven and developed in collaboration with community members, public health
agencies, and researchers may offer a more acceptable and effective approach that could enable the US to
drastically reduce COVID-19 transmission and address individual and socio-structural barriers that lead to
worse COVID-19-related outcomes among African Americans. Our study goals are to use a crowdsourcing
contest to identify exceptional ideas that promote COVID-19 testing and encourage the public to adopt health-
promotive behaviors. We will then conduct a randomized experiment to examine the impact of the contest on
the targeted health-promotive behaviors. Next, in partnership with Project Grace, an academic-community
partnership in rural NC, we will initiate an NPI called the Rapid Response Team, which will be a community-
based contact tracing and case investigation program that will focus on identifying local COVID-19 infections in
their communities, providing assistance and information regarding implementing safety protocols, and meeting
existing needs of community members within a rural community in North Carolina by leveraging NCCARE360,
a new digital, statewide coordinated care network intended to better connect individuals to local services and
resources. Then, we will determine the feasibility, acceptability, and reach of the Rapid Response Team
regarding contacting community members and linking them to local resources as needed, increasing COVID-
19 testing, and increasing the practice of the 3Ws among adults in rural, Eastern North Carolina."
10999907,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sarcoidosis is a systemic condition characterized by non-caseating granulomas affecting ~200,000 Americans.
Granuloma infiltration in the myocardium leads to inflammation, fibrogenesis, ventricular arrhythmias, and
increased morbidity and mortality. Imaging determinants of cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) include late gadolinium
enhancement (LGE) on cardiac MR (CMR) indicating fibrosis, uptake of 18F-FDG on PET indicating inflamma-
tion, and perfusion deficits on 82Rb myocardial PET perfusion imaging (MPI) indicating microvascular constric-
tion secondary to either fibrosis or inflammation. Each have been identified as predictors of future clinical
events. While early immune-suppressant therapy (IST) can mitigate cardiac dysfunction and improve longer-
term outcomes, treatment guidelines for CS are not well developed. Given the deleterious effects of prolonged
IST (with corticosteroids), and the availability of combination approaches using steroids and steroid-sparing
medications, optimization of the therapeutic strategy is an important clinical need. An elevated FDG signal
(SUVmax) and its subsequent reduction are widely regarded as a trigger for IST and evidence of response to
therapy, respectively, however agreed-upon quantitative thresholds for such determinations are lacking. Our
overarching goals are, 1) to determine the imaging response to therapy of multiple imaging parameters (Aims
1&2) and to establish thresholds that are associated with changes in cardiac function (LVEF and NYHA Class)
after IST; 2) to correlate imaging parameters with changes in cardiac function and change in LGE (fibrosis)
after IST and with the occurrence of adverse clinical events (Aim 3). We propose a prospective study, with
serial imaging beyond completion of IST to assess sustained changes after IST, comprehensive imaging (LGE-
CMR, FDG PET, Rb MPI, advanced CMR mapping, and quantitative perfusion measurements), and a
standardized IST regimen to improve generalizability of our findings. We will enroll 174 patients with confirmed
CS (biopsy-proven extra-CS with cardiac involvement according to WASOG and HRS criteria or biopsy-proven
CS with clinical evidence of extra-CS), a perfusion deficit on MPI, and who are treatment naïve at baseline.
112 patients with elevated FDG will undergo IST and serial imaging at Time Point (TP) 1 prior to IST, TP2,
after IST (12-16 weeks), and TP3, after steroid tapering (28-36 weeks). Clinical adverse events (cardiac arrest,
VT, heart failure, new heart block) will be monitored for the duration of the study. The central innovation in
the study is the development of a multi-parametric approach and the hypothesis that composite multi-
parametric measures will be superior predictors of overall risk and subsequently response to therapy. In Aim 1,
we focus on SUVmax and other standard imaging parameters, addressing an immediate need. In Aim 2, we
evaluate advanced CMR mapping parameters (T2, T1, extracellular volume (ECV)), quantitative myocardial
perfusion parameters, and develop novel parameters using radiomics analysis. In Aim 3, we develop a multi-
parametric model to predict future adverse events and develop a novel Artificial Intelligence-based approach."

Congenital heart disease (CHD) leads to severe morbidity and mortality in children in the US and worldwide.
Despite this impact on child health, we simply do not understand the genetic causes of CHD. Indeed, we recently
showed that ion channels play a critical role in CHD, LR patterning, and early germ layer specification. We
previously outlined an ion channel signaling network where ERG channels suppress voltage-gated calcium
channels and mTOR signaling enabling the exit from pluripotency to germ layer differentiation. However, this
study raised several additional questions. For example, do the germ layers have different electrophysiological
properties? What are the calcium-responsive transcription factors that activate mTOR signaling? The goal of
this proposal is to answer these questions.
We propose, and our preliminary data support, that ion channels define a new paradigm for cell signaling in early
embryonic cells. Our data support an electrophysiological model where specific germ layer fates are dependent
on an ion channel network. Our overarching hypothesis is that ion channels define electrical membrane potential
and regulate voltage-gated Ca2+ channels that establish an exit from pluripotency towards specific cell fates,
gastrulation, and LR patterning providing a plausible mechanism for our patients with Htx and CHD. Our
electrophysiological pathway then integrates with biochemical signaling pathways that define specific cell fates
in the embryo.
In this proposal, we will focus on understanding the differences in electrical properties of the different germ layers
using both electrophysiological measurements and gene knockdown in Xenopus. We will then also identify the
transcription factors that regulate mTOR signaling in the early embryo. Our published results strongly point
towards ETS and CRE transcription factors, and we will identify precisely which transcription factors play a key
role in mTOR signaling and pluripotency.
A major strength of our proposal is our expertise; we have forged a collaboration between Xenopus
developmental biologists and electrophysiologists that will allow us to rigorously investigate membrane potential
as an embryonic patterning mechanism."
10999495,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect 47 million people worldwide with an annual global
cost of $818 billion. The risk of developing ADRD is disproportionately borne by older adults with multiple
chronic conditions from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups (URGs). One such high risk group is older
survivors of critical illness who were admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs). Nearly half of ICU survivors
experience subjective cognitive decline (SCD), i.e., perceived decline in memory and thinking even with normal
objective cognitive data. With over 5 million adult ICU admissions in the US each year, an intervention reducing
SCD in older ICU survivors could significantly prevent or lower the incidence of ADRD. Thus, there is an urgent
need for an inclusive randomized controlled trial (RCT) to rigorously test whether a novel, accessible, and
scalable intervention can reduce SCD in a diverse cohort of older ICU survivors. One potential target for such
interventions is depression in ICU survivors. To date, there are no large scale RCTs which have rigorously
tested whether depression focused psychotherapies, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), reduce SCD
in a diverse cohort of older ICU survivors with depression. To address this knowledge gap, we have created a
multi-PI team based at the Indiana University Center for Aging Research and the Indiana Alzheimer’s Disease
Research Center, with complementary expertise in geriatric psychiatry, ICU survivorship, and psychology. Our
multi-PI team proposes a two-arm RCT called “Attenuating DEPression with Internet CBT to Slow Cognitive
Decline in Older ICU Survivors” (ADEPT-ICU). ADEPT-ICU will test the efficacy of an existing internet CBT
intervention Good Days Ahead (GDA) compared to an active control, for slowing cognitive decline among older
ICU survivors with depression after ICU hospitalization. GDA is an evidence-based, therapist-assisted CBT
that uses a scalable internet-based platform. Leveraging our well-established ICU recruitment infrastructure,
we will enroll a cohort of 300 older ICU survivors with moderate to severe depression (≥10 total score on
Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]), with ≥50% identifying as Black or Hispanic/Latino or completing ≤12
years of education. Our central hypothesis is that successful treatment of depression with the GDA intervention
will reduce SCD, slow objective cognitive decline, and improve quality of life in a diverse cohort of ICU
survivors with depression. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: Aim 1. Determine the effect
of internet CBT-D on SCD in older ICU survivors with depression. Aim 2. Determine the effect of internet CBT-
D on objective cognitive function in older ICU survivors with depression. Aim 3. Determine the effect of internet
CBT-D on quality of life in older ICU survivors with depression."

Ineffective pain management is an urgent medical crisis impacting the lives of over 50 million Americans
and millions more chronic pain patients around the world. Opiate analgesics can provide robust pain relief but
can also produce life-threatening side effects and high rates of misuse, which contributes to the ongoing
Opioid Epidemic. Unlike the off-target effects of opiates that act widely throughout the body to indiscriminately
bind mu-opioid receptors (MOR) on many cell-types, endogenous opioid peptides mediating
antinociception undergo controlled release at specific synapses from specific nociception-related cell-types.
Identifying the precise noci-ceptive cell-types that express MORs, which are regulated by endogenous opioids,
may lead to new research developments for effective circuit-targeted analgesic treatments to minimize the
need for traditional opiate anal-gesics and reduce abuse liabilities. The rostral intralaminar thalamus {rlLN) is
critical in this regard as it is known to relay nociceptive information from spinal cord and brainstem structures
to cortical regions, such as the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC). rlLN neurons express high densities of
MORs {rlLNMOR), yet it remains unknown whether endogenous forms of pain relief modulate nociceptive
activity within this rlLNMOR ➔ rACC circuit. To enhance our investigations into thalamocortical circuits in
endogenous analgesia processes, we have developed an operant conditioning assay that leverages
expectation-induced antinociception, i.e. placebo analgesia, in a drug-free manner. The F99 phase entails two
subaims. In Aim 1a, the applicant will leverage in vivo fiber photometry calcium imaging to determine
nociception and analgesia-related responses in the axonal projections of rlLNMOR ➔ rACC. In Aim 1b, to
determine the necessity of MOR signaling in thalamocortical neurons for the endogenous analgesia response,
the applicant will use an intersectional genetic and viral approach to selectively delete MORs from rlLN ➔ rACC
neurons. The KOO phase, Aim 2, will help prepare the applicant for a successful academic research career
investigating neurobiological mechanisms of gastrointestinal pain. This postdoctoral period will provide the
applicant with expertise in techniques like 2-photon calcium imaging of neural population dynamics in the brain
during visceral pain models, as well as sharpen managerial and mentoring skills necessary to succeed and
thrive as an independent research scientist. In total, successful completion of this proposal will provide insight
into neurobiological mechanisms underlying pain and analgesia, while also equipping the applicant, Lindsay
Ejoh, to uncover brain circuit mechanisms of severe and chronic gastrointestinal pain disorders under her own
independent research program."

There is a need for the development of objective measures of intraocular inflammation to better detect and
monitor uveitis. This proposal seeks funds to support early career researchers and trainees to attend the UCLA
/ American Uveitis Society (AUS) Second International Workshop on Objective Measures of Intraocular
Inflammation for Use in Clinical Trials. The goals of the 2024 Workshop will be to review the proposed outcome
measures of intraocular inflammation, how these measures relate to clinical trial design; and the potential
techniques for objective quantification of study variables. We will also review the progress toward standardization
and validation of those techniques over the five years since the 2019 UCLA/AUS workshop and to discuss plans
for future studies that will advance this field further. These goals will be addressed through our Aims by providing
a dynamic scientific venue for the discussion of evaluation of intraocular inflammation, supporting new
collaborations and discussions across a multi-disciplinary attendee population, and by fostering the career
development of early career researchers and trainees. This Workshop will feature a diverse roster of attendees
of ophthalmologists who participate in clinical research dealing with inflammatory eye diseases (uveitis
specialists, retina specialists, pediatric ophthalmologists); clinical trialists; and pharmaceutical and device
industry representatives. With this Workshop, we will also be addressing one of NEI’s Bold Predictions,
“Infrastructure for large-scale sharing and analysis of vision-related data, including definitions and
standardization of data elements and biomarkers across multiple data types, will enable knowledge discovery
and predictive disease modeling”. We will also address the NEI’s Area of Emphasis of the Immune System and
Eye Health by evaluating imaging biomarkers for disease surveillance and detection. By promoting the multi-
disciplinary exchange of ideas and by supporting early career researchers and trainees, we anticipate this
Workshop will generate new collaborations and research opportunities for the next generation of investigators.
In turn this will lead to further development of objective measures of intraocular inflammation, resulting in earlier
detection and improved monitoring of uveitis, which may prevent permanent vision loss and disability."

Antiger Therapeutics Inc is a biotech company specializing in engineering recombinant human leukocyte
antigens (HLA) and membrane proteins. In this SBIR Phase I application, we leverage this expertise to develop
targeted immunotherapies for celiac disease (CD), a global health challenge affecting approximately 100
million individuals. As a chronic autoimmune disease, CD poses serious health risks such as malnutrition,
anemia, reduced bone density, neurological disorders, and cancers like lymphoma. The current paradigm of
CD immunotherapies relies heavily on nonselective immunosuppression, but the associated toxicity limits their
long-term use. The most effective management strategy is a lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD).
However, approximately 30% of CD patients experience persistent or recurrent symptoms due to poor dietary
compliance, limited access to GFD, or the complexities of managing refractory CD. Antiger Therapeutics Inc
aims to approach CD therapy by selectively targeting the aberrant immune response. A pivotal immunogenetic
factor in CD is the HLA-DQ2 membrane protein, which presents deamidated gluten peptides to activate
pathogenic T cells and disrupt immune tolerance. Our primary objective is to develop a biologic that specifically
blocks the pathogenic T cells recognizing the gluten peptide-DQ2 (pDQ2) complex, thereby safely preventing
or reversing CD. Because the pDQ2 complex is difficult to assemble due to the inefficient pairing of DQα and
DQβ chains, we will employ novel solutions involving disulfide engineering or producing full-length membrane
proteins. Notably, the disulfide bond approach has shown promise in our recent success in generating stable
pDQ7-Fc molecules for treating antibody-mediated graft rejection. In Specific Aim 1 of this grant, we will
generate dimeric pDQ2-Fc fusion proteins with an inter-chain disulfide bond to stabilize the pDQ2 complex.
The Fc portion enables dimerization of the pDQ2 complex in an antibody-like structure. In Specific Aim 2, we
will generate pDQ2-Transmembrane proteins on detergent micelles. The transmembrane domains of full-
length α and β chains of DQ2 will promote the assembly of pDQ2 complex to be solubilized on micelles. In
both aims, we will assess the yield and purity of multimeric pDQ2 proteins and measure their inhibitory effect
on the activation of pDQ2-specific T cells. By the end of this Phase I SBIR, we expect to generate one or more
candidate proteins with acceptable production yield, purity, and function. The Phase II SBIR will focus on
testing candidate biologics in humanized murine CD models, ultimately leading toward an IND submission.
Commercially, Antiger intends to collaborate with or license the product to a pharmaceutical company for
further development, aiming to tap into the high-demand CD therapeutic market, which is projected to be worth
$3 billion by 2030. Moreover, the scalable technology holds promise for addressing other class II HLA-
associated autoimmune disorders, such as type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis."
11005881,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Vaccine-mediated protection against viral pathogens frequently depends on neutralizing antibodies. However,
the HIV-1 envelope (Env) glycoprotein gp120 is heavily and variably glycosylated, resulting in a dynamic shield
that occludes conserved neutralization epitopes, impeding development of vaccination strategies to induce
neutralization of diverse viral strains. Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) sometimes develop during chronic
HIV-1 infection, but limited information exists about how to recapitulate this process with vaccination. However,
evidence points to specific characteristics of the virus that establishes a new infection, the transmitted/founder
(T/F), and subsequent diversification of the Env viral quasispecies as important modulators for breadth
development. In our previous study, a vaccine expressing a novel clade C T/F Env (identified as Z1800M) from
a person living with HIV (PLWH) who developed elite plasma neutralization breadth, elicited the same tier 2
autologous neutralization specificity in immunized rhesus macaques (RM) as in early infection. The targeted
epitope comprised the V5 loop and portions of the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) on the Z1800M T/F Env gp120,
both highly exposed due to a pronounced lack of glycan coverage. Interestingly, exposure of CD4 contact
residues was modulated by naturally occurring changes in V5 in early escape variants. These results support
that this Env could potentially be exploited to maximize exposure of the CD4bs. To complement these results,
we acquired an extensive set of longitudinal Env sequences from PLWH Z1800M that supports strong selective
pressure during infection on two regions comprising bnAb epitopes: the CD4bs and V2 apex. Leveraging on this
wealth of data, we will use an innovative combination of sequence-based bioinformatic tools, artificial intelligence
and machine learning based in silico structural prediction approaches, and in vitro biochemical and immunologic
studies to select HIV-1 envelope vaccine immunogens that maximize exposure of epitopes recognized by
broadly neutralizing antibodies, including the CD4bs. We proposed to immunize nonhuman primates with the
Z1800M T/F Env to expose the CD4bs and sequentially boost with three longitudinal Envs down selected from
hundreds of sequences using our in silico and in vitro methods to maximize epitope exposure during vaccination.
We predict that this strategy will transition antibodies from autologous to heterologous neutralization, leading to
a translatable vaccine approach to advance into clinical studies."

CF associated metabolic diseases including CF-associated liver disease (CFLD) and CF-related diabetes
(CFRD) are leading extrapulmonary causes of mortality in CF. In 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) approved Trikafta for CF. Of concern, clinical follow-up studies show that Trikafta, despite its significant
benefits on pulmonary function, may worsen metabolic related conditions. How to mitigate CFLD and CFRD in
the post- Trikafta era now becomes a priority research topic. Genetobe is a small business that is dedicated to
the development of therapies for rare diseases. In the present work, we propose to develop novel, selective,
sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1) compounds as an adjunctive therapy for CF. This is based
on the following considerations: (i) the novel CF rabbit model that the PI has developed manifests many key
features of CF related metabolic disorders; (ii) the PI’s team recently reported that SGLT1, but not SGLT2, is
upregulated in CF affected organs in CF rabbits and CF patient samples; (iii) many SGLT inhibitor drugs have
gained successes in recent years, treating diabetes as well as additional indications (e.g., heart failure).
However, all these drugs on the market are more SGLT2 selective than SGLT1 selective; (iii) the GeneToBe
team have many prior successes in developing small molecule compounds including Lipitor and Vizimpro. Here
we hypothesize that SGLT1 selective inhibition will mitigate CF metabolic disorders and provide additive benefits
to CF patients taking Trikafta as a primary medicine. In Phase I, we’ll use artificial intelligence (AI) assisted drug
design and rational drug design to identify novel SGLT1 inhibitor compounds. These will be prioritized,
synthesized and characterized. In Phase II, we will conduct preclinical experiments in CF rabbits that carry the
most prevalent CF mutation (i.e., dF508) to test if SGLT1 inhibition by novel compounds discovered in Phase I
can alleviate CF associated metabolic disorders, with a focus on CFLD and CFRD, in combination with Trikafta
which is now the first-line medicine for CF patients with the dF508 mutation. The success of our work will
introduce a first-in-class orally available SGLT1 selective compound as a potential adjunctive therapy for treating
CF associated metabolic diseases."

The incidence of pediatric fractures is reported to be in the range of 12 to 36.1 per 1000 per year, with forearm
fractures constituting approximately 40% of all long bone fractures. A timely and accurate diagnosis of forearm
fractures is crucial to restore function and prevent complications such as persistent pain, stiffness, or growth
plate arrest. The primary diagnostic approach involves physical examination and radiography. The treatment
goal is to restore length and alignment between the distal and proximal bone fragments. While minimally
displaced fractures may necessitate only immobilization for comfort through splinting or casting, moderately or
severely displaced fractures often require reduction for realignment. Parents often take their children with
suspected fractures to adult-based or urgent care medical centers, which lack the resources required for
specialized pediatric care, leading to transfers to pediatric tertiary care centers and/or urgent consultations from
pediatric orthopedic surgeons with specialized training in pediatric orthopedic injuries. To address and mitigate
this healthcare burden, we propose the development of a machine learning framework named the Forearm
Fracture AI-driven Recommendation System (FFAIRS) to improve forearm fracture management in
pediatrics. Our primary goal is to leverage machine learning to generate recommendations for treating forearm
fractures based on clinical presentation and x-ray analysis.
Aim 1: Develop a machine learning framework for generating treatment recommendations for pediatric
forearm fractures.
Aim 2: Retrospectively evaluate FFAIRS for accurate prediction and improved patient outcomes."
11004468,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Adolescent depression is a major public health concern associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We
know that adolescent depression varies considerably in severity and course, but its underlying mechanisms
remain unknown. This proposal addresses this concern, aiming to identify biobehavioral predictors of illness
trajectory in adolescents to inform treatment influencing its course. Our overall hypothesis is that reward
dysfunction and its underlying neuro-immunological mechanisms contribute to maintenance of depression in
youth. We propose the following model: (1) peripheral inflammation (e.g., cytokines, kynurenines) is associated
with anhedonia; (2) inflammation extends to the CNS, inducing oxidative stress [↓glutathione (GSH, antioxidant)]
and GABA (inhibitory neurotransmitter) deficits; (3) such neuro-chemical changes alter the reward circuitry,
leading to anhedonia, and contribute to depression progression. In support, we documented that of adolescent
depression’s core symptoms, only anhedonia—reflecting deficits in reward processes—and not irritability was
associated with worse outcome, including suicidality and chronicity. We also reported associations between
circulatory cytokines and kynurenines with both anhedonia and reward neurocircuitry. Utilizing proton MR
spectroscopy (1H MRS), we showed that decreased anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) GABA in adolescent
depression was driven by anhedonia. Additionally, using fMRI, we mapped striatal-based connectivity in relation
to anhedonia and documented distinct neural activation patterns of reward anticipation and attainment—both
reward processes that contribute to anhedonia. In pilot studies, we found that ACC GABA and reward-
anticipation brain activation predicted anhedonia severity at 2-year follow-up. Building upon our compelling
findings to date, we propose a prospective study of reward processes and neuroimmunological mechanisms,
with the goal to identify modifiable pathways predictive of depression course in adolescents. We will study 120
adolescents with depressive symptoms. Three in-laboratory comprehensive clinical evaluation and computerized
reward task sessions will be done at baseline, 12-, and 24-month follow-ups. At baseline and 12 months, visits
will include: a) immune blood collection for kynurenine metabolites, immune cell profiling, and cytokine secretion
post immune stimulation (as a biological stressor); b) fMRI resting state and tasks examining distinct reward
processes (e.g., anticipation, attainment, learning); and c) 1H MRS to probe ACC GABA and striatal GSH as
indices for inflammatory neurometabolic consequences in reward-related brain regions. Outcome measures will
include anhedonia severity (primary), along with depression severity, functioning, anxiety, and suicidality.
Principled variable selection approach will address multiple comparison concerns. Dynamic causal modeling and
machine learning classification methods will explore the relationships among all examined factors."
10979140,"Candidate: I have had extensive training in fields of neuroimaging and the neurobiology of drug abuse. My
work has focused on investigating the effects of dopamine signaling in neural circuits with a focus on risky
decision-making and addiction-related phenotypes. This work has led to 12 publications in top-tier journals with
6 as first-author, multiple speaking engagements and 6 NIH fellowship awards. With a long-standing
commitment to contribute to the health of veterans, I am dedicated to developing an independent research
career at the VA focused on using multi-modal imaging to understand the pathophysiology of addiction but with
a focus on treatment and interventions.
Environment: I am pursuing this line of work at the VA Portland Health Care System and Oregon Health &
Science University, which are physically connected by an indoor sky bridge and allows complete access to a
multitude of collaborative laboratories and seminars. Through joint appointments I will have access to a full
range of technical and computing resources along with scientific/consultative support services. The activities of
the proposed project will occur with shared resources and facilities, including advanced imaging equipment
such as the Siemens 3T PRISMA MAGNETOM Trio and positron emission tomography (PET).
Research Methamphetamine (MA) use disorder is a major health problem facing our veterans. As veterans
with MA-use disorder are more likely to experience a disruption in care, an integrated approach combining
traditional treatment options and pharmacological interventions are essential in developing a comprehensive
treatment program. Although both inflammation and MA use dysregulate dopamine function, the mechanistic
link between MA-induced neuroinflammation and dopaminergic brain deficits has not been studied. This study
will therefore test a model whereby MA-induced neuroinflammation and its reduction with ibudilast influences
brain function and behavior in veterans with MA-use disorder.
 The first aim of the project will compare veterans with and without MA-use disorder to determine whether
MA-induced neuroinflammation is associated with impairments in cognitive control and abnormalities in
functional connectivity of neural networks and brain activation in response to reward in the mesocorticolimbic
system. Neuroimaging measures will include PET to quantify neuroinflammation; resting-state functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess functional connectivity of neural networks and fMRI paired with
the Monetary Incentive Delay Task (MID) to measure brain activation in response to reward. We will then
assess whether a 6-week treatment of ibudilast, an anti-inflammatory reduces neuroinflammation and improves
brain function and behavior in a randomized placebo-controlled study in veterans with MA-use disorder. If
inflammation is associated with functional brain deficits and ibudilast is proven effective in restoring function
and connectivity of neural networks, the results would be of great value in identifying biomarkers associated
with stimulant use and has the potential to advance therapeutic strategies for addiction.
Research and training goals In order to develop a broad set of research tools for this project and promote
my goal as an independent researcher, my training plan is designed to broaden my skills in neuroimaging,
pharmacotherapy and the design and development of clinical trials. The training will include formal didactic
training, hands-on laboratory experience, one-on-one supervision, and a series of meetings and workshops
sharply focused on these goals. In addition, I will receive career training from my mentor and co-mentors on
laboratory best practices including personnel management and fiscal accounting. Formal workshops will
extend this training by providing practical sessions and education seminars on communication and leadership
skills. Training to acquire these new experimental capabilities allows me to take the next step in translational
research and to investigate the mechanism of neural deficits at a more clinical level as proposed."
10976544,"Our study will address the goals of RFA-AG-24-025 by elucidating how the pathways by which key aspects of
social connectedness in social networks (SNs)—structural characteristics, functional aspects, and quality of
relationships—interact and are associated with clinically significant health behaviors of older adults with
advanced cancer. We focus on older adults with advanced cancer with an estimated survival of less than 12
months because our research shows that a) they rely heavily on social networks (SNs) for instrumental and
emotional support, b) their health behaviors are complicated by poor disease understanding, c) aging-related
conditions and treatment-related toxicities adversely affect their quality of life (QoL) and survival, d) their
interpersonal emotional processes and social determinants influence discretionary utilization (e.g.,
chemotherapy) at the end of life (i.e., DIALs), and e) serious illness conversations and advance care planning
with SN members promote appropriate use of palliative care. In this proposal, we focus on three behaviors
known to improve outcomes at the end of life (EoL): initiating and participating in serious illness conversations
about preferences for EoL care, completing advance care planning, and engaging with palliative care. We will
examine how structural characteristics of patients’ SNs (e.g., density; size and composition of inner circle),
their functional aspects for provision of social support, and the quality of relationships (perceptions of
belonging, interpersonal emotional processes) influence these health behaviors. We will also examine SN
resilience: how SNs evolve to continue to provide support for patient behaviors in the face of cancer
progression and network disruptions. We will assess interactions among structure, function, and quality of
relationships of SNs using Mixed Methods Social Network Analysis (MMSNA) to integrate structural analysis
with qualitative assessment of network characteristics, and evaluate associations with health behaviors at the
EoL. At study entry, we will survey 300 patients with advanced cancer (age >65 years, with a life expectancy
<12 months) to assess their SN structures. Then, we will use criterion-based emergent sampling to purposively
select up to 70 patients and one key influential member of their SNs for in-depth semi-structured interviews to
characterize how SN members influence health behaviors of older patients with advanced cancer at the EoL.
Our aims are (1) To assess the interrelationships between SN structure, function, and quality of relationships;
(2) To analyze how SN structure, function, and quality of relationships relate to key health behaviors, including
engagement in serious illness conversations about EoL preferences, advance care planning, and palliative
care; and (3) To describe thematic pathways of network resilience (i.e, how the structure, function, quality of
relationships evolve) in response to cancer progression and SN stressors over 6 months. Our findings will help
develop SN interventions, informed by and adapted to network structures and interpersonal processes of
behavior change, to improve EoL care in older patients with advanced cancer."

This renewal application continues to focus on older people with insulin resistance (IR) and aims to understand
the mechanisms of exercise benefits. The original grant focused on the mechanisms of resistance exercise
training (RT) related enhancement of peripheral (muscle) insulin sensitivity (IS) and muscle hypertrophy. The
premise of the current proposal is built on substantial preliminary data obtained with a supplement to our current
grant which was focused on the effect of RT on brain metabolism and cognition. We will address the neuronal
benefits of six months of either high-intensity aerobic interval training (HIIT) or RT in 60–85-year-old people with
IR compared to sedentary controls (n=24 per group). We hypothesize that enhancement of IS in response to six
months of HIIT or RT will improve cognition, measured by NIH Toolbox, concurrent to enhanced brain regional
connectivity, measured by resting-state functional MRI, and greater glucose uptake in brain regions rich in insulin
receptors, measured by PET scanning (F-18 FDG). We also will determine whether HIIT and RT increase cortical
and hippocampal volumes measured by volumetric MRI. Although exercise benefits in central neuronal
regulation are postulated, based mostly on pre-clinical experimental data, the benefits of exercise training on
brain metabolism and cognition remains incompletely defined in humans. Furthermore, in addition to our
postulation that exercise training enhances neuronal connections within the brain, we also propose that exercise
can enhance neuronal connection between the brain and skeletal muscle. We will utilize transcranial magnetic
stimulation combined with electromyography (TMS-EMG) to test a hypothesis that RT and HIIT increase
neuronal connections from the central nervous system to muscle, as indicated by lower threshold of cortical
stimulation needed to activate muscle, prior to structural and morphological changes accompanying long-term
exercise training. We will compare TMS-EMG data at baseline, 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after the
initiation of exercise training with changes in muscle mass, histology, and metabolites. The results from these
studies will determine if there are central neural adaptations to exercise training that drive muscle mass and
strength changes. To ensure the successful completion of the study, we have assembled a group of highly
experienced investigators with strong collaborative track records. The results from the proposed studies are
likely to substantially advance our understanding of exercise benefits to neuronal and cognitive function in people
with IR, who are at 2- to 4-fold greater risk for developing dementia compared to people without IR. We submit
that these results can potentially form the basis of targeted exercise therapies and lay the groundwork for
developing novel therapeutic approaches benefitting people who are unable to perform exercise training."

Nutrient absorption in the neonatal mammalian gut relies on intracellular digestion by a population of enterocytes
known as vacuolated or neonatal enterocytes. Recently, we showed these cells are conserved between
zebrafish and mammals and are specialized in the uptake and digestion of dietary proteins. As these cells
possess a prominent lysosomal vacuole and are present in non-mammalian vertebrates such as fish, we refer
to them as Lysosome Rich Enterocytes (LREs). In our previous studies, we found that protein uptake in zebrafish
and mouse LREs is mediated by a scavenger receptor complex composed of cubilin (Cubn), its transmembrane
partner amnionless (Amn), and the endocytic adaptor Dab2. However, the cellular mechanisms that allow LREs
to internalize cargo from the intestinal lumen at an astounding rate are unknown. Here, we will leverage the
experimental advantages of the zebrafish system and the conserved biology of LREs to investigate the endocytic
machinery that allows these cells to support dietary protein absorption in the intestine. Specifically, we will
elucidate the mechanisms regulating a specialized form of clathrin mediated endocytosis that confers LREs a
high capacity for luminal protein uptake."
10992856,"Pneumocystis pneumonia remains the number one cause of fungal pneumonia in infancy and is
a common infection in immunocompromised individuals. Research in the field has been
hampered by the inability to culture this fungus leading to a delay in obtaining

well as a lack of in vitro antibiotic susceptibility. When placed in media, Pneumocystis murina
dies within hours. However we have preliminary data that with P. murina is placed in culture
lung tissue form precision cut lung slices (PCLS) that both the troph and ascus can survive up to
14 days. Moreover, we have observed evidence of fungal biofilms in this model. Additional
preliminary data shows that this model can be used for in vitro antibiotic susceptibility. Thus the
goal of this proposal is to refine this model and test submerged versus air liquid interface model
to optimize fungal attachment, survival, and growth. Additionally we will investigate if this model
can be used for antibiotic susceptibility testing with both folate metabolism antagonists as well
as echinocandins. Furthermore, we will investigate of this model can be used to assess
macrophage mediated killing as well as the role of both mannan and β-glucan recognition
receptors in this process."

This proposal, IMMEA (Integrative Models of Metabolites, Equol and Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease),
aims to (1) determine the association of equol-producing status with ASCVD (atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease) and (2) build models of ASCVD from equol, marine omega-3 fatty acids (OM3), metabolites, and
other factors using Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs). To achieve these goals, we will leverage the
unique datasets from two case-control studies of ASCVD nested within the Tsuruoka Metabolomics Cohort
Study (TMCS) and the Tohoku Medical Megabank Project (TMMP) in Japan. ASCVD mortality in Japan is less
than half of that in the US despite a worse profile of lifetime exposure to many traditional risk factors in Japan.
It has decreased continuously for the past five decades despite a noticeable rise in total cholesterol. Studies of
migrant Japanese to the US showed a dramatic increase in ASCVD rates, indicating that the low ASCVD
mortality is not due to genetic susceptibility but environmental exposure specific to Japan. Diet is a major
environmental determinant of ASCVD. The Japanese diet stands out due to its high soy isoflavones (SIFs) and
OM3 consumption. While studies in Japan show that SIFs are cardioprotective, a randomized clinical trial
(RCT) of SIFs in the US failed to show their benefit. We posit that this discrepancy is due to equol producing
capability. Equol, a metabolite of SIFs, exhibits the most potent anti-atherosclerotic properties among all SIFs.
In Japan, 40-70% of individuals produce equol after SIF consumption, while RCTs of SIFs in the US reported
equol production rates of 20-30%. No previous study has examined the association of equol with ASCVD in
Japan. We and others show a significant inverse association of dietary intake of OM3 with ASCVD rates in
Japan. Underlying mechanisms linking high dietary intake of OM3 and ASCVD are not fully understood.
Metabolomics has emerged as a tool to decipher biological mechanisms. Metabolomics studies of ASCVD
typically rely on statistically independent tests, neglecting higher-order dependencies among variables. PGMs
provide a flexible framework for modeling extensive collections of variables with complex interactions, yet
PGMs have not been applied to integrative metabolomics analyses in ASCVD. To bridge these critical gaps,
IMMEA will conduct two case-control studies of 1,200 subjects nested within each TMCS and TMMP.
Completing this study has the potential to provide profound insight into the biological mechanisms underlying
the benefits of the Japanese diet, with implications for the prevention of ASCVD in the US."

In the past decade, restoring the intrinsic axon growth ability of mature neurons has received promising results
in promoting axon regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS). However, to date, axon regeneration that
leads to successful functional recovery in the CNS is still practically impossible, primarily due to the inadequate
distance of regeneration and the low number of regenerating axons. Previous studies and my preliminary data
have shown that many genes mediating the intrinsic axon growth ability are differentially expressed at different
developmental stages in neurons, indicating the altered gene expression level during neuronal maturation is an
important factor underlying the diminished intrinsic axon growth capacity. However, how the altered gene
expression program is regulated remains largely unknown. Transcription factors (TFs) play important roles during
neuronal development, shaping the spatiotemporal gene expression landscape to control cellular activities
including axon elongation. Thus, understanding the intricate transcriptional regulatory network orchestrating
axon growth during development is critical for solving the challenge of mammalian CNS axon regeneration. In
this proposed study, I will perform parallel RNA-seq and ATAC-seq of purified retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) at
multiple developmental time points, and use advanced integrative bioinformatics analysis to obtain a
comprehensive view of the transcriptional regulatory network controlling the axon elongation function during
RGC development, and identify key TFs that function as core regulators of axon growth. The identified TFs will
be functionally tested in mouse optic nerve regeneration model to verify if they play important roles in RGC axon
regeneration and cell survival. RGCs are comprised of more than forty molecular distinct subtypes. Different
RGC subtypes vary in vulnerability to axonal injury and have distinct responses toward gene modulations. I will
conduct single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) in RGCs 2 weeks after optic nerve crush from control and TF-
manipulated groups to acquire the frequency of each RGC subtype in the final population, and determine what
specific RGC subtypes are protected by the manipulation of a specific TF by comparing the frequencies of RGC
subtypes between control and TF-manipulated groups. TFs whose manipulations are found to improve survival
in distinct RGC subtypes will be combined in the next step to determine if simultaneously manipulating these
TFs could protect a wide variety of RGC subtypes from injury-induced cell death and induce synergistic
promoting effect on RGC axon regeneration. In addition, I will also combine the manipulations of these TFs with
non-muscle myosin IIA/B deletion in RGCs, which produces axon regeneration by modifying cytoskeletal
dynamics in the growth cone of injured axons, to find out if this combinatory approach could lead to
unprecedented long-distance axon regeneration."

 There is a critical socioeconomic and medical need for anabolic therapies capable of replacing lost bone
mass in diseases such as osteoporosis. Humans and mice with striking high bone mass (HBM) can aid in the
identification of novel mechanisms to promote osteoanabolism. Notable examples include activating mutations
in the Wnt co-receptor Lrp5 and individuals with sclerosteosis (decreased SOST expression).
 We have found that deletion of Vhl in osteocytes but not osteoblasts (Dmp1-cre;Vhlf/f) produces a robust
skeletal phenotype, characterized by dramatic increases in both cortical and trabecular microarchitecture
compared to age-matched wild-type mice. Vhl targets hypoxia inducible factor-alpha (HIF-a) subunits for
ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation under normoxic conditions, and is considered a
master regulator of HIF activity. In contrast to previous work deleting Hif1a in osteoblasts, we do not observe a
reciprocal, low bone mass phenotype in osteocytes lacking Hif1a. Our data suggest that osteocytes may only
require HIF-2a to transduce Vhl signaling, presenting new possibilities to identify and exploit yet-unknown
pathways in osteocytes, that could be harnessed to improve bone health.
 It is not that surprising that osteoblasts and osteocytes might use different signaling machinery to
transduce a particular signal, as a multitude of genes undergo upregulation or downregulation during the
osteoblast-to-osteocyte transition. Increasing evidence shows that while HIF-1a and HIF-2a are both
expressed in bone cells, their stability is differentially regulated, and they induce transcription of distinct gene
targets. While much attention has focused on the role of HIF-1a in bone, very little is known about HIF-2a.
 Our long-term goal is to elucidate HIF-a isoform contribution to skeletal development, HIF-a isoform
functional redundancy, integration with Wnt/b-catenin signaling, and if manipulation of Vhl/HIF-a expression
prevents ovariectomy (OVX)-induced bone loss. Our overall hypothesis is that osteocytes require HIF-2a,
rather than HIF-1a, to mediate effects on the skeleton. Within, we will evaluate the fundamental requirement of
OCY HIF-2a in longitudinal bone growth, as well as HIF-a isoform specificity to recapitulate and maintain the
Vhl cKO HBM phenotype (Aim 1), the epistatic relationship of b-catenin in the HBM phenotype of Vhl cKO
mice (Aim 2), and the utility of targeting HIF-a for improving bone properties in an OVX mouse model (Aim 3).
 These studies will define the role of HIF-a-dependent functions of Vhl in osteocytes that drive acquisition of
HBM. Understanding these signaling pathways may allow identification of novel therapeutic targets leading to
bone accrual and reversing the osteoporosis that accompanies aging and menopause. Doing so will alleviate
the costs and associated quality of life issues that result in the inevitable fractures that are so common, without
the associated complications that accompany current therapy."

Early-stage heart failure (HF), defined broadly as asymptomatic structural heart disease, is a growing public
health concern and has been receiving greater attention in clinical settings. Early-stage HF is a risk factor for
advanced HF, but there is heterogeneity in this risk. While there are known biomarkers and biological
mechanisms of advanced HF, little is known about the potential entity of early-stage HF that is distinct from
underlying HF risk factors. Additionally, individual -omics platforms have been applied to discover novel biology
and biomarkers of advanced HF, but multi-omics data integration methods have not yet been applied in this
space. Through preliminary analyses, I have discovered novel proteins for early-stage HF that are distinct from
underlying risk factors and advanced HF. With these initial results, I hypothesize that molecular features of
cardiac inflammation are significant biomarkers for early-stage HF, and that we can optimize biomarker and
biological mechanism discovery by applying integrative -omics techniques. The broad objective of this proposal
is to discover novel biomarkers and biological mechanisms underpinning early-stage HF that have prognostic
capabilities for advanced HF. Understanding how early-stage HF is distinct from underlying risk factors and
advanced HF at a molecular and clinical level could enable the development of novel diagnostic tests and
preemptive treatment measures to forestall adverse late-stage outcomes. I propose to accomplish this by
utilizing state-of-the-art machine learning methodologies for the analysis of multi-omics and clinical data from
large-scale population cohorts. First, I will develop and validate an automated computable phenotype for the
identification of early-stage HF using clinical data and imaging-derived measures of cardiac structure and
function. I will then apply this computable phenotype in the UK Biobank to identify significant protein and
metabolite features of predicted early-stage HF cases using separate single-omics analyses. After identifying
candidate biomarkers, I will assess their causality and biological relevance by performing Mendelian
Randomization and pathway enrichment analysis. To test the impact of data integration on model predictive
ability, I will apply a modified version of MiNet, an interpretable pathway-associated deep neural network for
diseas prediction. Using MiNet, I will integrate proteomics and metabolomics data to predict Stage B HF cases
versus Stage A HF controls and compare the neural network’s performance to those from the single-omics
models. From the trained deep learning model, I will compare pathway node activation in the neural network to
the single-omics pathway analysis results to assess whether multi-omics integration affects the richness of
biological findings from a model. With this work, I will improve knowledge of early-stage heart failure
biomarkers and biology; I will also expand upon the application of evolving machine learning strategies for
integrating multi-modal data in the context of complex disease."

The goal of this R01 proposal is to adapt and pilot an intervention to reduce individual-level intersectional
HIV/AIDS and drug use stigma and increase retention in HIV care among women living with HIV and who use
drugs (HIV+ WWUD) in Ukraine. The scientific evidence is consistent across populations and settings that
stigma is associated with poor health outcomes. HIV stigma is associated with poor HIV medication
adherence; worse health outcomes, lower health care utilization, and low self-reported health status, low HIV
medication adherence, and diminished mental health. Drug use stigma is associated with poorer access to
health care, suboptimal engagement in HIV care, increased injection risk behaviors, and decreased use of
harm reduction and medical services. HIV+ WWUD experience worse health outcomes than other women
living with HIV. Intersectional stigma refers to the recognition that people may belong to multiple stigmatized
groups and that focusing on a single dimension of disadvantage (e.g., only HIV or only drug use) obscures how
these multiple identities interact and are compounded to produce specific health outcomes or statuses. Despite
the known impact of intersectional stigma on HIV care outcomes and advancements in HIV stigma reduction
strategies, few interventions have been developed, implemented, and tested to specifically address
intersectional HIV and drug use stigma among women to improve HIV care outcomes. We will adapt a small
group, multi-session intervention to train participants in cognitive and behavioral skills to improve adaptive
coping and reduce internalized and anticipated HIV and drug use stigma, develop communication skills to
respond to enacted stigma and enlist social support, and address structural barriers to ART The Specific Aims
of this study are: 1) To adapt the Workshop intervention for HIV+ WWUD using the ADAPT-ITT model; 2) To
assess the preliminary efficacy of the adapted intervention on primary clinical outcomes of HIV care
engagement and ART adherence and secondary outcome of drug treatment engagement; and 3) To assess
acceptability, feasibility, cost, and implementation-related processes and outcomes of the intervention. We will
enroll n=100 HIV+ WWUD who will be randomized to the intervention or control arm. To assess HIV outcomes,
participants will complete baseline and 3- and 6-month post intervention assessments to measure HIV care
engagement outcomes and changes in stigma mechanisms. We will also obtain medical records to validate
HIV care engagement and ART medication adherence. The proposed intervention is novel in that it addresses
intersectional stigma and seeks to intervene on specific stigma mechanisms that lead to worse HIV and other
health outcomes for HIV+ WWUD. This pilot study will increase understanding of the intervention and
contextual factors that will facilitate a larger RCT to determine the effectiveness of the intervention for HIV+
WWUD."

Dr. Elinor Lee is a Pulmonary and Critical Care physician who is greatly interested in the role of lipid metabolism
in surfactant homeostasis and pulmonary diseases. Dr. Lee is focused on mechanistic studies exploring the
paradigm-shifting hypothesis that lipid dysregulation contributes to the pathogenesis of pulmonary alveolar
proteinosis (PAP). Her long-term goal is to establish an independent research program as a physician scientist
in the field of lipid biology and PAP and eventually, other pulmonary diseases. She is supported by her primary
mentor, Dr. Tarling, a leader in lipid biology and inflammation, as well as her co-mentors and advisors who will
provide their multidisciplinary expertise in training Dr. Lee in the theoretical and technical aspects of lipid
metabolism and immunology. Through UCLA’s Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI), Dr. Lee will
have access to numerous career development seminars that address such topics as grant writing, manuscript
preparation, and ethical research. She will also take graduate courses to obtain further training in gene editing,
immunology, lipid metabolism, and biostatistics. Dr. Lee has the full support of her institution to carry out her
research.
This proposal outlines a 5-year research and career development plan that will prepare Dr. Lee to become an
independent physician-scientist engaged in cutting-edge scientific research. This project aims to elucidate the
mechanisms by which loss of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signaling impairs
clearance of surfactant in alveolar macrophages. Dr. Lee’s prior work suggests that reduced expression of GM-
CSF-dependent ABCG1, an intracellular cholesterol transporter that requires ATP to function, may drive
reductions in cholesterol export by alveolar macrophages. Recent evidence, however, also suggests that
reduced ATP production caused by impaired GM-CSF-dependent fatty acid catabolism may contribute to
reduced phospholipid catabolism and/or cholesterol clearance. In Specific Aim 1, Dr. Lee will define the temporal
sequence and kinetics of lipid abnormalities caused by loss of GM-CSF stimulation in vivo with a novel, inducible
mouse model to identify the primary, pathogenic lipid abnormality and the secondary changes. Further, she will
evaluate whether reducing cholesterol content in alveolar macrophages will restore their function to demonstrate
that cholesterol accumulation due to impaired cholesterol clearance is the primary pathologic defect driving
alveolar macrophage dysfunction seen in PAP. Aim 2 will focus on determining the mechanism of the primary
and secondary lipid abnormalities caused by impaired GM-CSF signaling. Improved understanding of the
relationship between loss of GM-CSF signaling and lipid dysregulation leading to surfactant accumulation will be
crucial to the development of effective, innovative therapeutic strategies for patients with PAP and enhancing
the fundamental knowledge of alveolar macrophages."

 Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder affecting over 10
million people worldwide and contributes to over $52 billion yearly in US healthcare costs. Despite investigation
into mechanisms of α-synuclein (aSyn) misfolding and aggregation leading to neuronal dysfunction and death,
the inciting events of the hallmark of PD pathology in humans are not understood. The systemic manifestations
of PD have led to the discovery of αsyn pathology in multiple peripheral tissues, including plasma.
Understanding the origin of peripheral aSyn pathology is critical to advancing the understanding of PD and to
developing early disease-modifying therapies.
 In preliminary work, antibodies generated against in vitro strains of aSyn are detectable at higher levels
in individuals with PD (iwPD), reliably discriminating them from individuals with Dementia with Lewy bodies,
when no other differentiating biomarkers exists Furthermore, one of these aSyn strains is elevated in plasma
from iwPD who have a reduced rate of cognitive decline. These strains are not reliably detected in
cerebrospinal fluid and do not correlate with levels of strain-specific aSyn found in white or red blood cells
implicating an alternative peripheral tissue source. The goals of this proposal are 1) to use extracellular
vesicles, membrane-bound structures secreted by cells, to identify the tissue source of plasma aSyn strains in
an unbiased manner and 2) determine the functional and pathogenic properties of plasma aSyn strains in
biochemical assays and a cellular model of PD. In line with the mission of the NINDS, this work has the
potential to improve understanding of fundamental mechanisms of PD pathogenesis and to lead to
development of treatments that reduce PD morbidity.

Few safe and effective pharmacotherapies exist for alcohol misuse. Alcohol consumption directly effects the
gut microbiome, altering its diversity and leading to increased bacterial overgrowth. Chronic drinking leads to
microbial dysbiosis, intestinal permeability (“leaky gut”) and changes in immune responses. These microbiome
changes have been associated with other neuropsychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and depression,
frequently associated alcohol misuse symptomology. A growing number of clinical and pre-clinical studies have
provided remarkable promise using fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) as a safe, effective therapy for reducing
ethanol drinking and liver disease. Our own collaborative efforts have recently shown that FMT improved
drinking behavior in humans with cirrhosis, and this was transmissible to germ-free mice through alterations in
the gut immune-inflammatory response. Since fecal transplant of microbiota from patients with AUD can
change the intestinal barrier and affect brain function, we hypothesize that gut microbiota enriched in beneficial
bacteria can reduce ethanol drinking and related anxiety-like behaviors. Dietary fiber may further enhance this
effect by increasing microbial engraftment or length of its effect. This innovative mPI proposal brings together
the specific expertise of human clinical laboratories experienced in using therapeutic FMT and a rodent
behavioral pharmacology laboratory to understand the specific characteristics of gut microbiota needed to
reduce ethanol intake and preference. In Aim 1, we will assess the effects of microbiota transplant into
recipient mice from human donor with varying amounts of Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae on ethanol
drinking, FMT engraftment and anxiety-like behavior. Four human donor samples will be assessed which differ
in the amount Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the role of dietary fiber on
microbiome engraftment and its ability to further reduce ethanol drinking in mice. These innovative studies are
an important first step in understanding the mechanisms through which gut microbiota can positively affect the
gut-brain-axis to reduce ethanol drinking and related phenotypes. These studies will establish a pre-clinical
model of therapeutic FMT where we can begin to test the specific mechanisms of these drinking reductions."

Ovarian hormones such as estradiol and progesterone are increasingly implicated in the sex-specific etiology
of neurological disorders. Conditions like Alzheimer’s disease, for instance, are more than twice as likely to
arise in women compared to men, with accumulating evidence pointing to a depletion of circulating hormones
across the menopause transition as a critical risk factor. However, the mechanisms underlying steroid hormone
modulation of neural circuits remain unclear. The estrous cycle offers an ideal window into the sex-dependent
mechanisms underlying neurological disorders, as structural and functional plasticity are tightly coupled with
naturally cycling levels of steroid hormones. In this project, we will use 2-photon microscopy, viral gene editing,
and computational analysis of neural and behavioral data to assess the effect of the estrous cycle on sensory
and spatial representations. Our preliminary data indicate that pyramidal neurons in hippocampus exhibit
elevated dendritic spine density and greater place field remapping during high-estradiol stages of the estrous
cycle. In the F99 phase of this proposal I will establish the molecular mechanisms underlying hormonal
changes in spatial coding by using CRISPR/Cas9 to target specific receptors. In the K00 phase I will elucidate
how hippocampal circuits are modulated by sensory perception across the estrous cycle, and how this
influences ethological behaviors. To accomplish this, I will first track dendritic spine turnover as a function of
estrous cycle stage and identify the specific endocrine receptors responsible for driving estrous-dependent
changes in spine turnover (Aim 1.1). Using two-photon microscopy, I will measure dendritic spine turnover in
hippocampal region CA1 and use viral gene editing to knock down targeted hormone receptors in a subset of
CA1 neurons. Dendritic spine turnover will be evaluated between wild-type and knockdown cells. Second, I will
record the functional responses of place cells across the estrous cycle as they remap between environments
(Aim 1.2). Targeted receptor knockdowns will be used to determine the mechanistic role of endocrine
receptors in shaping the flexibility of spatial representations. In the K00 phase, I will take the skills and insights
gained from the F99 phase and use them to investigate the role of the estrous cycle in modulating ethological
behavior (Aim 2). I will leverage unsupervised machine learning to evaluate a caching behavior dependent on
the hippocampal-olfactory circuit, while recording the activity of olfactory bulb neurons that project to CA1 by
way of entorhinal cortex. Chemogenetic silencing of these projections will be used to uncover the mechanism
underlying behavioral and circuit-level changes across the estrous cycle. Ultimately, the proposed work will
represent a significant advance in our understanding of the modulatory role of steroid hormones in cognition,
and facilitate the development of individualized sex-dependent treatments for neurological disorders."

The intersection of Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) and Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) presents a significant public
health challenge, particularly in clinical settings where their co-occurrence complicates treatment outcomes and
exacerbates the severity of each disorder. Despite advancements in pharmacotherapy for OUD and AUD
independently, the treatment of these co-occurring disorders remains underexplored, especially in large-scale,
real-world contexts. Our research aims to address this gap by leveraging the Oracle Cerner EHR Real-World
Data (CRWD), a comprehensive national database encompassing over 100 million patients, to conduct an
extensive analysis of treatment patterns, outcomes, and predictive factors in patients with co-occurring OUD and
AUD. Our study is structured around three specific aims. The first aim is to assess the effectiveness of integrated
treatment approaches, including first-line AUD and OUD medications along with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor
agonists (GLP-1 RA), for patients with co-occurring OUD and AUD. We will focus on evaluating the reduction in
substance use, improvements in physical health indicators, mental health improvements, and the utilization of
detoxification services and drug tests. We hypothesize that patients receiving integrated treatment regimens will
exhibit better outcomes, such as lower rates of alcohol intoxication and opioid overdose, improved liver function,
reduced hospitalization, and alleviated mental health symptoms. The second aim is to identify demographic,
racial, and clinical factors that predict adherence to treatment regimens in patients with co-occurring OUD and
AUD. We will examine the consistency of medication orders, the duration and dosage consistency of prescribed
treatments, and the alignment of medication orders with clinical appointments. Our hypothesis is that specific
demographic and clinical characteristics will significantly influence treatment adherence, with variations
observed across different patient groups. The third aim is to investigate the impact of stable and consistent
comprehensive treatment engagement on long-term recovery outcomes in individuals with co-occurring OUD
and AUD. We will measure relapse rates and durations of abstinence, hypothesizing that patients who
demonstrate stable and consistent engagement in their treatment process will exhibit lower relapse rates and
longer durations of abstinence. This research is innovative in its approach to leveraging a national database to
address the complexities of co-occurring OUD and AUD. It is particularly innovative in exploring GLP-1 RA as a
potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of these co-occurring disorders. By integrating this novel approach
with traditional pharmacotherapies and evaluating its effectiveness using a large-scale national database, this
study aims to contribute significantly to addiction medicine. The findings have the potential to inform clinical
practice and public health policy, leading to more effective and personalized treatment strategies for individuals
affected by these disorders. Ultimately, this research will provide empirical evidence to guide the development
of new clinical guidelines or updates to existing procedures and policies in treating co-occurring OUD and AUD."

Psychiatric disorders are the leading cause of disabilities worldwide, and cost over $300B in the U.S alone.
Despite the rise in psychiatric medication prescriptions, approximately 30% of patients are treatment resistant.
Clinical trials indicate that psilocybin elicits rapid and sustained outcomes for mood and substance use disorders,
sparking interest in the therapeutic potential of psychedelics. These effects are believed to be dependent on the
serotonin-2A receptor subtype. However, serotonin exerts potent vasoactive effects, which becomes particularly
relevant when employing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the influence of psychedelics
on neurophysiology. fMRI indirectly indexes neuronal activity via blood-oxygen-dependent signals which depend
on neurovascular coupling (NVC). If NVC is altered, hemodynamic measures of brain activity may inaccurately
reflect neuronal activity. Accurate assessment of the neurophysiological effects of psychedelics requires
simultaneous mapping of neuronal and hemodynamic activity. That psychedelics alter brain structure and
function is supported by molecular evidence demonstrating altered synaptic plasticity. Further, psychedelics can
reactivate social critical periods in adult mice in a manner that aligns with the length of human-reported acute
subjective effects (intoxication). These observations imply that psychedelics having longer versus shorter
intoxication duration may differentially affect neuroplasticity. However, the potential for psychedelics to reopen
critical periods beyond social reward circuitry is unknown, as is the impact of psychedelic duration on these
processes. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that psychedelics give rise to differential reports of neuronal
versus hemodynamic measures of neurophysiology and sensitize neuroplasticity in an intoxication-duration-
dependent manner. I have been testing this hypothesis during my PhD research using wide-field optical imaging
in awake mice under the influence of the psychedelic 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI). My preliminary
results (Aim 1a) reveal that DOI significantly alters NVC, and that calcium (neuronal) and hemodynamic signaling
differentially report how DOI alters brain network organization. For the remainder of my PhD, I will determine
whether short- versus long-duration psychedelics differentially affect neurophysiology (Aims 1b, F99 Phase). For
my postdoctoral research, I will determine whether psilocybin and DMT affect neuroplasticity in the visual system
(Aim 2, K00 Phase). Specifically, I will test the hypothesis that psychedelics accelerate functional brain
reorganization induced by monocular deprivation in a psychedelic intoxication-duration manner. Results from the
proposed experiments will establish network-level neuronal signatures of psychedelics and determine whether
psychedelics broadly enhance neuroplasticity. To guide my training, I have assembled an interdisciplinary team
of mentors and collaborators at Washington University in St. Louis with diverse, complementary expertise. The
outlined research and training plan will allow me to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent
investigator designing novel treatment strategies for patients resistant to existing psychiatric therapies."

Limited data are available on the effects of antenatal opioid exposure on the brain and neurodevelopment.
Most studies are limited by methodologic flaws in study design, including small sample sizes and difficulty
controlling for important environmental variables. The OBOE (Outcomes of Babies with Opioid Exposure)
study, an ongoing NICHD-funded longitudinal study enrolling infants with and without antenatal opioid
exposure at birth and following them to 2 years of age, attempts to improve on the limitations of previous
research by collecting comprehensive exposure data including infant umbilical cords, advanced neuroimaging
data to evaluate brain development, and standardized and thorough information on the home environment,
maternal mental health, and parenting. The OBOE consortium, comprised of 4 highly performing centers, a
data coordinating center, and a neuroimaging core, has completed our goal enrollment of 200 opioid-exposed
and 100 unexposed infants. In response to RFA-HD-24-014, we now propose to complete follow-up to age two
in our OBOE cohort, to fulfill our main study objectives. The Cincinnati site has contributed to the OBOE
study by enrolling 149 infants (94 exposed and 55 controls), completing 233 MRIs thus far, and
contributing to the publication of multiple abstracts and three manuscripts using OBOE data. For this
renewal grant, we will continue progress toward our aims to: 1) determine the impact of antenatal opioid
exposure on brain structure and connectivity over the first two years of life; 2) define medical, developmental,
and behavioral trajectories over the first two years of life in exposed infants; and 3) determine how the home
environment, maternal mental health, and parenting modify trajectories of brain connectivity and
neurodevelopment over the first two years of life. Our progress so far, with enrollment completed and success
in following this difficult population, shows that we have the ability to successfully complete the objectives of
the OBOE study."

Nanopore-based sequencing has numerous advantages over sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS, the current gold
standard for accuracy), including its ability to detect genomic variations (on a single molecule basis) and provide
long-read, wider genomic contexts, and scaffolds. Additionally, the low cost and simple instrumentation mean
that nanopore sequencing can enable accessible and routine clinical cancer screening in the future as
comprehensive, disease-specific assays are developed. However, in order to supplant SBS, nanopore-based
sequencing techniques must see improvements in methodology to increase accuracy, and this is particularly
true for genomic repeats, which represent significant but under-studied regions of the genome. In fact, repetitive
DNA sequences comprise almost 50% of the human genome but are still quite challenging to characterize
because it is impossible confidently align/order small fragments of the repeat; DNA repeats need to be read
continuously and completely (end-to-end). SBS technology specifically is limited by a combination of sequence
bias, and polymerase/synthesis error or failure that accumulates during the sequencing process and ultimately
limit the technique to short read lengths. Thus, because the most accurate sequencing method on the market
(SBS) cannot sequence these regions, their roles in disease progression are largely unknown. However,
evidence to date shows DNA repeats have a remarkable quantity of sequence variation(s) for normal vs.
diseased cells, and as a function of disease progression. Further, these disease-correlated variations have also
been found to indicate therapy success. Unfortunately, the methods used for these studies are primarily
academic in nature, relying on complex, qualitative methods that do not transfer to clinical settings. To bridge
this technology gap, Dr. Eric Peterson will lead Electronic BioSciences, Inc. (EBS), nanopore technology experts,
in developing a novel approach to nanopore-controlled sequencing that will yield state-of-the-art accuracy and
read lengths capable of assessing DNA repeats. During this program, EBS will demonstrate functionality of the
approach and fully assess the workflow/methodology, including accuracy, against current, standard approaches.
To initially characterize the feasibility and practicality of the proposed approach, EBS will also show the ability to
multiplex the measurement itself on a small scale, which will position the technology for extensive multiplexing
during a follow-on effort, a critical consideration for commercial adoptability. The capability to sequence repetitive
sequences with high accuracy and precision, and to identify their variations, will signify a major advancement in
cancer genomics, paving the way for improved diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutics, which will lead to
better outcomes in cancer care."

Intimate partner violence (IPV) increases the risk of traumatic brain injury (TBI), because the physical assaults
target the head, neck, and face. Women, more than men, across socioeconomic, racial, educational, regional,
and other demographic variables are in harm’s way throughout their life and particularly during pregnancy. When
one partner is pregnant, the frequency and intensity of physical assaults increase and remain focused on the
head, neck, and face. Whether from IPV, falls, or automobile accidents, the consequences of a TBI during
pregnancy (gravida TBI; gTBI) on offspring neuro-development are unknown. Isolated TBI elevates stress and
inflammation, which are known to divert fetal neuro-development with gestational exposure. The proposal goal
is to provide proof-of-concept that gTBI can disturb neurodevelopment, thereby establishing gTBI as an
environmental risk factor for developmental disorders. These studies cannot be performed in people or be
derived from existing databases, thereby warranting laboratory studies. Preliminary data from this research team
showed live births, low male weaning weight, distorted cortical circuity, reduced anxiety and depression, and a
muted immune response principally in male gTBI offspring. These results encourage further investigation of TBI
timing with respect to pregnancy, broader assessment of neuropsychiatric outcomes, enhanced neural circuit
analyses, and molecular investigations of cell and synaptic change. The extent of neurodevelopment disruption
is compared to a standard model of maternal immune activation (MIA) and respective controls. The central
hypothesis of this proposal is that TBI during pregnancy leads to disrupted neurodevelopmental trajectory in the
offspring that includes altered neurobehavioral performance, neurocircuit organization, and cell type-specific
molecular disturbances. To test this hypothesis, a diffuse TBI will be delivered to timed- pregnant mice at 5 and
12 days post-coitum and then follow male and female offspring in terms of: [Aim 1] birth outcomes, offspring
physiology, neurobehavioral phenotype; [Aim 2] neurocircuitry phenotype, and [Aim 3] synaptic protein
expression and cortical cell type-specific gene expression (transcriptomics). Aim 1 will evaluate early post-natal
behaviors; cognition, anxiety, depressive-like, and sensorimotor gating in young adult; and social behaviors in
adult offspring. In Aim 2, cortical and hippocampal synaptic physiology and cortical connectivity will be evaluated
by electrophysiology and laser scanning photostimulation, and aligned with quantitative neuronal morphology.
In Aim 3, western blot quantification of synaptic proteins and cell type-specific transcriptomics inform circuit
development and molecular trajectories. Impact: Successful completion of the proposed studies will provide the
first proof-of-concept that consequences of TBI during pregnancy, often resulting from IPV, can distort
developing brain circuity and determine a neurodevelopmental disorder behavioral phenotype."

We have previously shown that metformin, a biguanide commonly used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, has
robust protective effects against cigarette smoke (CS)- induced lung pathologies including accelerated aging,
apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress in mice and in individuals with emphysema-dominant COPD.
Alveolar epithelial cell injury contributes to structural damage in emphysema with alveolar type 2 epithelial (AT2)
cells crucial in promoting lung re-epithelization and maintenance of surfactant synthesis after such injuries. AT2
cells are the most metabolically active cells of the alveoli and use fatty acid oxidation (FAO, which occurs mainly
in mitochondria) as fuel. We here show that AT2 cells are the main target of metformin’s protective effects against
CS-induced lung damage, by reducing AT2 oxidative stress burden and improving AT2 FAO and mitochondrial
function. In this proposal, we will test the central hypothesis that metformin protects AT2 cells against CS-induced
dysfunction and emphysema by ameliorating dysfunctional AT2 cell mitochondrial metabolism and FAO. We will
also prove that, by improving FAO in AT2 cells, metformin rescues mitochondria from CS-induced dysfunction. To
test these hypotheses, we will pursue complementary Specific Aims. Aim #1 will test the hypothesis that
metformin improves AT2 function in a CS-induced emphysema model by partial binding of mitochondrial complex
1 (MTC) of the electron transport chain. Using CS-exposed mice lacking a functional MTC1 subunit, and +
metformin, we will analyze the effects of metformin on AT2 cell function by assessing mitochondrial function/stress,
and AT2 surfactant synthesis and regenerative functional capacity. In Aim #2, will test the hypothesis that
metformin improves AT2 function in a CS-induced emphysema model by restoring FAO improving lipid metabolism
and mitochondrial function in AT2 cells. Using CS-exposed mice lacking CPT1A, a key enzyme in FAO, and +
metformin, we will determine the protective effects of metformin on AT2 cell surfactant synthesis and regenerative
functional capacity by assessing lipid metabolism, FAO oxidation and mitochondrial function/stress. In Aim #3, we
will use fresh lung samples from individuals with COPD and controls recruited prospectively to confirm our
preclinical finding that metformin protects the lung against CS and COPD pathologies by ameliorating AT2 cell
FAO and mitochondrial impairment and thus AT2 cell function. Simultaneously, using fresh and frozen blood from
samples from the same patients and from well-characterized existing COPD patients’ cohorts, we will also
investigate the circulating lipidomic profile associated with the use of metformin as a marker of metformin efficacy
in a selected subset of COPD patients. The characterization of the effects of metformin on FAO in a preclinical
emphysema model, and in patients with emphysema will pave the way to new strategies targeting a selected
category of patients that could benefit from metformin treatment."

Traumatic spinal cord injury is a devastating condition that affect about 302,000 people in the United States, with
18,000 new cases each year. The limited ability of axons to regenerate after injury in the adult central nervous
system (CNS) underlies the permanent functional deficits and paralysis experienced by people with spinal cord
injury. Much research remains to be done to fully understand how regeneration is controlled by molecular and
cellular machinery in the neurons. This proposal builds on our recent success of applying Patch-based single
cell RNA sequencing technology to interrogate the molecular mechanism of corticospinal axon regeneration after
spinal cord injury. By sequencing only hundreds of neurons but at unusually high depths, we developed a
regeneration classifier that can be broadly applied to predict the regenerative potential of diverse neuronal types
based on their single cell profiles, the first of its kind in regenerative biology. Furthermore, this study implicates
key components in mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant response in regulating regeneration. Here we
propose to expand Patch-seq based single cell RNA sequencing approach in several ways. First, we will refine
and extend the regeneration classifier by sequencing additional corticospinal neurons and other neuronal types
with different regenerative capabilities. This will allow us to develop a more accurate regeneration classifier and
understand its full range of capabilities and limitations. Second, we will investigate the role of antioxidant
response and mitochondrial biogenesis with a comprehensive array of genetic gain and loss of function analyses
on NFE2L2 and PPARGC1A, master regulators of the two biological processes and two top candidates from our
Patch-seq study. Third, we will conduct deep sequencing on young versus old neurons to understand the age
impact on axon regeneration, which would be required to develop therapies that are robust across age groups.
Together, the proposed experiments using this unique deep single cell RNA sequencing approach will bring a
greater understanding of the neuron intrinsic control of axon regeneration, providing the foundation for
therapeutic development to promote repair and recovery after spinal cord injury."

2022 with an exciting and forward-thinking program featuring a focus on mechanistic studies of the microbiome
through cutting-edge basic and translational research and new developments in the role of the microbiome in
infectious disease, clinical science, and personalized medicine. Our goal is to establish this conference as a
biennial event open to nation-wide attendance yet focused on bringing together the microbiome research and
clinical communities from the “Rust Belt” region including Pittsburgh (University of Pittsburgh, University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center [UPMC], Carnegie Mellon, Duquesne, Allegheny General Hospital, as well as
Allegheny College, Carlow University, and Chatham University) and nearby cities (including Buffalo,
Morgantown, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Cincinnati, and Columbus). The conference will be open to national
attendance, while promoting inclusion of undergraduate and regional institutions and hospital staff who may
otherwise have limited access to national/international conferences on human pathogens and the microbiome.
While research in the microbiome space is presented at other national meetings, the RBM conference
distinguishes itself in multiple ways including research topics focused on new technologies that can be
incorporated into microbiome studies, understanding the challenges and successes of incorporating the
microbiome in translational and clinical settings, and the importance of evolution and adaptation processes in
host-microbiome interactions of adults and infants. Further, the conference emphasizes the integration of basic
and clinical researchers, along with highlighting the work of students and junior investigators. To this end, the
conference will feature several “rapid-fire” sessions for short talks from junior investigators chosen by the
organizing committee from submitted abstracts. There will also be opportunities for students to present their work
in an interactive poster session in which posters are grouped by topics and students orally present posters to
their peers and senior investigators knowledgeable of the subject area. Opportunities for students to interact with
speakers will also be organized. As a part of RBM 2024, we are also growing a workshop (piloted in the 2022
conference) for undergraduates and graduate students on scientific communication to the wider public which will
include the involvement of expert faculty in public communication of science and technology from the University
of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University and Duquesne University. The conference brings together leading
scientists from multiple disciplines and institutions to advance this vital field while striving for an inclusive meeting
that actively involves and promotes students and junior scientists."

 Sexually reproducing animals perform innate sexually dimorphic behaviors that are important for their
reproductive success. Sex differentiation of the brain and behavior is established through the action of master
regulators that work downstream of sex determination factors. In mammals, nuclear hormone receptors fill this
role; in insects, neural sex differentiation is mediated by the male-specific transcription factor Fruitless (FruM).
The importance of these master regulators in sexual differentiation of the brain and behavior is well established.
However, how a subset of neurons become specified for their expression and function is poorly understood. To
explore this, we use the Drosophila melanogaster as a model. In both sexes, fruitless is transcribed in a subset
of neurons that wire together into sexually differentiated circuits regulating social behaviors. However, FruM
protein is only translated in the male. Most D. melanogaster central brain neurons are born from progenitor cells
that produce neurons in a pair-wise fashion, producing two distinct hemilineages. Diverse fruitless neurons are
contained in at least 60 different hemilineages that make up the D. melanogaster central brain along with sister
cells that do not express fruitless. This suggests that hemilineage identity is an important factor for the
specification of fruitless transcription and for the impact of Fruitless protein. Using scRNA-seq to study fruitless
expressing neurons in the context of their neuronal hemilineages, I identified the nuclear receptor dissatisfaction
as being enriched in the entire hemilineage that contains the fruitless-expressing mAL neurons (Medially located,
just above Antennal Lobe), including sister neurons that do not express fruitless. Interestingly, dissatisfaction
has previously been shown to be important for sex-specific behaviors and my preliminary data also shows it is
important for the overall development of this hemilineage. Here, we will test how Dissatisfaction impacts
development of this hemilineage and how this sex-shared factor impacts the sex differentiation process in circuits
which control social behaviors. The work proposed in this application will elucidate how a neuron’s lineage origin
interacts with the sex differentiation process to specify its circuit function during development.

11005130,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Positive parenting practices (e.g., supportive, consistent, responsive) buffer the negative effects of early
adverse experiences by developing safe, stable, and nurturing environments. Positive parenting practices are
important in strengthening and creating positive childhood and supporting optimal child social and behavioral
development. Parent training (PT) is the gold standard for supporting and strengthening parenting practices
and preventing and treating child behavior problems. The primary method of delivering PT involves face-to-
face, in-person sessions. Although effective, there are multiple limitations with in person PT delivery affecting
access and reach (time; schedule conflicts; access to childcare, transportation, trained facilitators; stigma). The
PT program proposed in this study is the web-based adaptation of the evidence-based based Chicago Parent
Program (CPP), called ezParent. There is evidence suggesting web-based programs are more effective when
paired with human support, known as hybrid delivery. The overall purpose of this STTR fast-track project is to
develop and test tools to support implementation of hybrid ezParent using a community organization dedicated
to serving low-income families and young children (Head Start and Early Head Start (HS/EHS)) as a test site.
The proposed ezParent implementation bundle (ezParent program for parents, asynchronous web-based
facilitator training, and the ezParent dashboard) will be refined and usability tested in Phase I and parent, child,
and implementation outcomes evaluated in a cluster randomized trial in Phase II. In Phase I and in
collaboration with a Community Advisory Board (CAB) of HS/EHS stakeholders, specific metrics, components,
and features to include in the dashboard will be developed with the goal to enable robust tracking of program
use and support program tailoring. Then, in partnership with the CPP/ezParent developers, a 2-module
prototype of the hybrid facilitator training will be developed and evaluated by trained parent training facilitators.
In Phase II, the 4-module facilitator training and the ezParent bundle website with custom views for parents,
facilitators, and administrators will be completed. The ezParent bundle will be tested using a cluster
randomized trial in 16 HS/EHS sites (8 ezParent bundle/8 usual care) with HS/EHS personnel facilitators
(n=16-32; ~2 facilitators/8 intervention sites) and 516 parents (258/arm) of children aged 2-5 years old. The
ezParent bundle implementation outcomes will be examined from the site, facilitator, and parent levels using
RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness of implementation, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance). This study
addresses the NICHD STTR priority of developing and adapting technologies and products that support
healthy social and behavioral development and targeting underserved populations."

Michigan State University in conjunction with the Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(MIOSHA) and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services has been conducting state-based
occupational injury and illness surveillance since 1988. This proposal will continue and expand this activity.
This proposal will fund activity to generate the occupational indicators, data on elevated blood leads, and
specific non-fatal injuries (e.g. burns), ten special projects and expanded surveillance programs for: (1)
occupational lung disease; (2) acute work-related pesticide injuries and illness; (3) acute work-related acute
traumatic fatalities. Since initiation of multi-source surveillance, cases of work-related asthma, cases of acute
pesticide poisoning, cases of silicosis and other lung diseases, elevated blood lead levels, and both acute
fatal and non-fatal traumatic injuries have been confirmed. This case-based surveillance has initiated follow-
back enforcement MIOSHA inspections in the worksites. These inspections have included interviews of
fellow workers. The confirmation process, workplace inspections and fellow worker interviews will be
continued. There has been 100% reporting from the 134 acute care hospitals in the state. A quarterly
newsletter (four/year for 31 years) has been written and mailed out to approximately 3,300-targeted
physicians and health care professionals. Two hundred and three annual reports and 51 hazard alerts have
been disseminated. The above active outreach to encourage reporting and educate employers and
employees about hazards will be continued as will presentations and display booths at medical meetings,
publishing papers in the medical literature, postings on our website (oem.msu.edu), Twitter, and Facebook,
the NIOSH Science Blog and through the medical licensing board. We will continue to work with NIOSH,
CSTE, other states, trade organizations and unions. Evaluation of the effectiveness of our effort to improve
working conditions will also continue. Innovations in this application including expanding our educational
outreach, and ensuring that we address the hazards of vulnerable populations and minorities, as well as
temporary workers and youth follow back. New activity planned includes expanding surveillance to include
exposure surveillance, additional nonfatal traumatic injuries, projects on under-reporting, evaluation of
MIOSHA inspections for following up reported cases and projects on special populations and industrial
sectors."

 The human reference pangenome, which represents a collection of genome sequences in a single data
structure, has the potential to transform human genetics applications. Compared to a traditional linear
reference genome, pangenomes enable analysis of megabases of genetic sequence that were previously
ignored, reduce bias when analyzing diverse genomes, and provide dramatically improved genotyping of
structurally complex regions of the genome. These complex regions likely harbor medically relevant variants
contributing to a range of human traits. However, pangenomes have yet to be integrated into medical genetics
and complex trait workflows due to a lack of analysis and visualization tools that are accessible to non-experts.
 Our central hypothesis is that pangenomes can be used to improve fine-mapping of trait associations
and detection of pathogenic variants in complex regions by identifying particular paths enriched in individuals
with a phenotype of interest. We focus on developing and applying tools that leverage pangenomes to identify,
visualize, and fine-map genomic loci associated with complex traits. The tools proposed below are motivated
by two major challenges identified by our own efforts to this end. First, visualization and browsing pangenome
subgraphs for loci of interest, which is a critical step in exploring and understanding complex genomic regions,
is currently a cumbersome and time-consuming process involving multiple command line tools geared at
bioinformatics experts. Second, there is a lack of tools for integrating existing biobank datasets for which both
genotype and phenotype data are available for complex traits analysis, with the reference pangenome.
 Our proposal integrates multiple large datasets encompassing a range of technologies and builds on
existing pangenome resources and the computational infrastructure developed by the HPRC. In particular, we
use genotype data and whole genome sequencing (WGS) datasets available for hundreds of thousands of
individuals of a range of ancestries from the UKBiobank and All of Us as well as thousands of phenotypes
available for these samples. A key goal is to enable backwards compatibility with existing biobank-scale
datasets that have been mapped to linear reference genomes, which will facilitate more immediate use of the
pangenome reference. We additionally use near complete long read assemblies and the reference
pangenomes (primarily minigraph-cactus) released by HPRC. Further, our tools are designed to integrate with
the current pangenome computational ecosystem by incorporating existing file formats (e.g. rGFA) and toolkits
(e.g. vg). To this end we will develop a web-based pangenome browser that integrates with existing data based
on linear genomes (Aim 1), develop metrics to quantify local graph complexity and use these metrics to
characterize existing GWAS signals (Aim 2), and integrate pangenomes with existing biobank datasets to
perform fine-mapping and visualization of individual trait-associated loci (Aim 3)."
10977574,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The National Youth Tobacco Survey showed the prevalence of e-cigarette use among high school students has
skyrocketed from 12% in 2017 to 28% in 2019 and remains high at 14.1% in 2022. While different regulatory
policies (such as the FDA e-cigarette flavor enforcement and Tobacco 21) are currently in place trying to alleviate
this vaping epidemic among youth and young adults, there is an urgent need to effectively communicate with the
public about the risks of e-cigarette use and nicotine addiction. However, how to engage the public with the e-
cigarette prevention messages is particularly challenging. Social media platforms such as Twitter/X, Instagram,
TikTok, and YouTube are very popular in the United States, especially among youth and young adults. Previous
studies have found that social media platforms are widely used to promote e-cigarette products by vape shops
and companies but are under-used by public health authorities for educating the community about the health
risks of e-cigarette use. Social media marketing of e-cigarettes as healthier alternatives to conventional
cigarettes resulted in the common perception among youth that vaping is a harmless activity. Social media
exposure to e-cigarette-related content could affect e-cigarette use (vaping) behavior, with vaping promotion
content leading to more vaping and vaping prevention content leading to reduced vaping. Therefore, social media
provides a rich and natural data resource about vaping-related messages in different formats (text, image, and
video). The purpose of the proposed study is to identify key features of e-cigarette-related social media
(Twitter/X, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube) posts (especially vaping prevention posts) associated with high
social media user engagement (such as the number of likes) by applying advanced artificial intelligence and
statistical modeling techniques, and further validate them using the combination of an online survey study and a
semi-structured interview study. To achieve our goal, we will characterize key features of Twitter/X posts (tweets)
related to e-cigarettes associated with high social media user engagement, such as the number of retweets and
favorites, using natural language processing, machine learning, and statistical modeling techniques (Aim 1). We
will characterize key features of e-cigarette-related Instagram posts associated with high social media user
engagement through deep-learning algorithms and statistical models (Aim 2). We will characterize key features
of e-cigarette-related TikTok and YouTube videos with high social media user engagement using artificial
intelligence techniques (Aim 3). We will validate the key features selected from social media posts through a
cross-sectional anonymous online survey study and a semi-structured interview study (Aim 4). Results from the
proposed study will provide valuable guidance in designing effective vaping prevention messages for future
public health campaigns to help with the effective communication of risks associated with e-cigarette use, which
will help prevent the initiation and counter-uptake of e-cigarettes by youth and young adults."
10977720,"Project Summary: The current proposal, developed in response to RFA-AG-24-031 (Consortium for
Economic Research on AD/ADRD Prevention, Treatment, and Care) will leverage the last 15 years of
Medicare claims and clinical assessment data and econometric methods to advance our understanding of how
post-acute and long-term care use and health outcomes for persons living with ADRD are impacted by the
changing landscape of health care financing. The 6.7 million Americans living with ADRD are the most frequent
users of long-term care services. Unfortunately, the current long-term care system is characterized by
substantial barriers to access, variation in service quality, and potentially inefficient resource allocation across
community-based and institutional care settings. In nursing homes, the predominant institutional long-term care
setting, persons with ADRD often experience adverse care outcomes such as falls, avoidable hospitalization,
and excessive psychotropic medication use. Although home- and community-based care services (HCBS) are
an increasingly used alternative to institutional long-term care, the efficacy of HCBS for individuals with ADRD
is unclear and many barriers to accessing HCBS remain poorly understood. A signature feature of the long-
term care system is its reliance on post-acute care and more broadly, the involvement of multiple payers.
However, our understanding of recent significant changes to the Medicare and Medicaid financing landscape
on post-acute and long-term care utilization and outcomes is limited. Aim 1 of this proposal focuses on the
changing use of nursing home and home health services among persons with ADRD in the context of states’
expansion of HCBS funding and constraints on provider supply from certificate of need laws. Aim 2 focuses on
the evolution of MA in long-term nursing home care, a largely ignored area despite the explosive growth of the
MA program. This Aim also includes an evaluation of a potential promise of MA in long-term care: the
institutional special needs plans model. Aim 3 focuses on changes to a post-acute care revenue stream on the
quality of post-acute and long-term nursing home care. Post-acute care spending has been a consistent target
for saving Medicare dollars despite the importance of these funds for nursing home quality. Our study takes
advantage of federal policy that reduced cost-sharing revenues for nursing homes, but in application affected
nursing homes differently based on whether their state Medicaid programs had ‘lesser-of’ payment rules.
Completion of this entire project will be a significant contribution given the projected increase in the number of
people living with ADRD whose health outcomes may be sensitive to these financing and supply-side policies.
In addition, all project Aims include analyses that are focused on disparities in care utilization and outcomes by
race/ethnicity or Medicaid enrollment. Our results may inform future policy efforts to enhance and coordinate
the funding and delivery of post-acute and long-term care services to the ADRD population, which ultimately
may improve outcomes and enhance equity."

Streptococcus mutans resides in the oral cavity where it is known to initiate the development of dental caries.
For this pathogen to thrive in the dynamic and variable environment of the mouth, S. mutans must be able to
adapt to both short- and long-term ecological pressures. The horizontal acquisition of new DNA, which may
encode for new beneficial traits, is a critical aspect of S. mutans adaptability. In addition, regulation of the
processes involved in the acquisition of DNA are intertwined with the basic physiology and stress responses of
S. mutans. Mobile genetic elements often mediate HGT and include integrative and conjugative elements
(ICEs), widespread among oral bacteria. ICEs are mobile elements that are integrated on the genome and
possess the ability to excise and subsequently transfer to nearby bacteria via conjugation. Importantly, these
elements often contain “cargo” genes that provide some benefit to the host bacterial cells (including antibiotic
resistance, metabolism, and virulence). In recent work supported by R03 DE029882 and F32 DE032551, we
undertook the first characterization of TnSmu1 as a model of HGT within this critical oral pathogen. We
discovered that TnSmu1 is a functional ICE, capable of transfer. Further, we have made significant progress
investigating a regulatory system that controls activation of TnSmu1 and showed that TnSmu1 causes a host
cell defect in cell division. Further, when TnSmu1 excision is induced, the S. mutans Type I-C CRISPR-Cas
system is up-regulated, for reasons that are currently unclear but possibly suggesting an interaction between
TnSmu1 and this bacterial defense mechanism. Together, this indicates TnSmu1 shares a complex
relationship with its host bacterial cell.
 Despite the prevalence of ICEs in oral bacteria and the significant impact of TnSmu1 on host cell
physiology, detailed studies of their molecular mechanisms and their impact on oral communities are lacking.
To address this, we propose to use TnSmu1 as a model of conjugal transfer in the following Specific Aims:
Aim 1: Dissect the regulatory mechanisms that control the switch from the integrated to excised state of
TnSmu1. Aim 2: Elucidating interactions of TnSmu1, mobile genetic elements, and CRISPR-Cas defense in
bacterial hosts. Aim 3: Investigating the fitness cost(s) of TnSmu1 acquisition on recipient strains. Taken
together, these studies will provide a wealth of information for an understudied mechanism of gene transfer in
the oral microbiome. Elucidating mechanisms of gene transfer is critical for understanding of S. mutans
adaptability and the ability to combat oral disease. At the conclusion of these studies, this work will have
created a new understanding of HGT, evolution, and pathogenesis of S. mutans within the oral microbiome."

Aneuploidy—the presence of chromosome gains and losses—is very rare in normal tissues but occurs in more
than 80% of human tumors, especially in solid tumors. A high level of aneuploidy in tumors correlates with higher-
grade disease, tumor progression, and resistance to therapy. Whether and how aneuploidy contributes to
formation and progression of human tumors is not well understood. Whereas genomic and clinical studies in
cancer patients suggest that aneuploidy drives tumorigenesis, experimental studies in mouse models and in vitro
systems has so far yielded conflicting data on the role of aneuploidy in tumors. Human tumors are often
specifically associated with either increases or decreases in the number of specific chromosome(s). One of the
main obstacles to progress has been the technical limitation of not being able to engineer the ‘right’ type of
aneuploidy in the ‘right’ cell type.
 Our ultimate goal is to dissect whether and how aneuploidy contributes to initiation and progression or
human tumors. Our first objective here is to generate cellular models that faithfully recapitulate the aneuploidy
patterns found in tumors in order to study how aneuploidy affects the pathobiology of tumor cells (their ability to
grow in vitro or in vivo, to evade cell death pathways, to survive cellular stress and to regulate transcription and
translation). Our second objective is to uncover vulnerabilities and synthetic lethal interactions potentially
associated with the aneuploid state. The outcomes of the proposed project will represent the foundation to
achieve the long-term goal of our lab, which is to develop a better understanding of the causes and
consequences of aneuploidy in human tumors in order to uncover aneuploidy-associated biomarkers and
therapeutic targets.
 To accomplish this goal, we will first use a panel of newly generated human cells containing different
degrees and types of aneuploidy to compare diploid and aneuploid cells for several tumor-related cellular
phenotypes both in vitro and in vivo. Secondly, we will adopt a systematic approach to identify genes and
pathways that when blocked, inhibit proliferation and survival of aneuploid tumor cells but not normal cells. Third,
we will perform a protein and phospho-protein analysis mainly of colorectal tumor patients’ samples to dissect
the consequences of aneuploidy at the level of protein stability and pathway regulation. Our results will fill an
important gap of knowledge in our current understanding of how aneuploidy evolves during tumorigenesis and
how we might take advantage of this knowledge to improve patient outcomes."

plan to use funds from this Program Announcement to expand and improve our current
occupational health surveillance programs. Recognizing that many occupational hazards and
adverse health outcomes overlap other public health programs, we will continue to incorporate
our data into other public health tracking systems and will explore potential opportunities to get
industry and occupation variables included in their infectious disease surveillance databases.
We will evaluate data to identify high-risk industries and occupations and populations at high-
risk and direct our prevention strategies towards these populations. The integration of
occupational health into public health practice has the additional benefit of being able to assist
with dissemination of information. We will continue to collect, review, follow up and monitor adult
blood lead data, which can be used for worksite investigations and intervention activities, and
continue our collaboration with the NYS Childhood Lead Prevention Program to ensure prompt
identification of lead poisoned pregnant women and follow-up of their newborn babies.
BOHIP proposes to continue our surveillance efforts of all occupational lung diseases while
focusing and enhancing our surveillance of work-related asthma. To do this, we will translate
past successes into the development and implementation of occupational prevention,
intervention, and outreach activities. We also propose to continue our work on the Fatality
Assessment and Control Evaluation (FACE) project. The goal of the FACE project is to reduce
the occurrence of work-related non-fatal and fatal injuries by establishing a strong workplace
safety culture through changing the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of individuals within the
NYS working community. We will target fatal injuries among self-employed workers, older
workers (>65 years of age), Hispanic or Latino workers, agricultural workers, and construction
workers."
10992534,"Dry eye disease (DED) is a chronic condition affecting millions worldwide, with approximately 21 million
patients affected in the US. Symptoms of DED vary from mild irritation to severe ocular pain, and, if left untreated,
can lead to the loss of vision. The pathogenesis of DED is a subject of intense research efforts, but its etiology
is still unknown. It can be classified as evaporative dry eye (which includes Meibomian Gland Dysfunction [MGD])
and aqueous-tear-deficient DED (which includes lacrimal gland deficiencies, such as Sjögren Syndrome [SS]).
Meibomian glands (MGs) secrete lipids (meibum) onto the ocular surface to stabilize the tear film. Changes in
MG function (MGD) lead to altered quality and quantity of meibum, causing increased tear film evaporation, and
leading to evaporative DED. Clinical studies suggest that 85% of all DED cases are caused by some form of
MGD. Despite the high prevalence of MGD, its etiology has not been fully investigated. SS is an autoimmune
DED characterized by over-reactive CD4+T cell-mediated inflammatory response in various tissues. Studies
have demonstrated that a high prevalence of SS patients present MGD. However, the pathobiology of MGD in
SS patients remains unknown. Our innovative hypothesis is that SS patients also present an autoimmune
response in the MG that leads to an autoimmune form of MGD. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary
studies showing that CD25KO mice, a mouse model of SS rich in autoreactive T cells and no regulatory T cells
(Tregs), present CD4+T cell infiltration in the MG area, which is associated with MG atrophy and drop-out.
Further, the co-adoptive transfer of CD4+T cells from CD25KO mice into immune-deficient mice leads to immune
cell infiltration into the MG, causing MGD. Interestingly, the co-adoptive transfer of wild-type Tregs with CD4+T
cells from CD25KO mice is enough to prevent immune cell infiltration in the MG and MGD. Based on this
preliminary data, we hypothesize that autoreactive CD4+T cell infiltration into the MG area drives MG damage,
causing MGD. Taken together, this proposal will characterize the inflammatory cell infiltration into the MG area
in two well-established murine models of SS, and thereafter establish how autoimmune CD4+T cells are able to
lead to MG damage, causing an autoimmune form of MGD. This will be accomplished with the following specific
aims: Specific Aim 1: To characterize the MG inflammatory cell infiltration in the MG of CD25KO mice and
how it contributes to MGD; and Specific Aim 2: Investigate if autoimmune CD4+ T cells can cause MGD
and whether this can be prevented by Tregs. Currently, the etiology of MGD remains elusive, and, thus, it is
difficult to design preventative therapies and treatments. Understanding and characterizing a potential role for
inflammation (particularly CD4+T cell) in MGD will open new research avenues for developing new treatments.
This work is significant because it will develop and characterize for the first time an autoimmune model of MGD
which will shed light on the etiology of MGD, a great public health problem that affects millions of people."

microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation influences critical molecular pathways involved in tumor
progression in a wide range of cancer types. Therefore, modulating miRNA levels in cancer cells as a
novel therapeutic approach has promising potential in cancer treatment. In our parent NCI project, we
proposed to develop a nanoparticle formulation of miRNA-216a as an early intervention for pancreatic
cancer. Specifically, we aim to engineer pancreas-targeting nanoparticles to restore the miRNA-216a
level at the pancreas at the early stage of pancreatic cancer development. To achieve this goal, we
combine in vitro and in vivo screening to identify formulations that can efficiently delivery RNAs to
pancreas. Although thousands of nanoformulations of nucleic acids have been synthesized and have
shown good in vitro transfection, excellent in vitro delivery efficiency often fails to translate in vivo. To
address this challenge, we propose to adopt a novel high throughput in vivo screening approach to
simultaneously measure the tumor delivery efficiency of a library of barcoded nanoformulations of
miRNA. Our central hypothesis is that in vivo high throughput screening of barcoded nanoparticles
can lead to the identification of formulations that selectively deliver miRNAs to the tumor. As
nanoparticle in vitro screening results often yield poor predictions for their in vivo delivery efficiency,
the results of this study will have the potential to uncover the underlying mechanism of poor in vitro-in
in vivo correlation, leading to a better understanding of nanoparticle in vivo targeting behaviors."
10994004,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Immunotherapies hold immense promise to provide cures for many cancers and metastatic disease, but only
benefit a fraction of patients. Tumors can still engage multiple mechanisms to avoid and escape anti-tumor
immune responses, including suppression, inactivation, and exclusion of potential cytotoxic T cells, processes
which collaborate with cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). A better understanding of these barriers has
led to a multitude of new immunomodulatory targets to be developed, some to be used in combination with
e.g., checkpoint blockade or CAR T cells. On the other hand, dominant barriers to immunotherapy can be
different among patients with the same cancer type, and thus there is a need for personalized approaches to
immunotherapy, so that the appropriate targets are used. Here we develop a novel organotypic culture devices
to maintain ex vivo cultures of primary tumors and an immune component (tumor-draining lymph nodes or
circulating leukocytes), on a platform that enables precise control over spatial, molecular, cellular, and
mechanical characteristics and that is relatively high-throughput to allow screening or large numbers of
experimental variables. In preliminary data, we show that these devices mirror key features of in vivo
responses to immunotherapy, such as improved tumor cell killing and increased markers of immunotoxicity
(possible adverse events) in response to cytokine immunotherapy. We propose that these devices can be used
both to screen for ideal immunotherapy combinations as well as to probe the basic mechanisms underlying the
deficiencies in the anti-tumor immune response for tumors exhibiting varying levels of immune infiltration,
neoantigen load, and baseline lymphatic densities. In this way, we can begin to build a stratification map that
aligns key morphological features of individual tumors to treatment regimes that are most likely to lead to
efficacy and tumor regression. Using a combination of both murine mouse models and primary patient-derived
biospecimens, we will take advantage of the level of control afforded by our novel organotypic devices to
mechanistically interrogate individual immune cell subsets and signaling axes, towards understanding their
roles in influencing the course and outcomes of anti-tumor immune responses."

Intercellular communication between tumor cells and stromal cells of which major components are
fibroblasts play a significant role in tumor growth, cancer progression and metastasis. This proposal
aims to investigate the role of STAT2 signaling in the exchange of communication between colorectal
cancer (CRC) cells and stromal cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumor microenvironment.
Our preliminary show that a clinical correlation between high STAT2 expression and poor survival as
well as a positive correlation between STAT2 and markers of CAFs. Analysis of tumor biopsies of CRC
patients showed elevated STAT2 protein in the tumor and surrounding stroma. Studies in two animal
models of CRC reveal that STAT2 is tumorigenic. RNA-Seq analysis exposed a transcriptional signature
associated with tumor associated fibroblasts. Furthermore, we found that STAT2 facilitates the
proliferation and invasion of tumor cells. In parallel, we found that induction of EGF expression in normal
fibroblasts was poorly induced after incubation with conditioned medium from STAT2 deficient tumor
cells. Given these observations, we postulate that STAT2 mediates the crosstalk between the
tumor and CAFs leading to CRC disease progression. The objective is to: (1) Determine whether
intrinsic tumor STAT2 signaling leads to reprogramming of normal fibroblasts to CAFs to promote tumor
growth and (2) Determine whether STAT2 signaling in normal fibroblasts leads to their conversion to
CAFs to enhance tumor growth. Completion of this study will reveal the importance of STAT2 signaling
in the tumor microenvironment as the communication axis (unidirectional vs. bidirectional) between
tumor cells and CAFs to enhance tumor growth, migration, and invasion.
Significance: Treatment of advanced CRC by combining targeted therapies with chemotherapy has
produced modest success. Delineating the oncogenic role of STAT2 signaling in the tumor
microenvironment may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. If results from our study
reveal that STAT2 plays a dynamic role in the establishment of cell-to-cell communication in the tumor
microenvironment, our findings will support a rationale to inhibit STAT2 signaling as a therapeutic
intervention for the treatment of metastatic CRC."

Inhibitors of the mTOR pathway are among the most promising interventions to target age-related
dysfunction, however, there is a critical need to further define the pro longevity effects to facilitate clinical
development of mTOR inhibitors. The current proposal will significantly advance this effort providing new
targets for intervention and novel markers to monitor individual responses to mTOR inhibition. The
overarching goal of this research program is to develop a mechanistic understanding of novel downstream
targets of rapamycin, in order to facilitate safer and more effective strategies to promote healthy aging.
Cellular senescence occurs in both somatic and stem cell populations and contributes to age-related
dysfunction, and our laboratory has shown that mTOR inhibition using rapamycin, can prevent entry into the
senescent state. The mTOR pathway also regulates senescence and pluripotency in a variety of stem cell
populations. The central hypothesis of the application is that mTOR inhibition by rapamycin prevents
senescence and enhances pluripotency by increasing the lncRNA H19. The rationale for this hypothesis is
our observation that rapamycin increases levels of the non- coding RNA (lncRNA) H19. We find that levels of
H19 decrease during senescence and in pluripotent cells. H19 plays a central role during development and
differentiation, and maintenance of adult stem cell populations. Rapamycin increases H19 levels, prevents
senescence and maintains pluripotency. The results suggest that increasing H19 levels in response to
mTOR inhibition may play a dual role, inhibiting senescence while simultaneously increasing pluripotency in
adult stem cell populations. The proposed work will provide transformative data regarding a novel
mechanism for lifespan extension and improvement of late-life function in multiple tissues."

Most bacteria are found in complex microbial communities, where social interactions between community
members shape community function and behavior. One of the mechanisms by which bacteria regulate these
interactions is through quorum sensing, a type of cell-cell signaling that regulates behaviors in a population
density-dependent manner. Quorum sensing contributes to pathogenesis of many plant and animal pathogens
and for this reason has been the target of efforts to develop novel antivirulence therapeutics. Previously, studies
of quorum sensing, including infection models, have been primarily carried out using clonal populations. Results
of those studies have been useful to elucidate the molecular biology of quorum sensing but provide a limited
understanding the role of quorum sensing in more complex communities such as those from the environment
and infections. Direct studies of naturally occurring mixed microbial communities present many challenges. A
combination of new technologies in genomics and genetics and the development of laboratory models or
`synthetic ecology' approaches have advanced progress on studies of non-clonal bacterial populations. The PI
has developed laboratory models to study quorum sensing in mixed-strain and mixed-species populations to
define how quorum sensing promotes survival in these communities. A major result of these studies is that
quorum sensing increases resistance to antibiotics and that this regulation alters the dynamics of competition
among and between strains of soil bacteria. Quorum sensing also regulates antibiotic resistance in the
opportunistic pathogen P. aeruginosa, and this regulation could be important in the face of antibiotic therapy
during infections. The studies in this proposal will build on these preliminary results and use laboratory models
and clinical infection isolates to study quorum-sensing control of antibiotic resistance. The studies will provide a
mechanistic understanding of quorum-regulated antibiotic resistance, define how quorum-sensing systems
adapt under selection by antibiotics, and determine how quorum sensing alters resistance phenotypes among
individual members of a population. The results will provide a more complete picture of how quorum sensing
alters population dynamics in complex communities and in patient infections. This information is needed to
develop novel disease treatment strategies that rely on manipulating the quorum-sensing systems of pathogens.
The results will have implications in the field of quorum sensing, for understanding social behavior in a broader
sense, and finally, for understanding how social behaviors can be targeted for effective treatment of polymicrobial
infections."
10993893,"Myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading cause of death in the United States, affecting over 800,000 people
annually. Numerous protein therapies have been developed to treat MI, but effective delivery of therapeutics to
the heart remains a formidable challenge. Systemic, intravenous (IV) delivery of therapeutics results in low tissue
specificity and rapid loss of function, necessitating high dosing, repeated administration, and/or long treatment
periods. Direct injection of therapeutics into the myocardium commonly results in rapid clearance due to the
heart’s contractility. To be successful as therapies for MI, protein drugs need new delivery methods that allow
localized delivery in a sustained, controlled manner with minimal cargo loss. Here, I propose the development of
injectable liposome nanoparticle crosslinked (LINC) hydrogels designed for sustained protein therapeutic
delivery in the myocardium. These hydrogels are formed by crosslinking hyaluronic acid (HA) with functionalized
liposomes, forming HA-LINC hydrogels, through strong yet reversible dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) bonds.
The Heilshorn Group has shown that HA-based hydrogels crosslinked through DCCs are injectable, retained in
the myocardium, and cyto-compatible. To evaluate their performance in a preclinical setting, I will use HA-LINC
hydrogels to deliver the promising MI protein therapy neuregulin-1β (NRG1) in a rat model of MI. In Aim 1, I will
synthesize a library of distinct HA-LINC hydrogels by tuning liposome functionalization, HA functionalization, and
HA concentration. The resulting gels will be analyzed for viscoelasticity, in vitro hand injectability using a syringe
pump, and toxicity when cultured with primary cardiomyocytes. In Aim 2, I will systematically tune the degree of
liposome internal stabilization and evaluate the effects on liposome structure, hydrogel viscoelasticity, and cargo
release rates. To determine the bioactivity of released NRG1, it will be delivered from HA-LINC hydrogels to
primary cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocytes will be examined for viability, proliferation, and morphology in a
hypoxia challenge representing MI. Additionally, I will evaluate the ability of released NRG1 to rescue the
phenotype of hydrogen peroxide-treated cardiac fibroblasts. In Aim 3, the HA-LINC formulation with the highest
stiffness and lowest required injection force (Aim 1) and most sustained NRG1 release profile (Aim 2) will be
evaluated in vivo. Following induction of MI through ligation of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, HA-
LINC hydrogels encapsulating NRG1 will be injected. NRG1 plasma concentration over time will be used to
create a pharmacokinetic model of release. I will evaluate effects on cardiac function, tissue remodeling, gel
retention, cardiomyocyte survival, and angiogenesis. The proposed HA-LINC hydrogels will provide localized,
long-lasting, controllable protein delivery to treat MI. This work will be completed in the Heilshorn lab at Stanford
University in collaboration with Profs. Wu and Appel, experts in cardiology and pharmacokinetics. I will be directly
mentored by Prof. Heilshorn and my collaborators, take courses on drug delivery, cardiac regenerative medicine,
and bioethics, and continue mentoring undergraduates in the lab."

Maternal mortality is a pressing global issue, especially impacting vulnerable populations. Intimate partner
violence (IPV) is a widespread problem that significantly intersects with maternal health, leading to adverse
outcomes and an increased risk of maternal mortality. Homicide, often committed by intimate partners, is the
primary cause of death during pregnancy, with the highest risk among Black and adolescent populations.
Despite its importance, addressing IPV in maternal mortality research remains an underdeveloped aspect of
public health research. This R25 grant proposal seeks to bridge this gap by developing a comprehensive
research education program to equip maternal health researchers with the essential skills to effectively
measure and address IPV in their research. Our program will be developed following the ADDIE (Analyze,
Design, Develop, Implement, and Evaluate) Model of Instructional Design and is organized into three distinct
aims. In Aim 1, we will build upon our prior work to develop a webinar-based curriculum focused on four core
areas essential for effective measurement of IPV in maternal health research: (1) understanding the scope and
impact of IPV, (2) IPV measurement characteristics and tools, (3) analysis and interpretation of IPV data, and
(4) cultural safety in maternal health and IPV research. We will also develop an online resource toolkit with
webinar recordings, IPV measurement tools, sample protocols, and ethical guidelines. Aim 2 will involve
implementation of the research education program in an online synchronous format, delivered through two
webinars lasting 2 hours each. We will offer the education program four times during the 2-year grant period,
with the first offering serving as a pilot. We aim to enroll 10-12 participants in the pilot and 20-25 in each
subsequent offering. We will extend the reach of our curriculum through the dissemination of our online
resource toolkit, ensuring wide access and sustainability beyond the funding period. Aim 3 will involve a
comprehensive evaluation of feedback obtained from our Advisory Board, comprised of experts and
stakeholders (formative evaluation); the implementation of proposed activities (process evaluation), and the
overall effectiveness of the activities in achieving the aims of the training program (outcome evaluation). The
outcome evaluation will be guided by Kirkpatrick’s Four Levels of Training Evaluation to assess participants’
satisfaction, learning, behavior, and results. By evaluating the program's impact and refining it accordingly, the
team aims to strengthen the program's efficacy over time, ensuring that it remains relevant and effective in
addressing IPV in maternal health research and supporting the needs of researchers in the field. Empowering
maternal health researchers with these tools will enhance their capacity to generate translatable evidence-
based solutions, thus strengthening the ability of health professionals to provide comprehensive care and,
ultimately, contribute to the reduction of maternal mortality and IPV among vulnerable populations."

With advancements in operative techniques and perioperative management, there is an increasing number of
patients with single ventricle congenital heart disease (SV) that are surviving into childhood and beyond. Due
to the chronic pressure and volume load placed on the single systemic ventricle, these patients remain at
constant risk for the development and progression of cardiac failure. Unfortunately, very little is known about
how the failing SV heart differs from the failing pediatric or adult biventricular heart. Additionally, the transition
to heart failure that occurs in the SV heart is also incompletely understood. This lack of understanding in the
mechanisms underlying SV heart failure are a major hurdle in the identification of effective targeted therapies.
In addition, the rarity of SV makes it very difficult to perform prospective controlled drug studies as is routinely
done in the adult heart failure population and as a result, treatments are based on extrapolation of clinical trials
from different patient populations, anectdotal experience, or potential for theoretic perceived benefit.
Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5i), such as sildenafil, are an example of such a therapy that is
increasingly used in the SV patient population with a limited existing evidence-basis. Widespread, and fairly
indiscriminate use of PDE5i for SV patients is driven in part by several publications suggesting positive clinical
results in small series of SV patients. The recently published NHLBI FUEL (Fontan Udenafil Exercise
Longitudinal assessment) trial demonstrated improved submaximal exercise in 400 fontan patients. These
encouraging studies combined with our recent publication demonstrating increased PDE5 expression and
activity in failing SV hearts suggesting that the myocardium may be a viable target of PDE5i.
While historically the rationale for the use of PDE5i in SV is to augment pulmonary blood flow, we hypothesize
that the failing SV myocardium, and specifically the mitochondria, represent a target of PDE5i therapy as well.
Our preliminary data demonstrate: (1) Mitochondrial dysfunction, altered sirtuin signaling, and increased
mitochondrial protein acetylation in failing SV myocardium (SVHF); (2) Decreased mitochondrial reactive
oxygen species (ROS) generation detected by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) in failing SV hearts
treated ex vivo with PDE5i; (3) Decreased protein acetylation and improvement in mitochondrial function in
failing SV hearts treated ex vivo with PDE5i; (4) Impaired mitochondria function in SV Non-Failing (SVNF)
(primary transplant or Norwood specimens) hearts treated ex vivo with PDE5i; and (5) Mitochondrial
dysfunction and increased ROS in primary cardiomyocytes treated with SVHF patient serum, which is
improved by the addition of PDE5i or the SIRT 3 activator, honokiol (HNK). We hypothesize that mitochondrial
dysfunction is involved in the HF transition of SV hearts, and that PDE5i improves mitochondrial function in
failing SV hearts in a sirtuin-dependent manner. We propose the use of human tissue and a cardiomyocyte
model to complete the proposed experiments. The purpose of this project is to understand the transition to HF
in the SV population and provide pre-clinical evidence to inform more targeted use of, with the goal of
optimizing clinical care and improving outcomes."

Myeloid cells in and around the brain are at the center of proper central nervous system (CNS) function by playing crucial
roles in homeostatic surveillance and immunity1. A type of myeloid cell, microglia, are the resident immune cells of the
CNS and they are vital for neuronal network architecture and injury response1. Conversely, microglia also play a key role
in some diseases like autism2 and multiple sclerosis3. In some cases, microglia depletion is a promising therapy and relies
on known genetic regulators of microglia production4,5. However, recent research in mice and zebrafish shows
subpopulations of developmental microglia that are genetically distinguishable6,7. These data present a gap in knowledge of
the complex gene regulatory networks that govern microglia production. To begin to understand the heterogeneity of
microglia-producing genetic programs, we identified an undescribed cell in the brain that expresses canonical microglia
markers, clears debris, and expands in injury7. These microglia are labeled with Mannose Receptor C, type 1a (mrc1a)7, a
membrane receptor expressed in lymphatic and venous vasculature8. To uncover more about the genetic regulation of these
cells in our supporting data, we interrogated the transcription factor sox17. Sox17 is expressed in endothelium9,10 and was
recently shown to regulate the transdifferentiation of lymphatic vessels to blood vessels11. We found that genetic
perturbation of sox17 significantly reduced mrc1a+ microglia abundance in the embryonic zebrafish brain. Given that sox17
functions in a vast array of embryogenic processes10,12,13, it is difficult to theorize specifically how the transcription factor
could be regulating embryonic microglia production. Therefore, we carried out a CRISPR screen and identified 6 additional
candidate genetic modifiers of microglia production. The aim in the F99 proposed study is to further investigate the
effects of sox17 mutation on microglia and investigate genetic interactions between sox17 and other candidate genetic
modifiers. I will accomplish this by using a combination of in vivo timelapse imaging, in situ hybridization of mRNA, and
CRISPR gene editing. In the K00 phase of the application, the investigation of myeloid cells in and around the brain will
be expanded. Aside from microglia, novel populations of other myeloid cells (monocytes and neutrophils) have also been
identified in the brain14. These monocytes and neutrophils are skull bone-marrow derived, and are genetically distinct from
previously-described populations of these cells14. However, it remains unknown if the skull bone marrow could be a source
for CNS myeloid cells during development and if microglia are amongst these cells. The goal of the K00 proposed study
is to investigate the postnatal skull bone marrow (P7, P10) as a source of myeloid cells during development. I will
accomplish this by using a combination of fate mapping, cell tracking, intravital imaging, and immunofluorescence
approaches. This work has the potential to inform the clinic of genes that impact myeloid cell development so that we may
increase the efficacy of diagnostic testing and therapeutic strategies for treating neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative
disorders."

Over 30 million intubations are performed every year in the US. Unfortunately, improper endotracheal tube (ETT)
placement (esophageal intubation) and insufficient ETT monitoring (unintended extubation) result in patient injury
and ~$12B in unnecessary costs each year in the US. Delivery of respiratory support after intubation requires
the ETT to be initially placed in the correct position and remain at this correct position post placement. Despite
these two critical requirements for a life sustaining ETT, existing ETT and ETT position monitoring technologies
do not provide adequate tracking during both initial placement and post placement monitoring. Therefore, this
project’s ultimate objective is to develop a cost-effective optical sensor-enabled endotracheal tube (the OS-ETT)
allowing both proper initial positioning and continuous positional monitoring of OS-ETT, which will substantially
reduce the risk and incidence of esophageal intubation and unintended extubation. The OS-ETT’s optical
sensors, signal processing algorithm, and visualization screen will present a real-time anatomical image allowing
real-time OS-ETT positional tracking enabling both proper initial positioning and continuous positional
monitoring. Furthermore, the OS-ETT’s optical sensors will be incorporated into a standard ETT minimizing
workflow modifications and ensuring compatibility with existing respiratory support systems. Additionally, the OS-
ETT will not require calibration or data input from the user. Lastly, the OS-ETT transmits positional information
to a visualization screen allowing for remote monitoring. This SBIR Phase I application will demonstrate the
feasibility of the OS-ETT by 1) optimizing the LED-photodiode array and signal processing algorithm for vocal
cord identification and 2) evaluating the OS-ETT for vocal cord identification in the live porcine model. After
completion of this SBIR Phase I project, Phase II will develop the image processing screen, conduct GLP testing,
and complete standard biocompatibility, sterilization, and packaging validation tests in preparation for a First-in-
Human clinical study."

Preterm birth is a leading cause of infant mortality and morbidity, with an estimated 13.4 million babies born
preterm in 2020. The rate of preterm birth varies across countries, ranging from 4% to 16%. Notably, preterm
birth now represents the leading cause of death among children under 5 years of age. Preterm birth ranks among
the most complex and pressing challenges in obstetrics. Most preterm births occur spontaneously, making the
identification of women at risk for spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) a paramount issue. Premature softening,
shortening, and dilation of the cervix, which may be considered early mechanical failure, is associated with
preterm birth. Clinical findings support the hypothesis that cervical elastography may provide effective
biomarkers for predicting preterm delivery. However, in current clinical practice, the progress of cervical ripening
is often monitored subjectively through visual inspection and digital examination. The digital cervical score and
Bishop score, while used as predictors of sPTB, show relatively low diagnostic accuracy, ranging from 61% to
68%. Despite numerous risk factors associated with sPTB having been identified in previous decades, the ability
to accurately predict when spontaneous labor will occur remains elusive. That is why the validation of novel
biomarkers, which could identify conditions leading to sPTB with a high level of confidence, is so important. In
Phases I and II of the research, a novel, cost-effective technique was developed and tested in feasibility and
development clinical studies. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that cervical elasticity,
expressed as the stress-to-strain ratio, had 95.0% accuracy (95% CI, 88.5–100.0) for predicting sPTB. The
developed probe, integrating four tactile and a single ultrasound transducer, demonstrated potential in predicting
sPTB cost-effectively. The primary aim of Phase IIB is to conduct a clinical validation study on 750 pregnant
women, collecting data at the end of the second trimester using the updated pre-production Cervix Monitor
device. This data will facilitate two separate FDA submissions: one for a measurement claim and another for a
diagnostic claim. The overarching objective of this project is to introduce a compact, cost-effective, and user-
friendly device into clinical practice, designed for the detection of conditions leading to sPTB."

Over 25% of adult women experience pelvic floor disorders including stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Stress
urinary incontinence is characterized by involuntary urination when pressure is exerted on the bladder, such as
coughing, sneezing, laughing, jogging and other forms of physical exercises. Incontinence can have a significant
impact on a woman’s quality of life and while there are non-surgical interventions such as pelvic floor exercises
and pessaries, the failure rate is up to 50%. Many women for which non-surgical interventions have been
inadequate, resort to surgical solutions such as midurethral sling placement. Of the 300,000 patients who receive
midurethral sling surgeries in the US every year, 2-3% experience mesh erosion and up to 20% remain
incontinent which may require revision surgeries where more synthetic mesh is placed, compounding the
problem. The primary objective of this Phase I STTR is to establish feasibility of a natural, coaxial electrospun
scaffold to be used as an alternative to synthetic surgical mesh. Our team is developing a naturally derived
scaffold that will dissolve over time and replace the support of the urethra with healthy formation of scar tissue.
The Phase I project will focus on the fabrication of coaxial scaffolds using silk fibroin and polyhydroxybutyrate
and the attachment and deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) of fibroblasts to those scaffolds compared to
state-of-the-art polypropylene. The deposition of ECM of fibroblasts onto the scaffold demonstrates feasibility of
the scaffold to promote fibrous growth as the scaffold degrades over time. If our device is successful, we will
decrease the complications and need for revision surgeries for thousands of women undergoing midurethral
sling placements. We hypothesize that a coaxial scaffold with the combination of silk fibroin surrounding a PHB
core will provide increased mechanical properties and cell attachment points. In Specific Aim 1, we will develop
a tunable protocol to fabricate coaxial scaffolds of different weight percentages. In Specific Aim 2, we will validate
that our coaxial scaffolds are mechanically strong enough to support the urethra by comparing to the properties
defined by Lei et al. Finally, in Specific Aim 3, we will compare ECM deposition and proliferation of fibroblasts
on the coaxially spun scaffolds to the synthetic polypropylene mesh. If all criterion are met and feasibility is
developed, our device has the potential to move women’s health to a more biocompatible and effective
alternative for stress urinary incontinence."
11008165,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Current antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens have rendered HIV a manageable chronic condition rather than a
fatal disease, with people who initiate ART soon after infection achieving nearly normal life expectancy. As a
consequence of increased survival, more women living with HIV (WLWH) will now undergo menopause and be
subject to a disease burden that reflects age along with adverse skeletal consequences of postmenopausal
estrogen deficiency. In addition to known bone loss and increased fracture risk in postmenopausal women, ART
also causes negative impacts on bone. Therefore ART-suppressed WLWH may have a compounded detrimental
effect on bone due to long-term ART treatment combined with menopause. We hypothesize that treatment with
estrogen replacement will attenuate the increased rate of bone loss during menopause and improve bone health
even with congruent administration of ART. We will address this hypothesis using a previously NIH-funded
project that employs a novel non-human primate model that replicates the sequence of acute infection, ART
initiation, chronic suppressed infection, and subsequent menopause now characteristic of a growing proportion
of aging WLWH. We intend to measure the impact of ART-suppression and menopause, with and without
hormone replacement therapy, on bone architecture and quality. Furthermore, we will determine whether bone
marrow, a known HIV reservoir, is deficient in necessary bone cell precursors. In conclusion, these studies will
examine bone health in an aging population of WLWH and potentially inform future care options utilizing hormone
replacement therapy to protect these women from compounded risk of bone fractures and osteoporosis."

 Mental health problems are increasing worldwide; however, the vast majority of people struggling with
mental health challenges do not receive any treatment and the mental health workforce is woefully insufficient
to meet our population-level needs. Digital Therapeutics (DTx) are optimally positioned to tackle these
challenges and transform mental health care. DTx are clinical-grade software used to prevent, treat, or
manage a medical disorder or disease. DTx can have a major impact on health costs, health behavior, and
health outcomes. For example, DTx can effectively treat depression, anxiety, ADHD, panic disorder and eating
disorders, among many other mental health conditions. And, they are associated with marked reductions in ED
visits, inpatient utilization, and net costs, and increases in medication adherence.
Despite their impressive clinical value, several challenges persist in fully realizing the potential of DTx
to improve people’s lives globally. First, the pace at which DTx are developed, tested, and commercialized is
slow. Second, many development activities are redundant across projects. Third, due to budget, time and
capacity constraints, many scientists develop prototypes of DTx that can be used in research but which are not
built to scale for large numbers of users. Finally, most DTx cannot be readily modified for various populations
critical for advancing digital health equity (adapted to culture, language, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation).
 Based on over two decades of NIH-supported work developing, evaluating and commercializing DTx, we
have developed a unique DTx platform (Laddr) which integrates science-based, therapeutic processes to
address a wide range of behavioral problems within a single digital platform. This platform offers the potential
to revolutionize digital health - as it provides a scalable model for delivering DTx to treat any disorder with a
behavioral component. We now plan to make an editable version of Laddr (called Cogito) commercially
available to developers of DTx. Cogito will provide a turnkey solution for rapidly developing, evaluating,
deploying, and scaling DTx for the prevention, treatment and/or management of any disease or disorder - via a
drag and drop interface with no programming necessary.
 In this Phase 1 SBIR application, we will finalize several features of the Cogito platform to increase its
commercial potential as a turnkey platform for developing and hosting DTx. And we will assess the feasibility,
technical merit, and commercial potential of the Cogito DTx platform via usability testing with clinical
researchers. We will focus on the usability of Cogito with researchers in the mental health field in this initial
phase and then expand to a broad clinical research community focused on the prevention, treatment, or
management of various health conditions in future iterations of this work.
to markedly accelerate the pace and impact of science based DTx.
Overall, Cogito offers great promise"
11008026,"The use of PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) has become an important technology for modulating
a target protein by degradation. PROTACs are heterobifunctional molecules that connect a ligand bound to a
protein of interest (POI) to an E3 ubiquitin ligase (E3) recruiting ligand with an optimal linker. Degradation is
initiated when PROTAC promotes the POI and the E3 ligase to form a ternary complex. Since the two proteins
are expected to favorably interact with each other and also with a flexible linker, the design of the optimal linker
that yields the desired POI-PROTAC-E3 complex is a challenge, and current computational tools provide limited
help. We address three important problems leading to improved PROTAC design. First, we have recently
developed and tested an effective protocol for predicting high accuracy models of POI-PROTAC-E3
ligase ternary complexes. Our Aim 1 is to implement the protocol as an easy-to-use computer program
for licensing. The method is based generating two large ensembles (“clouds”) of half-linker
conformations, one linked to the warhead bound to the POI and the other to the “anchor” ligand bound
to the E3 ligase, and use a modified version of our efficient protein-protein docking program PIPER to
directly sample conformations that have a favorable relative orientation of the two proteins and in which
the end points of some half-linkers are close to each other. After local refinement, each resulting
conformation yields a feasible structure of the ternary complex, including the linker. After removing
poses that do not assure accessibility to ubiquitination sites, the new method consistently generates
high accuracy models among the top few predictions. It was shown that in most cases the best model
can be selected by clustering a set of models generated for different PROTACs with the same E3 ligase
and target protein. In Aim 2 we explore the use of both Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics methods
to generate ensembles of structures around the models in order to determine the stability of the ternary
complex and to predict its dissociation constant Kd and the level of binding cooperativity. Increasing
the latter tends to reduce the hook effect. A highly efficient Monte Carlo method, specific to applications
to PROTAC ternary complexes, is also developed. In Aim 3 we compare maximal degradation
percentage (Dmax) and half maximal degradation concentration (DC50) values, measured in cellular
essays available in the literature, to calculated Kd and cooperativity values in order to separate the
impact of bioavailability related linker properties such as membrane permeability and solubility.
Methods from the three aims will enable predicting POI-PROTAC-E3 structures, Kd and cooperativity
values, and the level of cellular degradation on the basis of the two proteins, their ligands, and the
chemical structure of the linker. Thus, the software package will be useful for rational PROTAC design
as demonstrated by enquiries from companies working on development of related technologies."

There is a critical need to develop therapies targeting Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn): a major human
pathogen contributing to global morbidity and mortality. Bacterial communication is a critical contributor to
virulence, and we propose that bacterial extracellular vesicles (EVs) contribute to communication across bacteria
as well as between bacteria and the mammalian host, and in doing so, contribute to pathogenesis and serve as
therapeutic targets. This proposal is based on preliminary results that demonstrate not only that viable Spn
produce EVs (pEVs), but also that these pEVs are associated with DNA and RNA. Our hypothesis is that the
nucleic acids on pEVs are delivered to other bacteria, and that uptake of pEV RNA by bacterial cells promotes
changes in gene expression and subsequent changes in phenotypes. Conclusion of this proposal will reveal the
molecules tethering nucleic acids to pEVs, uncover the sequence and localization of pEV-bound RNA, and test
whether and how internalization of EVs, and RNA on pEVs, modifies the transcriptional profile of the recipient
bacterial cells. This work will set the stage for future studies focused on the role of pEV-nucleic acids in driving
infection-associated phenotypes and host immunity."

The long-term goals of this project are to translate to the clinic innovative kidney-targeted therapeutics for
glomerular disease. The interdisciplinary and translational team is led by a Biomedical Engineer with mentors
and collaborators in Cell Biology, Nephrology, and a Pharmacology. End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) affects
over 800,000 Americans, substantially increasing health and financial burdens related to dialysis or renal
transplants. ESKD is preceded by chronic kidney disease (CKD), which arises from varying etiologies, including
diabetes and hypertension, affecting 37 million Americans and over 800 million individuals worldwide. Taken
together, proteinuric kidney diseases account for 90% of all ESKD at an estimated cost of $20 billion per year in
the US. Substantial health disparities exist in the diagnosis and treatment of CKD, wherein African Americans
are four times more likely than white Americans to progress to ESKD and represent 35% of all patients on
dialysis. In addition to substantial socioeconomic risk factors, genetic and epigenetic alterations contribute to
these disparities. Prior work by the collaborators at MSSM (Campbell, Wong) and others identified injury of the
glomerular-resident podocytes as a partial driver of proteinuric CKD and progression to ESKD. Published studies
by the lead PI (Williams) and mentor (Jaimes) discovered that safe, biocompatible polymeric mesoscale
nanoparticles (MNPs) exhibit 26-fold selective targeting to the kidneys over any other organ. Those published
studies used this MNP system to load various payloads, with 9 total published studies ranging from small
molecules to biologics (peptides, siRNA, mRNA) and demonstrated their therapeutic efficacy in five separate
rodent models of renal disease. We produced innovative data demonstrating an unexpected localization of these
particles to the podocytes in the context of proteinuric glomerular disease, as opposed to prior studies showing
targeting to the tubular epithelium within the kidneys. In this work, we will capitalize on this finding by delivering
a therapeutic payload to the glomerulus in rodent models of glomerular disease. We will deliver the therapeutic
amiloride, an FDA-approved diuretic used to treat hypertension. Studies have found that amiloride has off-target,
podocyte protective effects, though clinical trials demonstrated limited efficacy in part due to poor pharmacology
of the drug with respect to the kidney. Here, we propose to encapsulate amiloride within MNPs and to study the
pharmacology and therapeutic efficacy of this formulation in several rodent models of glomerular disease. We
plan complementary in vitro and in vivo studies to understand the mechanistic function of amiloride-loaded
MNPs, as well as to investigate the unexpected finding of glomerular MNP targeting in the context of glomerular
disease. We anticipate future work may pursue the encapsulation of more potent novel amiloride analogs, as
well as pre-clinical large-animal studies, to enable clinical trials. In the long term, we expect this work will reduce
morbidity and mortality associated with the progression of CKD to ESKD. The active collaborative/mentoring
team expects this work to lead to competitive NIH R01 applications."

in the US. Their work has received awards, been published in journals of high quality (highest impact journals
in rehabilitation), and been frequently cited. In addition, 6/11 of our trainees who are in faculty positions have
been PI or Co-I on NIH funding, with 4 as PIs on active R01 grants. Additionally, our most recent cadre of T32
program graduates have funding from private foundations (e.g., American Heart Association), PCORI, and one
is a Fulbright Scholar. These data are a representation of the outstanding scientific impact of our previous
trainees. It is also notable that all of the current trainees or those who are in post-doctoral positions have
received scholarships and/or external funding, again a testament to the outstanding productivity and quality of
work of our trainees. The program fuses two independent training programs: an outstanding entry level
Doctorate in Physical Therapy (DPT) and a very successful interdisciplinary PhD program in Biomechanics and
Movement Science. The program is analogous to the MD/PhD programs that train medical scientists. By
helping to reduce the often sizable debt incurred during the DPT training program, trainees are able to delay
the opportunity to earn the salaries that clinicians enjoy and move directly into the PhD program. Students in
the program become both physical therapists and rehabilitation research scientists. Trainees are selected from
a pool of outstanding students with diverse undergraduate backgrounds who enter the DPT program. Many of
these students express an interest in research before admission to the program. This training program attracts
the best and brightest individuals with a sincere interest in physical rehabilitation research and tracks them
early in their training into research careers. The need is enormous. Both new and established academic
physical therapy programs need doctorally trained individuals for teaching and research positions. Graduates
of this training program are ideal faculty members who foster excellence in rehabilitation research."
11006371,"Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. For decades, there
have not been significant advances in the treatment for MB, which still includes surgery, radiation
and chemotherapy. Unfortunately, these treatments can cause severe side effects, including
lifelong cognitive deficiencies, endocrine dysfunction, neurological defects, emotional and social
problems, and secondary tumors. Such treatment-associated toxicities are particularly severe in
children, as their brains are still growing. The most aggressive and fatal MB have high levels of
the known oncogene MYC and are highly dependent on MYC for growth and progression. MYC
is well established as a critical driver of many types of cancer, but as a transcription factor, it has
proven to be very difficult to target therapeutically. We have shown that MYC expression and
protein stability in MB are regulated by EYA2 through its unique tyrosine phosphatase (Tyr Ptase)
activity. We identified a class of potent and selective small-molecule allosteric EYA2 Tyr Ptase
inhibitors and have shown that a representative compound selectively reduces MYC levels and
inhibits MB cell line growth at low to sub micromolar concentrations, efficiently crosses the blood
brain barrier via multiple routes of administration and inhibits MB growth in an intracranial mouse
model when delivered by oral gavage. We improved the activity/selectivity and drug-like
properties of the initial compound through comprehensive medicinal chemistry and have a lead
compound, SD3-146, with favorable CNS PK properties in preliminary analyses. In this Phase I
STTR project we will test the hypothesis that it is feasible to develop SD3-146 into a highly
efficacious and less toxic therapeutic to inhibit MYC, and thus MYC-MB growth. The first
Aim is to optimize and scale up synthesis of SD3-146 and more thoroughly evaluate drug
metabolism and pharmacokinetics (DMPK) properties and potential toxicities, so as to determine
the optimal dosage and timing for delivery in vivo. The second Aim is to verify its on-target effect
(pharmacodynamics, PD) and efficacy in mouse MB models. With successful completion of these
aims, we expect to have sufficient data to inform a GO/NO GO decision to take our lead compound
through an STTR Phase II project for further pre-clinical development. Because EYA2 has been
shown to regulate MYC levels in other cancers, including breast cancer and glioblastoma, the
drug we develop may have broad applicability for treating several other difficult-to-treat cancers.
Thus, the proposed research could set the stage for targeting the “undruggable” super-controller
MYC, through EYA2, in multiple tumor types."
11006464,"One in four people will experience a stroke, with 50-70% experiencing chronic movement impairment.
While intensive rehabilitation exercise reduces movement impairment, most individuals do not receive
enough therapy during in-clinic visits to recover to their full potential and therapists routinely prescribe
home exercise programs to supplement in-clinic therapy. However, individuals struggle to adhere to these
prescribed programs. Thus, deploying strategies that promote adherence with prescribed home exercise
is critical for maximizing recovery in individuals post stroke, especially during the heightened period of
neuroplasticity early after stroke. In 2022, Medicare released 5 new reimbursement codes for Remote
Therapeutic Monitoring or RTM. These RTM codes can be billed by physical and occupational therapists
for remotely monitoring adherence to a home exercise program. These RTM codes thus represent a key
opportunity for therapists to interface with their patients at home and encourage improved adherence to
home exercises in a cost-effective way. However, there has been relatively low uptake of these new codes
due to a lack of enabling technologies that address real-world implementation barriers. Recognizing this
critical gap, we began developing MiGo Tracker, the first FDA-listed, wrist-worn exercise sensor that can
be used to seamlessly implement RTM in routine post-stroke care. MiGo Tracker monitors adherence for
any at-home exercise modality therapists already use (e.g. digital home exercise programs, printed
handouts, or videos recorded on patients’ phones; users simply don the MiGo Tracker before exercising
and remove it when they are done). Then, MiGo Tracker uploads the data via a proprietary Bluetooth-
cellular Gateway without any interaction with a user (i.e. no smartphone app or internet access is
required). Therapists can review MiGo Tracker data and document their interactions with patients on a
custom, easy-to-use RTM dashboard, which will include tools for electronic health record (EHR) integration
and billing documentation to receive reimbursement. We believe that an RTM program that uses MiGo
Tracker will readily integrate with current rehabilitation workflows, enabling useful, data-driven remote
interactions between therapists and patients that will lead to improved recovery outcomes. Our primary
objectives for this Direct to Phase II project are: Aim 1) Complete MiGo Tracker firmware development
based on end-user feedback; Aim 2) Complete online HIPAA-compliant RTM dashboard; Aim 3) Determine
the safety and effectiveness of a MiGo Tracker RTM program in a randomized controlled trial with
individuals with subacute stroke (N=50). We hypothesize that the participants in the MiGo Tracker RTM
group will have significantly higher FM Scores by a clinically meaningful amount at three-months post
stroke than the usual care group. If successful, MiGo Tracker will lead to increased home exercise
adherence and improved health outcomes for thousands of individuals following stroke."
11004907,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Immunocompromised individuals—such as people with HIV (PWH), autoimmune conditions, and a history of
solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation—bear a significantly higher burden of human
papillomavirus (HPV)-related anogenital disease compared with immunocompetent people. While HPV
vaccination offers a key opportunity for prevention, studies in immunocompromised populations have primarily
evaluated vaccine immunogenicity and safety. Many of these prior studies demonstrated reduced antibody
seroconversion rates and duration of immune responses for immunocompromised populations compared with
the general population. While this may translate to attenuated protection against anogenital disease, additional
studies that directly evaluate vaccine effectiveness (VE) are warranted to inform optimal use of HPV vaccine in
these high-risk individuals. To date, there have only been a few HPV vaccine trials in PWH evaluating clinical
disease (e.g., condyloma, cervical dysplasia/cancer, and anal dysplasia/cancer), but these were limited by
sample size, and none were conducted in people with non-HIV immunocompromising conditions. To address
these major knowledge gaps, we propose a cohort study in two integrated health systems to evaluate HPV VE
for preventing anogenital disease among three distinct groups of immunocompromised people: (Aim 1) PWH;
(Aim 2) people with autoimmune conditions (i.e., systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], rheumatoid arthritis
[RA], and inflammatory bowel disease [IBD], each evaluated separately); and (Aim 3) people with a solid organ
or hematopoietic stem cell transplant history. We will evaluate VE for incident disease and recurrent disease
among those treated for prior anogenital lesions. We will also perform HPV genotyping on archived anogenital
clinical specimens to estimate VE for cervical and anal dysplasia/cancer associated with vaccine-targeted HPV
types. Finally, we will evaluate VE by key vaccination characteristics, including age at vaccination, doses, time
since vaccine, vaccine timing (before/after immunocompromising condition), and disease-specific factors (e.g.,
CD4 count for Aim 1, immunosuppressive medication use for Aim 2, and transplant type for Aim 3). We
anticipate cohorts of ~35,000 PWH, ~15,800 with SLE, ~25,100 with RA, ~34,300 with IBD, and ~21,300 with a
transplantation history from years 2006-2022. We will also assemble cohorts of 20:1 demographically matched
immunocompetent people to enable comparison of VE estimates with the corresponding immunocompromised
groups. We are uniquely positioned to address the Aims given the large samples, long-term membership
retention, detailed electronic health records, and archived tissue specimens. We anticipate our findings will
inform tailored HPV vaccination strategies for diverse immunocompromised populations, including clarifying
potential boosting options and benefits of extending catch-up ages, and will therefore be of great interest to
guideline groups, clinicians, and patients."
11004730,"ABSTRACT: The overall goal of Jacaranda Biosciences, Inc. (JBI) is to develop compounds that will treat a
broad range of hearing loss indications. In this targeted SBIR project, we propose to generate, test and optimize
a series of novel JBI compounds that function through the unfolded protein response (UPR) to prevent the
ototoxicity and hearing loss caused by Cisplatin treatment. In Phase 2 of our work, relying on proof-of-concept
obtained in this initial phase, we plan to engage in a lead optimization effort to ultimately ready our team for a
first in human hearing loss (HL) treatment trial through this UPR molecular pathway.
Significance: Cisplatin, while a widely-used and highly effective chemotherapeutic, it has a major dose-limiting
side effect of ototoxicity, with nearly all cisplatin recipients having significant hearing loss.
Innovation: Through our recent and novel work in genetic and noise-induced hearing loss animal models we
discovered that homeostatic regulation of the UPR in the cochlea is a key way to prevent over-activation of the
UPR and subsequent hair cell death and hearing loss. Further detailed work has shown that eif2B activators can
specifically prevent hair cell death and hearing loss in both noise-induced and genetic HL models. We have also
generated exciting and compelling data that cisplatin ototoxicity can be treated through the same eif2B activator
arm of the UPR. To take advantage of these insights, we will optimize JBI synthesized eiF2B activators to
address UPR overactivation to treat cisplatin ototoxicity.
Aim 1. Optimize the efficacy and physicochemical properties of our IP-protected, novel eiF2B activators.
To achieve this we will fine-tune our medicinal chemistry winnowing strategy using structure-based, rational drug
design to enable us to build a range of compounds that will not only show model based effectiveness, but also
generate compounds that have superior in vitro absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME)
properties along with rodent-based intraperitoneal (IP) pharmacokinetics.
Aim 2. Test whether optimized eiF2B activators from Aim 1 can show a reduction in deleterious side-effects
seen in the eiF2B toolkit compound ISRIB. We will also select from amongst our well-designed novel compounds
those that lessen apoptosis and UPR over-activation in our in vitro cisplatin toxicity models.
Aim 3. Test whether the candidate compounds optimized by in vitro chemistry and reduced toxicity in Aims #1
and #2 will show effectiveness in our in vivo assays, both selecting those that show reduced hair cell /cisplatin
ototoxicity along with loss in cochlear explants and also demonstrate effectiveness in protecting auditory
brainstem response (ABR) thresholds.
Summary: By the completion of Phase 1, we will have identified compounds with pre-clinical in vivo efficacy
from which we can advance to the next steps of drug development (Phase 2), including lead optimization,
entailing a more fully investigated PK, pharmacodynamics, and detailed toxicology properties."
11006492,"ABSTRACT
Despite being easily treatable, STIs such as Chlamydia (infection with Chlamydia trachomatis) and Gonorrhea
(infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae) represent the majority of reportable annual STI cases, indicating that
screening and detection efforts for these STIs are inadequate. Untreated infections with C. trachomatis or N.
gonorrhoeae can result in increased risk for HIV in both men and women, however, untreated infections in
women are more likely to result in long-term adverse health effects, such as pelvic inflammatory disease,
infertility, and pregnancy complications. As the majority of infections are asymptomatic in women, access to
accurate screening is critical in this population. Several barriers limit the screening habits of sexually-active
adults, including lack of privacy in clinical settings, fear of stigmatization by visiting a healthcare professional for
testing, and access to clinics, appointments, and results in a timely and equitable manner. Additionally, current
gold-standard STI tests are generally only available in-clinic, and require expensive heating or electrical
components, making regular screening expensive and inaccessible to the lay consumer. Alternative technologies
without these components do not provide PCR-level accuracy.
Sherlock’s goal is to develop a PCR-level STI diagnostic device to detect C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae
from self-collected vaginal swabs, and which does not require any isothermal or cycled heating elements, battery
power, or force in the product design. Specifically, this project will utilize a proprietary amplification chemistry
based on high-sensitivity, high-specificity assays, in combination with a prototype microfluidic device design that
will control the timed assay amplification and produce an easy-to-read output. 300 vaginal swabs will be qPCR
screened for absence of target pathogens, then spiked with in-house cultured C. trachomatis and N.
gonorrhoeae. Aim 1 will identify the optimal filter and neutralizing chemical treatment to separate and neutralize
human genomic DNA which can obscure pathogen detection from samples, while Aim 2 will establish optimal
lyophilized reagent bead size and timing delay, and Aim 3 will assess the device sensitivity, specificity, and
failure rate using positive clinical samples. This project will aid in refining the prototype accuracy for validation
and extension to other STIs in Phase 2, and will demonstrate the potential of Sherlock’s proprietary amplification
chemistry and power-free microfluidics design for at-home PCR-level tests. By creating a heating and power-
free molecular test for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae that is accurate, transportable, easy-to-use and read,
and inexpensive, this device can be utilized by the lay consumer in point-of-need settings (at-home) rather than
only in point-of-care settings (in-clinic), thereby creating a more accessible and equitable STI screening product."
10976257,"Summary
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a biologically and genetically heterogeneous hematopoietic malignancy
characterized by the blockage of myeloid cell differentiation and uncontrolled proliferation of immature myeloid
cells. Although treatment options for AML have progressed over the past few decades, the 5-year overall survival
of AML patients is still <30%. Therefore, there remains a high unmet need to develop novel and more effective
AML therapies, which requires a
deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of AML and the identification of
novel and effective molecular targets. Our preliminary data showed that paraspeckle protein component 1
(PSPC1) is highly overexpressed in virtually all types of human AMLs, and PSPC1 knockdown (KD) profoundly
suppresses proliferation, promotes apoptosis, and induces robust differentiation of diverse AML cells and
abrogates their leukemogenic capacity. Furthermore, Pspc1 deletion has little effect on hematopoietic
stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) function, steady-state hematopoiesis, or normal mouse development. Despite being
a member of the Drosophila Behavior/Human Splicing (DBHS) protein family associated with nuclear
paraspeckles containing SFPQ and NONO, neither paraspeckles nor NONO is involved in PSPC1-mediated
hyperproliferation and myeloid differentiation arrest in AML cells. Moreover, neither the N-terminal RNA
recognition/binding motifs nor the C-terminal coiled-coil domain (essential for dimerization) of PSPC1 is
important for the pathogenic function of PSPC1 in AML cells. Integrated PSPC1 ChIP-seq and RNA-seq
analyses in WT vs. PSPC1 KD AML cells identified key target genes important for oncogenesis, proliferation,
survival, and differentiation of AML cells, and motif analysis revealed putative transcription factors (TFs) that
may associate with PSPC1 in target gene transcriptional activation and repression. Based on these exciting
findings, we hypothesize that PSPC1 acts as a novel determinant for AML leukemogenesis and that PSPC1
inhibition represents a safe and highly effective therapeutic strategy for various AMLs where PSPC1 interacts
with key TFs to dictate a unique leukemic transcription program underlying multiple AMLs. To test this
hypothesis, we will: 1) use the loss-of-function genetic strategy to further validate that PSPC1 is a novel
therapeutic target for AML; 2) determine whether PSPC1 is a common target for AML induced by different AML
drivers and whether other oncogenes are required for PSPC1 to induce AML; and 3) dissect the molecular
mechanisms by which PSPC1 induces AML by defining PSPC1-regulated common transcriptome and the
PSPC1 interactome across multiple AML subentities and studying the contribution of PSPC1 partners/target
genes to AML characteristics and leukemogenesis. The success of the proposed studies will gain fundamental
knowledge on AML biology and leukemogenesis by establishing PSPC1 as a critical and novel determinant for
AML leukemogenesis, which can lead to the breakthrough in AML treatment by developing ways to target PSPC1
using RNAi and/or small molecule inhibitors as a safe and effective therapeutic strategy for various AMLs."
10976548,"Firearms are now the leading cause of death for young people in the United States, with stark inequities for
young people from minoritized communities (e.g., race, ethnicity, LGTBQ+ populations). Secure firearm storage
programs are evidence-based, low-cost, scalable, and non-politically divisive. Current efforts to implement these
programs primarily occur in ambulatory and acute care settings in largely well-resourced health systems. There
is a need to study adaptation and implementation of these programs in community settings including federally
qualified health centers (FQHCs) and look-alike safety net health centers. These community settings currently
serve 1 in 11 people seeking health care in the United States and prioritize offering services to all areas and
populations, thus making them critical partners for efforts to promote equitable delivery to all populations. In
2023, our team completed the largest hybrid effectiveness-implementation type III trial of its kind (R01
MH123491; “ASPIRE”), in which ~45,000 pediatric well-visits in 30 clinics in two large health systems were
eligible to receive S.A.F.E. Firearm, an evidence-based, universal secure firearm storage program that includes
a brief conversation between a clinician and parent about secure firearm storage and offering free cable locks.
Prior to implementation, clinicians delivered these program components in 3% of well-visits. After clinics and
clinicians received training, clinical decision support in the electronic health record, and facilitation, clinicians
delivered these program components in 41% of well-visits, representing robust practice change that can save
lives. In the proposed study, “COMMUNITY-ASPIRE,” we partner with AllianceChicago, a national practice-
based research network, and the Illinois Primary Health Care Association, the state-wide organization for
FQHCs, to study the adaptation and implementation of S.A.F.E. Firearm in Illinois FQHCs. In Aim 1, in
collaboration with key partners (e.g., clinicians, leaders, parents), we will adapt and optimize S.A.F.E. Firearm
and our implementation approach for FQHCs. In Aim 2, we will conduct a pragmatic hybrid type III stepped
wedge effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial with 12 FQHCs and 720 participants across
Illinois to test the effectiveness of our adapted implementation approach (training and facilitation emphasizing
equitable S.A.F.E. Firearm delivery) on parent-reported receipt of S.A.F.E. Firearm (i.e., reach; primary
implementation outcome). We will also assess secondary implementation outcomes (stage of implementation,
cost, acceptability) and effectiveness outcomes (parent firearm storage behavior). In Aim 3, we will use mixed
methods to identify mechanisms. First, we will conduct interviews to understand constituent perspectives on
implementation mechanisms and equitable intervention receipt. Second, we will evaluate reach and firearm
storage behavior by demographic characteristics and social determinants of health. Results will guide future
implementation of secure firearm storage programs in FQHCs and prioritize scalability, generalizability, and
equity. Successful strategies can be taken to scale to save lives, in keeping with the NINR strategic plan."
10976688,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Survival from cervical cancer is stagnating in the United States. Despite many intervening clinical trials, the
standard of care (SOC) definitive chemoradiation therapy (CRT) has remained unchanged since the addition of
concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy to radiation in the 1990’s. Reasons for this are several-fold, and
include a patient population that is disproportionately affected by barriers to care, inherent radioresistance of
gross disease as evidenced by local recurrence after a mean primary tumor dose of >200Gy delivered with
brachytherapy plus EBRT, and insufficient systemic control, with distant failure contributing to two thirds of
cervical cancer deaths. A suboptimal immune response at the time of definitive CRT is associated with local,
regional, and distant recurrence, as well as death from cervical cancer. We have previously shown that
enrichment of immunosuppressive cells and high expression of squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA),
known as SERPINB3, are associated with higher risk of recurrence after SOC CRT in cervical cancer, and that
CRT induces further infiltration of tumor permissive myeloid derived cells. Preliminary data suggest that tumor
associated macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and regulatory T cells are increased in mid-
treatment tumor specimens from patients undergoing standard CRT. Using preclinical models, we find that
brachytherapy stimulated expression of immune-stimulatory signals to a greater degree than an equivalent dose
of EBRT. Finally, SERPINB3 directly promotes expression of chemokines that recruit immune-suppressive cells,
particularly myeloid-derived sub-populations, blunting the T-cell anti-tumor response in cervical cancer. We
hypothesize that brachytherapy alone delivered to the primary tumor prior to regional lymph node EBRT will
safely minimize patient trips, further stimulate the immune system, and potentiate the efficacy of immunotherapy.
Two aims are proposed to directly test this hypothesis: Aim 1 will determine if accelerated brachytherapy-forward
chemoradiation therapy (ABC-RT) is a safe and effective approach to shorten overall treatment time, and
maximize anti-tumor immune response through a phase I/II clinical trial for patients with locally advanced cervical
cancer. Aim 2 will determine if ABC-RT potentiates the anti-tumor activity of immune checkpoint therapies and/or
the myeloid-cell inhibitor CCR2i using a preclinical murine tumor model with a novel intracavitary brachytherapy
system developed for this proposal. Secondary endpoints to validate candidate biomarkers SERPINB3, and post
therapy FDG-PET as predictors of recurrence after this experimental approach are proposed to precisely stratify
patients for subsequent trials incorporating drug-ABC-RT combinations. Success of these aims will provide the
preliminary data to support randomized trials of ABC-RT based regimens compared to the SOC and ultimately
a paradigm shift in the definitive treatment of cervical cancer. The proposed translational studies will provide a
template for integration of therapies that synergize with CRT and the immune response. The overall goal of this
proposal is to improve survival for patients with locally advanced cervical cancer."
10978113,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Geographic and racial/ethnic disparities in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) – the leading cause of death in the
U.S. – remain large. There is a gap in the available evidence on the burden of heart failure in particular and its
role in health disparities more generally, especially at the local level. While the U.S. is rich in local health data,
the data is poorly integrated. Disease models and population health simulation are an important way to integrate
complex patterns of risk exposure and disease burden with other population trends including income, education,
aging, migration, and health care access. Previous CVD forecasts and policy models have produced only single
geography – primarily national – estimates, which cannot provide the evidence needed to address geographic
disparities. The overarching goal of this project will be to expand the evidence base for prevention and treatment
policies for heart failure in the U.S., reduce disparities, and expand publicly available datasets and software
models to support the broader use of health metrics for cardiovascular research. For this work, we will adapt
econometric, geospatial, and epidemiologic modelling methods by leveraging the large data and computational
resources of the Global Burden of Disease Study. Aim 1 is the estimation of county-level heart failure burden,
including prevalence, mortality, years of life lost prematurely and disability-adjusted life years from 2000 through
the current year as well as projections through the year 2060, by age, sex, race, ethnicity, and ejection fraction
for each U.S. state, including new data and methods to account for the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Aim
2 is a comprehensive and comparable assessment of the effect size of risk factors leading to heart failure using
a causal inference framework and attributable fraction methods. Aim 3 is the adaptation of our existing 50-state
health policy simulation (the U.S. Burden of Disease Health Policy Simulation) for use with heart failure in order
to evaluate the real-world impact of interventions to prevent or reduce the burden of heart failure when delivered
at scale. Our results are designed to guide local decision-makers considering a range of policy options to reduce
the burden of heart failure."
10976584,"Project Summary / Abstract:
Neutrophils are a major type of leukocytes that play important roles in acute inflammation. They are typically
the first leukocytes to be recruited to inflammatory sites and can eliminate pathogens by multiple mechanisms,
including releasing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Although neutrophils are important for normal immune
responses, particularly to microbial infections, they are also responsible for and/or contribute to many
inflammatory diseases, including myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI). In our preliminary studies, we
found that neutrophil-specific KO of LRP5 (Lrp5N) aggravates heart injury in the MIRI model by enhancing
neutrophil activation. Our preliminary results further indicate that LRP5 may function as a transporter for
polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and is required for PUFA-mediated inhibition of mTORC1 signaling in
neutrophils. In this application, we plan to determine how LRP5 transports PUFAs and how important LRP5-
transported PUFAs are for the regulation of neutrophil activities and inflammation diseases related to
neutrophils, including MIRI."

10993763,"Project Summary
Lung disease is one of the leading causes of death in the world today, with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD) being the third leading cause of mortality worldwide. In such diseases, airway and alveolar
functions are compromised; injuries in one region of the lung may affect and/or cause ensuing damage to other
regions. We will use the naphthalene injury model in mice to study alveolar epithelial response to acute airway
injury. The Kim Lab recently found that alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells proliferate in response to naphthalene injury.
The immune system contributes to tissue regeneration post-injury and may facilitate local cell-cell interactions
and tissue-wide responses. This project will determine if alveolar macrophages are responsible for the
proliferative AT2 response after club cell injury. First, the extent of airway cell injury after macrophage depletion
followed by naphthalene treatment will be examined by immunostaining analysis. Second, the proliferation and
differentiation response of AT2 cells after macrophage depletion and naphthalene will be determined. This
Diversity Supplement will support the scientific and career development of a research assistant. Importantly,
prior research conducted in our group has shown that alveolar cell proliferation in response to airway injury
does not occur in the aged mouse lung. Thus, the proposed studies can provide insight on how changes in the
aged lung impact lung progenitor cell function. This is directly relevant to the parent grant, particularly for Aim
1, which involves characterizing the cellular states of alveolar progenitor cells. We expect her proposed studies
will have important implications for chronic lung diseases like COPD as well as lung cancer, for which aging is a
major risk factor. The results of this work will also help us continue to better models of lung cancer in the aged
lung and to learn ways to intervene in lung cancer and lung diseases associated with age."

Structural ableism, defined as the processes, policies, and institutions that privilege able-bodied people over
disabled people, is a root cause of health inequities faced by the disability community. A necessary first step to
addressing these disability health inequities is to create validated measures of structural ableism, which is the
goal of this five-year project. This project parallels foundational work across other forms of structural oppression,
such as structural racism, classism, ageism, sexism, and heterosexism, and has three specific aims. Aim 1 will
characterize the multiple factors that comprise the construct of structural ableism, which will improve our
understanding of the multidimensionality of structural ableism in ways that support measure development. This
aim synthesizes historical, policy, and qualitative approaches, drawing on extant texts and key informant
interviews. Aim 2 develops and validates an individual-level measure of structural ableism. In partnership with
the disability community, we will translate our findings from Aim 1 into a comprehensive measure of an
individual’s experiences of discrimination across domains of structural ableism. This measure will facilitate the
identification of relationships between structural ableism and health outcomes at an individual level. Aim 3
measures structural ableism at a community level using publicly available datasets and explores its relationships
with health outcomes. We will use both participatory and statistical approaches to develop a cross-domain
composite measure of structural ableism. This includes partnering with the disability community via community
engagement studios to inform this process. The resulting measure will help quantify the relationship between
structural ableism and health outcomes at a community level. Across all three aims, we take an intersectional,
interdisciplinary, and community-grounded approach. We purposefully include disabled people across all steps
and phases of this work, with a focus on maximizing the diversity of disability perspectives by including people
across disability types and intersecting identities (e.g., race/ethnicity, gender identity, geographic location, and
other identities and demographics). Our interdisciplinary team has expertise in disability studies, public health,
medicine, health policy, systems engineering, sociology, and cultural anthropology, and is led by two disabled
PIs. Most importantly, our approach is deeply community-informed, drawing on multiple community partnerships
from local and national organizations, and a diverse advisory committee of disabled activists, advocates, and
scholars, as well as researchers with expertise in developing measures of structural oppression, such as
structural racism. By the end of the five-year project, this work will have established the characteristics of
structural ableism, developed both an individual- and community-level measure of structural ableism, and used
these measures to explore relationships between structural ableism and health outcomes. Moreover, the
measures developed during this project will lay the foundation for identifying and evaluating novel interventions
aimed at dismantling structural ableism, which should be co-created with the disability community."
10994126,"Understanding how the auditory system codes complex sounds benefits from computational models that can
predict data collected using different techniques (i.e., psychophysics vs. physiology), different species (i.e.,
human vs. animal models), and different stimuli (i.e., tones vs. speech). Existing models often focus on
modeling individual stages of the system, such as the auditory periphery (e.g., Zilany et al., 2014) or particular
binaural circuits (e.g., Wang et al., 2014). However, understanding masking in complex sounds, which is
shaped by numerous peripheral and central factors of auditory processing, demands models that integrate
multiple aspects of processing, heretofore considered separately, that jointly influence the issues under
investigation. Some of these aspects are well established, such as peripheral filtering and transduction, or
binaural integration in the subcortex, which gives rise to release from masking due to binaural cues. Others are
emerging and have generated active debates in the field, including the effects of efferent control of cochlear
gain and the sensitivity of midbrain neurons to modulated inputs, both of which have been linked to masking
(or release from masking) in complex sounds. This proposal describes a new computational model of the
human auditory subcortex that integrates these aspects of auditory processing and plans to apply it to
investigate masking in complex sounds in both normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners. The model,
which is built upon established descriptions of the mammalian auditory periphery (Zilany et al., 2014; Farhadi
et al., 2023), simulates ascending binaural processing up to the level of the inferior colliculus (IC), the binaural
hub of the auditory midbrain, as well as descending efferent pathways that regulate cochlear gain. Aim 1
focuses on binaural aspects of the model, and tests whether simulated responses from this model can predict
human behavioral performance in binaural-detection tasks, including predictions for individual trials. Aim 2
focuses on the efferent aspects of the model, and tests whether simulated efferent gain control can predict
human behavioral performance in tasks that feature a target stimulus preceded by a precursor, which could
activate the efferent system and reduce cochlear gain during the target. Aim 3 uses a model with both binaural
and efferent pathways and tests whether it can predict intelligibility of speech in complex backgrounds,
including spatial separations and binaural phasic manipulations of target and masker. Predictions of data from
listeners with and without sensorineural hearing loss will be included for several of the above tasks. The
overarching hypothesis is that simulated binaural IC activity can predict performance of both normal-hearing
and hearing-impaired listeners across a wide range of behavioral tasks. The proposed research will clarify how
peripheral changes associated with hearing loss affect neural coding in central binaural nuclei and interact with
control of cochlear gain via the MOC system, enabling the development of better algorithms for restoring
normal auditory function via hearing aids and cochlear implants."

The zinc finger transcription factor GATA1 is essential for development of a subset of hematopoietic lineages,
including erythroid cells and megakaryocytes. Inherited mutations in GATA1 are associated with a spectrum of
hematopoietic disorders including dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia, caused by mutations in the
N-terminal zinc finger, Diamond Blackfan Anemia (DBA), caused by mutations that lead to loss of the N-terminal
transactivation domain, and hemolytic anemia caused by mutations in an intrinsically disordered region. The
focus of this proposal is on understanding the consequences of loss of the N-terminal transactivation domain on
red cell development. The isoform that lacks the N-terminus is named GATA1 short, or GATA1s. Mice that mimic
these human mutations, Gata1s mice, display prominent defects in erythropoiesis in utero and a lifelong
macrocytic anemia that has some similarities to DBA. In our published and preliminary studies, we have found
that GATA1s binds chromatin to a similar extent as full length GATA1 but fails to lead to proper chromatin
accessibility or histone modifications. We hypothesize that the absence of key protein-protein interactions
between GATA1s and chromatin regulators such as SWI/SNF and NuRD complexes, leads to impaired gene
regulation. We performed single cell RNA-sequencing of E13.5 Gata1s fetal livers and identified prominent
changes in the erythroid lineage including relative increases in proerythroblasts and basophilic erythroblasts with
concomitant decreases in the polychromatic and orthochromatic stages. Within the basophilic and polychromatic
stages, we observed enrichment of pathways that control metabolism, including oxidative phosphorylation, in
the Gata1s mutant cells. We hypothesize that metabolic defects resulting from aberrant gene regulation by
GATA1s contributes to the defect in red cell maturation in mouse models and patients. In this grant, we propose
to: 1) Identify the cofactors that are recruited by the N-terminus to regulate erythropoiesis; and 2) Investigate the
role of the N-terminus in controlling erythroid gene expression and metabolism. These innovative studies will
increase our understand of how the N-terminus regulates transcription, metabolism, and erythroid maturation
and may shed light on strategies to improve erythropoiesis in DBA and other congenital anemias."

The Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS), Division of Public Health (DPH) is
applying to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the Pregnancy Risk
Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) Funding Opportunity Announcement Number: RFP-
DP-21-001, U01, Component A: Core Funding. PRAMS is an ongoing survey, conducted by the
CDC and state health departments, of mothers who recently had a live birth. PRAMS is an
essential tool in maternal and child health program and policy development, monitoring, and
evaluation and is a key source of information on disparities in birth outcomes and their risk
factors. This fourth cycle of funding will allow Wisconsin PRAMS to continue and meet the
objectives below and investigate Wisconsin’s racial and ethnic disparities during the project
period May 1, 2021 – April 30, 2026.
The objectives of Wisconsin PRAMS are as follows: (1) to understand better how behaviors,
attitudes, and experiences before, during, and immediately after pregnancy relate to and
influence racial inequities in maternal and infant outcomes; (2) to collect population-based data
of high quality not found in other data sources; and (3) to translate results into information for
planning and evaluating public health programs and policy. Wisconsin PRAMS conducts a
survey of a random sample of mothers (stratified by race/ethnicity) who have had a recent live
birth. The survey asks about maternal experiences and perspectives related to their social and
economic conditions, health behaviors, health conditions, and health care before, during, and
shortly after pregnancy. The first funding cycle, 2006 – 2011, was primarily focused on the
design of operating procedures, research, and protocol, including the sample methodology. The
second and third cycles, 2011 – 2016 and 2016-2021, respectively, focused on maintaining data
collection procedures and improving response rates, expanding the non-Hispanic black
oversample and conducting a census sample of Native women in Wisconsin, to enhance our
ability to investigate disparities. The second and third cycles also saw increased dissemination
of data for program planning both to local partners and to national stakeholders. Results from
the PRAMS survey provided compelling, stark, and unique evidence of major racial and ethnic
disparities in social determinants of health, preconception health, health behaviors, pregnancy
intention, stress, postpartum depression, and safe sleep practices.
In this third cycle, 2016 – 2021, WI PRAMS will focus on deepening and consolidating
relationships with key partners, including Wisconsin’s Tribal nations and community health
workers, to leverage PRAMS data for improved program and policy planning. PRAMS data will
be key to the development of the priorities and strategies of the new Infant and Maternal
Mortality Prevention program, created by Governor Evers in the last state biennial budget. WI
PRAMS will also explore innovative data collection methods and means of improving response
rates; pursue new and enhance existing partnerships for supplemental funding and bringing
data to meaningful action; and implement a Data to Action plan that is informed by partners,
tailored to intended audiences, disseminated through appropriate channels, and leads to
improved health outcomes for women, infants, children, and ultimately entire families."

The overarching goal of the grant is to create a comprehensive model that is dedicated to ensuring
a diverse, scholarly environment and encouraging outstanding individuals to enter the academic
profession through a commitment to inclusive excellence. This proposal represents a Partnership
between the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) and the University of Maryland
Baltimore County (UMBC). As defined by the FIRST RFA, the UMSOM is a Highly Resourced
Institution (HRI) with an average of $140 million in NIH funding over the last three years and
UMBC is a Limited-Resourced Institution (LRI) with an average of $7.5 million in NIH funding over
the last three years. The UMSOM is one of six professional schools on the University of Maryland
Baltimore (UMB) campus located in downtown Baltimore. UMBC is located just 8 miles away from
UMB. UMB and UMBC have been closely linked ever since the 1966 founding of UMBC through
a variety of interactions and relationships as described in the proposal. We will “build” upon
UMBC’s rich reputation as a public research university for producing highly capable and
competitive undergraduate and graduate scholars in a diverse setting. This new model will seek
to hire three cohorts of underrepresented scholars, who are committed to diversity in the academy
and to prepare those scholars for successful possible tenure track appointments at UMBC. In
addition, the program will encourage and support departments and programs in their efforts to
enrich their intellectual communities through the increased representation of diverse perspectives
in research, teaching, and service. Cohorts will be recruited into themed areas of cancer biology,
neuroscience, and microbiology/infectious diseases, which are all areas of significant strength at
both institutions. Ten new faculty members from underrepresented groups will be recruited, with
six recruits being primarily affiliated with the UMSOM and four recruits primarily affiliated with
UMBC. All recruits will have secondary appointments in the other institution and will undergo
faculty development and other program activities as a cohort. The general approach proposed in
this initiative is to combine the experiences and strengths of our two institutions through
leveraging existing programs and new initiatives to infuse the unbiased hiring and mentoring of
faculty, especially underrepresented minorities, into the fabric of departmental culture and thereby
affect institutional change. Of primary importance are institutional policies and procedures that
support a diverse professoriate and provide a sustainable infrastructure for it to establish and
grow."

Aging, the gradual decline in an organism's physiological functions over its lifespan, impacts all individuals. Yet,
why do some individuals age faster and show a greater susceptibility to age-related diseases, including cancer,
tissue fibrosis, and diabetes, compared to others? Mounting evidence supports the idea that aging, and the
associated process of cell senescence, are rooted in metabolic dysfunction. Metabolic dysfunction occurs when
chemical reactions become dysregulated during aging and negatively alter the body's processing and distribution
of nutrients, inducing the aberrant accumulation of certain metabolites. These metabolites can affect cellular
function by altering signaling processes and protein modifications, contributing to aging progression. The link
between aging and metabolism has solidified itself as one of the new challenges in understanding the complexity
of aging as a systemic disease. Identifying metabolic pathways and metabolites that drive cell senescence and
metabolic dysfunction is critical to understanding and treating age-related diseases.
The propionate metabolism pathway is a highly conserved pathway critical for the metabolism of certain amino
acids, odd chain fatty acids, cholesterol and propionate. The function of this pathway and its metabolites in cell
senescence and aging remains to be identified. Previous studies and my preliminary data suggest that the
activity of propionate metabolism changes with aging, and two metabolites in this pathway, methylmalonic acid
(MMA) and propionyl-CoA (P-CoA), are involved in the regulation of cell senescence, lipid metabolism and
protein modification. Therefore, I hypothesize that the propionate metabolism pathway plays a fundamental role
in the aging process. During the K99 phase of this award, I will continue dissecting the role of MMA in cell
senescence and aging-associated pulmonary fibrosis. Additionally, I will characterize a novel function of P-CoA
in lipid droplet dynamics. I will also uncover the function of a novel post-translational modification (propionylation)
on p53 (a key regulator for cell senescence) and catalog target proteins for propionylation. During the R00 phase
of this award, I will expand on my lipid droplet studies and investigate the role or P-CoA in aging-associated
ectopic fat accumulation (visceral fat deposition) and validate the target proteins for propionylation as identified
during K99 phase. Furthermore, I will identify the main target genes and functions associated with histone H3 at
lysine 23 (H3K23) propionylation during cell senescence. These investigations will pave the way for new
research projects and serve as the basis for pursuing R01 grants and other funding opportunities. This award
will allow me to expand on my training in aging physiology, metabolism and epigenetics, and gain expertise in
chromatin biology, lipid droplets dynamic, and protein post-translational modification, ultimately helping me
develop new niches (metabolic dysfunctions and aging) as an independent investigator. In addition to the
scientific objectives outlined in this proposal, I have devised a comprehensive training plan for the K99 phase of
the award to ensure a smooth transition towards independence."

Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (NOWS) is a major public health problem in the USA. Since 2000-
2012, the incidence of NOWS has increased five-fold to almost 6 per 1,000 hospital births and the associated
health care expenditures have increased from $200 million to $1.5 billion. Limited data are available on the
effects of antenatal opioid exposure on the brain and neurodevelopment because of small sample
sizes and difficulty controlling for important environmental variables. The OBOE (Outcomes of Babies
with Opioid Exposure) study, an ongoing NICHD-funded longitudinal study enrolling infants with and
without antenatal opioid exposure at birth and following them to two years of age, attempts to address
these limitations by collecting comprehensive exposure data from parental report and from infant
umbilical cord analysis; advanced neuroimaging data to evaluate brain development; standardized
information on the home environment, maternal mental health, and parenting; and neuro-
developmental outcomes to 2 years of age. The OBOE consortium, comprised of 4 highly performing
clinical centers, a data coordinating center, and a neuroimaging core, has completed our goal
enrollment of 200 opioid-exposed infants and 100 unexposed infants. In response to RFA-HD-24-014,
we now propose to complete follow-up to age two years in our OBOE cohort to fulfill our main study
objectives. The CHOP/PENN site has enrolled 46 infants (34 exposed and 12 controls), completing
53 MRIs across 2 timepoints thus far, contributing to the publication of multiple abstracts and three
manuscripts using OBOE data, and developing the CONSENTER intervention to improve recruitment
of exposed and control patients. For this renewal grant, we will continue progress toward our aims to:
1) determine the impact of antenatal opioid exposure on brain structure and connectivity over the first
two years of life; 2) define medical, developmental, and behavioral trajectories over the first two years
of life in exposed infants; and 3) determine how the home environment, maternal mental health, and
parenting modify trajectories of brain connectivity and neurodevelopment over the first two years of
life. Our progress so far, with enrollment completed and success in following this difficult population,
shows that we can successfully complete the objectives of the OBOE study."

 A large number of patients with infectious respiratory diseases such as COVID-19, influenza, and SARS
require respiratory support. Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NPPV) via a mask is an appropriate
treatment for many patients that can lead to better outcomes than intubation. Additionally, the equipment used
for NPPV (such as CPAP machines) is widely available, making NPPV well suited for responding to outbreaks
and pandemics. Unfortunately, NPPV masks increase the risk of disease transmission by spreading
contaminated aerosols leaking from the mask seal. This exposes health care workers and other patients to
increased risk and can hamper efforts to contain outbreaks of infectious diseases. The objective of this program
is to develop an innovative NPPV patient interface that greatly reduces the leakage of contaminated aerosols
through the mask seal. The two key innovations are a purged dual seal and a mask integrated vacuum ejector.
The dual seal captures contaminated leakage across the primary mask seal and integrated ejector provides the
purge flow required by the dual seal. All the contaminated flow is then passed through to a viral filter before
exhausting to the room. Our device is a cost effective drop in replacement for existing masks that integrates
easily with NPPV equipment used in hospitals.
 In a prior program and Phase I, we developed and tested initial PDS mask prototypes. We demonstrated
far better sealing performance than a leading commercial mask in laboratory and human subject testing. In the
proposed Phase II program we will refine and productize our mask design, extensively test the performance,
publicize the results, and prepare for regulatory clearance and commercialization. This will enable our innovative
leak-prevention mask technology to be widely deployed in critical care settings—benefiting patients and
protecting health care workers."

Ostomy surgery for intestinal diseases are performed in around 130,000 patients annually in the US.
Although currently fundamental to colorectal disease care, ostomies are associated with profound
negative impacts on the quality of life of patients, high morbidity (around 50%), and high healthcare costs.
Despite advances in the diagnosis and treatment, colorectal cancer remains the third most common
cancer with about 30-40% of cases involving the rectum. Currently, most rectal cancer patients are treated
surgically, and most will undergo temporary ostomy creation. Ostomy care, associated complications, and
reversal surgery represent a heavy added burden to patients who must already undergo difficult cancer
treatment. There exists a medical need for a technology that can safely eliminate this burden by replacing
the important function of an ostomy without the negative consequences. Savage Medical has developed
a technology that replaces the need for a temporary ostomy with a proprietary minimally-invasive medical
device that is safe, reliable, easily reversible. This technology allows for only the small percent of patients
who develop severe leaks to safely undergo delayed ostomy surgery while sparing the vast majority of
rectal cancer patients from requiring an ostomy. Savage Medical estimates that around 90% of temporary
ostomies for rectal cancer surgery can be safely avoided with this new technology. Successful
implementation of this technology would dramatically change how rectal cancer patients are treated and
has the potential to be used in a variety of both surgical and non-surgical colorectal diseases where
temporary protection of the colon from fecal flow is important to prevent severe infection or expedite
healing. This represents a combined total accessible worldwide market of >$10 billion. Eliminating the
need for a temporary ostomy would on average save around $65K per patient treated, resulting in a
potential impact of up to around $7.8 Billion on healthcare expenditures annually in the US. Although not
all temporary ostomies can be eliminated, the impact on both the individual patient and US healthcare
system are potentially tremendous. Savage Medical has successfully completed all the FDA required
testing and animal studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness, and the device has had early clinical
success in human clinical trials. The clinical trial proposed here will allow Savage Medical to further refine
clinical protocols, access use factors, and complete the final commercial design while providing valuable
clinical data on both safety and efficacy for regulatory approval and fundraising. Savage Medical has
assembled a highly experienced team of leading colorectal surgeons and clinical trial specialists to perform
the proposed human study at some of the most prestigious and well-regarded hospitals in the country.
The Principle Investigator has personally organized and led over twelve GCP clinical trials both in the US
and abroad including a large 14 center randomized-control trial. The core clinical trial team has a
combined experience of over 90 years executing FDA-regulatory clinical trials. Completion of this project
will allow Savage Medical to raise the private capital necessary for funding a future pivotal randomized-
controlled trial, gain FDA regulatory clearance, and begin commercial treatment of patients."

Vertebrates repair skin injury through two fundamental biological processes: scar formation and tissue
regeneration. Human skin generally heals with scar formation, which may cause severe emotional distress and
physical disability. One hundred million new scars appear annually in the US, and although many products are
marketed for scar prevention, their results are modest. Consequently, the elucidation of mechanisms
underlying scar formation and tissue regeneration may result in new insights with far reaching implications in
the development of therapeutics that promotes skin regeneration after wounding. Ear hole closure and wound-
induced hair neogenesis (WIHN) are two instances where adult mammals can regenerate full-thickness skin
wounds without scar formation, including hair follicles and sebaceous glands. Using both models, we
demonstrated that topical pharmacologic activation of transient receptor protein A1 (TRPA1), a receptor
expressed on skin sensory nerves promotes regeneration. This improved healing depends on dermal dendritic
cells activating γδ Τ cells through interleukin 23. Strikingly, local activation of TRPA1 promotes tissue
regeneration in distant injured areas, suggesting that a circulating factor may be induced with an
accompanying paracrine mechanism. Our results reveal a new cutaneous neuroimmune-regeneration
pathway, and a fundamental advance for the field would be a more comprehensive molecular understanding of
signaling pathways involving multiple cell types that promotes mammalian tissue regeneration. In Aim 1, we
use a combination of optogenetics, mouse models, and single-cell genomics to investigate whether TRPA1 on
skin sensory nerves is necessary and sufficient to promote tissue regeneration in our two wounding models
and to identify the molecular mechanisms of how TRPA1 expressing neurons locally activate immune cells. In
Aim 2, we use mouse models to elucidate how γδ T cells and their effector cytokines promote systemic
scarless tissue regeneration in our two wounding models. Together, our aims define mechanisms of cellular
cross talk between nerves, immune cells, and skin, and successful completion will contribute to our overall goal
of developing novel therapies to promote scarless skin regeneration in humans."

Over 150 million people are projected to be living with dementia worldwide by 2050. Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
is the most common form of dementia, responsible for ~70% of dementia cases. A hallmark pathological feature
of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is progressive neurodegeneration, which is thought to initiate and track progressive
cognitive decline in AD patients. While increasingly sensitive biochemical markers are available to diagnose AD
in individuals, treatments to stall the disease in its early stages remain elusive. Increasing evidence in AD patients
models indicates that significant accumulation of these biomarkers may be preceded by early circuit dysfunction.
A large plurality of AD patients display subclinical epilepsy. Furthermore, circuit hyperexcitability has been
observed before plaque formation in several familial AD mouse models as well, with similar findings in mouse
models of sporadic AD. Cellular evidence from these studies suggests that circuit dysregulation is due to altered
circuit inhibition from GABAergic interneurons. In particular, parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons appear
to be prone to changes in their action potential (AP) firing, and potentially neurotransmission, across distinct
familial and sporadic AD mouse models. Neurodegeneration in AD is often thought to progress through well-
defined brain regions, and interestingly, hyperexcitable circuits may accelerate this pathology. Whether
physiological changes to PV interneurons emerge first in regions of high vulnerability in AD is unclear. Our central
hypothesis is that PV interneurons will develop dysfunctional physiological deficits first in vulnerable brain regions
during early AD, which may then progress to other brain areas in a Braak-esque fashion. To evaluate this
hypothesis, which will require electrophysiological recordings from thousands of individual neurons, we will use
the PatcherBot, our robotic platform capable of performing high-throughput, automated electrophysiology of
neurons in brain slices; however, in this work, we will augment the PatcherBot’s machine vision capabilities with
fluorescence imaging to specifically target PV-expressing interneurons in brain slices. The rationale and
feasibility of this proposal are shown in preliminary work, demonstrating (1) fully automated patch clamping of
florescent-targeted interneurons using the PatcherBot, (2) brain-wide introduction of PV specific labeling and
optogenetic methods in AD mice in vivo, and (3) early-stage PV firing and neurotransmission deficits in a
prodromal FAD mouse model. Here, we will address our hypothesis across three major regions (entorhinal
cortex, hippocampus, isocortex) in 3 distinct models (APOE4, hAPP-KI, 5xFAD) and 3 relevant developmental
timepoints. Findings from this proposal will yield wide-ranging advances, including high-throughput cell-type-
specific physiology, to information regarding the potential circuit-seeding of cognitive dysfunction in early AD."
11001369,"Project Summary
The largest class of genetic alterations that cause disease are single point mutations. Most of
these disease-causing errors can be remedied if a specific adenosine is changed to guanosine
on the RNA transcript. This proposal aims to repurpose an RNA editing enzyme and direct it to
selectively edit targeted adenosines in mRNA to treat genetic disorders. The RNA editing enzyme
Adenosine Deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) can convert adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) by
catalyzing a deamination reaction on the nucleobase. Inosine is read as guanosine by the cellular
translation machinery providing the ability to alter codons in mRNA. This proposal will focus on
selectively editing disease-causing nonsense mutations, by directing ADAR to edit the adenosine
in the stop codon thus allowing the transcript to continue translation, producing functional full-
length protein. Because ADARs selectively edit adenosines in regions of dsRNA, disease-causing
nonsense mutations can be selectively targeted by furnishing an appropriate guide
oligonucleotide to create a dsRNA substrate. Canonical Watson-Crick complementarity of duplex
RNA does not produce efficient substrates for ADARs, making it challenging to design effective
guide oligonucleotides to target specific nonsense mutations. A high-throughput assay is
proposed to search all sequence space of guide RNA oligonucleotides to identify lead sequences
displaying high editing efficiency of the targeted nonsense transcript using endogenous ADARs.
These lead sequences can be further optimized by structure-guided rational design methods. The
lab has significant experience in determining ADAR-RNA structures to atomic resolution and
leveraging this knowledge to improve editing efficiency. Both X-ray crystallography and Cryo-EM
techniques are proposed for ADAR1 or ADAR2 complexed with dsRNA of the lead sequence
bound to its targeted mRNA segment. These structures will provide the basis for rational design
adjustments to develop nucleotide analogs to incorporate into guide oligonucleotides that can
fashion structural features for improved editing and increased metabolic stability. This method of
site-directed RNA editing (SDRE) to treat genetic disorders offers many advantages over current
editing tools, which often require addition of sizable proteins (e.g., CRISPR/Cas). When fully
developed, this method would permit the simple administration shorter oligonucleotides allowing
the cell’s endogenous ADARs to recode the nonsense mutation to treat many genetic disorders."

Montgomery, and Delaware counties in Pennsylvania, and Camden County in New Jersey. Philadelphia's
highly diverse population, with numerous socioeconomic, racial, and health challenges characteristic of major
northeastern cities, shapes SKCC research priorities and outreach. At any given time, hundreds of research
studies are underway at the cancer center, ranging from basic laboratory research to clinical assessments of
new treatments to meet the needs of this diverse population. Many of these studies are collaborative, involving
other cancer centers or other partners in industry and the community. The overall objective and goal of this

Despite the success of Cryptococcal Antigen (CrAg) screening and the Test and Treat policy in reducing the
prevalence of cryptococcal meningitis, it remains a leading cause of death among people living with HIV,
contributing to approximately 19% of HIV-related deaths globally. This burden is particularly high in Africa,
where roughly 73% of individuals with cryptococcosis reside. HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis is also
the most common cause of opportunistic neuro-infections worldwide, with Africa accounting for over 70% of all
global cases. While cryptococcal meningitis survivors may experience significant short-term impairment, the
long-term impact of these impairments on functional and neurocognitive outcomes remains unclear.
Additionally, the role of persistent cryptococcal antigenemia following meningitis treatment is unknown. It is
possible that persistent cryptococcal antigen could contribute to chronic CNS inflammation, a well-established
risk factor for neurocognitive disorders.
This proposal aims to determine the prevalence and risk factors for persistent neurological deficits after
cryptococcal meningitis. This research will lay the foundation for future clinical trials aimed at improving
survival and minimizing neurocognitive sequelae from HIV-associated neuro-infections. The specific aims
include:
1. To determine the prevalence of sustained neurocognitive impairment by Quantitative Neurocognitive
 Performance Z-score (QNPZ-8) among survivors of HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis at ≥1 year.
2. To identify clinical and immunologic risk factors for neurocognitive impairment in survivors of HIV-
 associated cryptococcal meningitis at ≥1 year.
A new cohort will be recruited by re-consenting 200 survivors of cryptococcal meningitis who have previously
participated in clinical trials or prospective cohorts in Uganda. Neurocognitive testing will have already been
performed at 12 weeks in these participants. We will focus on re-consenting participants to collect annual
neurocognitive outcome data thereafter. Biomarker immune profiling will be analyzed to determine whether
chronic inflammation is a risk factor for poor neurocognitive outcomes and is associated with persistent
cryptococcal antigenemia. Finally, we will compare neurocognitive outcomes between participants with
persistently elevated cryptococcal antigenemia and those with low or undetected levels.
This novel investigation into late neurocognitive outcomes, chronic inflammation, and persistent antigenemia
will address major gaps in our understanding of the complications associated with meningitis."
11000069,"Chronic viral infections are characterized by a state of T cell dysfunction that is associated with expression of
the PD-1 (programmed cell death 1) inhibitory receptor. A better understanding of the mechanisms that regulate
CD8 T cell responses during chronic viral infection is required to improve immunotherapies that will increase T
cell function and reduce viral load. We have recently identified a novel population of PD-1+ TCF-1+ virus specific
CD8 T cells that act as stem cells to maintain T cell responses during chronic infection of mice with lymphocytic
choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). The studies proposed in the application are focused on understanding how these
virus specific stem-like CD8 T cells are generated and maintained during chronic infection and how this
information can be used to develop rational approaches for optimizing PD-1 directed immunotherapy. In
particular, we ask the following questions: 1) How do these cells maintain their quiescence and the stem-like
state while living in a sea of antigen and getting TCR signals? 2) Are there any novel inhibitory pathways that
are selectively expressed by the stem-like CD8 T cells to maintain their lifestyle during chronic infection? 3) How
can we increase the number of these crucial stem-like CD8 T cells? 4) What are the most optimal PD-1
combination therapies for harnessing the full potential of the stem-like CD8 T cells? The following specific aims

expressed by virus-specific stem-like CD8 T cells in regulating their quiescence and effector cell output. Specific
Aim 2: Harnessing the potential of PD-1+ stem-like CD8 T cells for optimal immunotherapy in chronic viral

While the scale of the HIV epidemic remains large, it has entered a promising new phase, marked by
unprecedented progress and opportunities. In view of the need to rigorously test interventions to improve the
uptake, implementation, and translation of recent scientific findings into standard of care (the know-do gap), as
well as to evaluate the impact of bringing such interventions to scale, in 2014 we launched a research training
program focused on Global HIV Implementation Science. Implementation science is the scientific study of
methods to promote integration of research findings and evidence-based interventions into health care policy
and practice, thus improving equity, quality and effectiveness of health services. A key element of translational
research, implementation science encompasses a broad range of skills, including epidemiology, biostatistics,
sociology, decision science, and health economics.
The long-term objective of the Training Program is to prepare well-qualified individuals for careers as
independently-funded researchers and for leadership in global HIV implementation research. We have
assembled an outstanding group of diverse faculty from multiple schools, departments, and centers at
Columbia University as well as from highly reputable international institutions. Our Training Program faculty
have distinguished themselves in mentorship and are leading cutting edge implementation science research
addressing HIV prevention among key and priority populations, including adolescent girls and young women,
men who have sex with men, and transgender people; engaging adolescents and men in the care continuum;

11006929,"HIV disproportionately affects Black cisgender women living in the United States south threatening progress
toward the Ending the HIV Endemic initiative's 2030 goals. Although Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), an oral
or injectable medication that if taken is highly effective in preventing HIV, Black cisgender women have not
equitably benefited from its use due to multiple complex factors. For example, lack of awareness and
knowledge to PrEP, not trusting PrEP, PrEP stigma, providers not knowing about or offering PrEP,
accessibility, and cost. These factors all contribute to only 2% of eligible women taking PrEP. Thus,
interventions that take into consideration the lived experiences and broad culture for Black cisgender women
are urgently needed to take a woman from medication precontemplation to uptake to maintenance. In
partnership with Black cisgender women, an established community advisory council (CAC), an online
telehealth platform (Q Care Plus), and beauty salon stylists, the research team co-developed Using PrEP,
Doing it for Ourselves (UPDOs) Protective Styles, an e-Health intervention that strongly considers the unique
needs of Black cisgender women, consisting of a training for stylists to become opinion leaders (trusted
gatekeepers who share health information in the community) in HIV prevention (i.e., PrEP) and a 6-week web-
based, edutainment video series (i.e., six 20-minute episodes), structured debrief blogs, and telehealth service
access. The CAC was invaluable in this development process having collaborated with the research team
across sexual health-based projects that informed and contributed to UPDOs preliminary research. UPDOs
web content share core concepts by telling the stories of women from various backgrounds and role-plays a
woman's decision-making process to use PrEP. Pilot research found UPDOs acceptable, improved PrEP trust,
increased knowledge – for both PrEP aware and unaware participants, and decreased perceptions of PrEP
stigma within personal relationships. This proposed effectiveness-implementation type I hybrid study will test
UPDOs effectiveness in a larger, more geographically diverse sample using a cluster-randomized control trial
and examine implementation determinants of UPDOs. In collaboration with Q Care Plus, a secure online
platform to access telehealth services for home delivered HIV testing and PrEP prescriptions, we will track how
many women reach out to a provider, get HIV testing, start PrEP, and maintain PrEP as prescribed. A cohort of
32 beauty salons will be randomized to either an intervention group (n=16) or control group (n=16). Salons (1
salon = 1 cluster) will be randomized to UPDOs (Edutainment videos + blogs + Q Care Plus) or usual care
(CDC videos + website) conditions. Once salons are randomized, the recruitment and enrollment period of
female customers will occur over 24-months. Study participation will include data collection at baseline with
follow-up measures at 1, 12, 24, 32, and 52 weeks. To assess implementation outcomes and context, we will
use a mixed methods approach guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR)."
11007130,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The Phase I STTR grant proposal aims to address the escalating global health challenge posed by Alzheimer's
disease (AD) by targeting TAK1 as a novel drug target. Currently, there is a lack of effective therapies to slow or
prevent disease progression. Identification of new drug targets involved in the pathogenesis of AD is essential
to expand treatment options and identify therapies that have the potential to improve the lives of AD patients. In
collaboration with Dr. Jun Ninomiya-Tsuji at North Carolina State University, this Phase I STTR builds on our
foundational studies that demonstrate the therapeutic potential of targeting TAK1. Our preliminary studies shave
shown that TAK1 phosphorylation (activation of the kinase) is significantly upregulated in aged WT and APP/PS1
mice, and that conditional TAK1 knockout in hippocampal neurons significantly reduces cognitive decline in this
mouse model. Further validation in the PS19 tauopathy model showed that TAK1 KO reduced neuronal death in
the dorsal dentate gyrus, indicating TAK1 is a critical mediator of non-canonical signaling within neurons and can
regulate neuronal necroptosis in AD mouse models. These foundational observations lay the groundwork for this
Phase I STTR. Utilizing EydisBio’s patented first-in-class TAK1 inhibitors, this proposal will identify suitable TAK1
inhibitors with optimal central nervous system blood-brain barrier penetrance that can be further advanced into
in vivo testing in the PS19 mouse model. Successful outcomes of this proposal would be the identification of at
least 1 pre-clinical candidate that demonstrates optimal target product profile attributes for further advancement
into efficacy and IND-enabling safety studies using funds provided by the NIH through a Phase II SBIR/STTR
grant."

There is a critical need to develop novel therapeutics to address underserved diseases which stem from
abnormal fibrosis affecting multiple organ systems. Such diseases include Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF),
scleroderma skin fibrosis, kidney fibrosis resulting from chronic kidney disease (CKD), and intestinal fibrosis
associated with Crohn's disease. There are effectively no good therapeutics for these diseases and together
they account for over 30% of deaths worldwide. IPF alone affects 300,000 patients in the US and Europe per
year, leading to more than 50,000 deaths annually. US medical costs for IPF, excluding medications, have been
estimated to be ~$2 billion, with a lung transplant being the only effective therapeutic option. Mechanistically,
fibrosis occurs when a maladaptive complex inflammatory response to tissue vascular injury activates the TGF-
β signaling pathway, causing an upregulation of collagen I synthesis. Both FDA approved medications for IPF,
pirfenidone (Esbriet®) and nintedanib (Ofev®), inhibit TGF-β induced collagen synthesis. However, these drugs
only modestly impact disease progression, with severe side effects and low patient compliance. Adiutrix’s
academic partners recently demonstrated that collagen synthesis during fibrosis is additionally induced by an
independent mast cell (MC) mediated pathway, potentially explaining the low efficacy of drugs targeting the TGF-
β pathway. They also demonstrated that both pathways converge on collagen prolyl-4 hydroxylase (C-P4H), an
essential downstream rate-limiting enzyme responsible for the maturation of collagenous peptides into stable
collagen. Inhibition of C-P4H corrects multiple pathological problems, including restoring normal lung function in
a murine IPF model. Adiutrix is thus developing a novel anti-fibrotic compound platform to identify and
develop first-in-class therapeutics targeting C-P4H activity to treat tissue remodeling and fibrosis in
underserved diseases. Adiutrix has demonstrated a proof of concept with a compound that is safer than
nintedanib and more potent than pirfenidone when tested in primary human lung fibroblasts, and active in a
murine IPF model. In Phase I of this FastTrack Project, Adiutrix has the following Specific Aims 1) Develop 20
novel C-P4H inhibitors 2) Identify which novel C-P4H inhibitors have potential as anti-fibrotics via in vitro
screening 3) Demonstrate proof of concept of C-P4H inhibition in a representative small animal model. The
Go/No-go Criteria for Phase II is the successful identification of at least 2 compounds which show 60% reduction
of fibrosis in the bleomycin murine model of IPF. For Phase II, Adiutrix will have the following specific aims 1)
Conduct a hypothesis-driven full screen in silico search for additional C-P4H inhibitors. 2) Measure IC50 for
select compounds in primary cultures of human fibroblasts from lung, skin and intestine. 3) Validate lead
compounds as safe and effective anti-fibrotics via testing in animal models. Successful completion of these aims
is expected to lead to much needed novel therapeutics for IPF and other fibrotic diseases and lead to significantly
improved patient outcomes."

Delirium commonly plagues patients in the hospital. Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) have the highest
risks for delirium, estimated to be between 70% to 80%. The effects of delirium are profound, with higher 12-
month mortality rates following discharge, significant increases in ICU length of stay, duration of mechanical
ventilation, risk of long-term cognitive impairments, and reduced quality of life after discharge. Delirium also
leads to challenges for ICU staff including agitation and combative behavior. There are severe financial costs
from delirium as well, with higher healthcare costs per patient and an additional burden on the American
healthcare system of up to $152 billion each year. These statistics illustrate that an innovative and effective
intervention strategy to prevent delirium in the ICU is highly significant and immediately clinically
impactful. Non-pharmacological multicomponent interventions (which may include patient mobilization,
cognitive stimulation, sleep optimization, and more) have been shown to reduce the odds of incident delirium in
hospitalized non-critically ill patients by approximately half. However, such multicomponent interventions place
an additional burden on the already constrained resources of nursing staff. Technology-based interventions may
be effective intervention delivery mechanisms, but these technology interventions must be multicomponent and
not overburden staff. Crucially, an intervention must be multicomponent, can be tailored to specific patient
characteristics, targets the physical, cognitive, emotional, and social needs of the patient, and does not
overburden nursing staff. RalphVR is applying to this Phase I SBIR to achieve three Specific Aims. Aim 1:
Employ focus groups comprised of staff involved in the treatment of delirium in the ICU (N=12) and former ICU
patients (N=12) for expert, stakeholder, and patient feedback and insight to inform development. Aim 2: Develop
a framework for three innovations and develop three mind body intervention (MBI) components, then combine
these software systems into a single VR application (the Virtual PARTNER prototype). Aim 3: Run a feasibility
study targeting patients in the ICU (N=22). Three long-term objectives must be met to bring Virtual PARTNER
to market: 1) determine the safety and feasibility of Virtual PARTNER to be delivered to patients in the ICU, 2)
determine Virtual PARTNERS’s efficacy to promote target outcomes through successful delivery of MBIs, and
3) determine the efficacy of Virtual PARTNER as an intervention to reduce the occurrence of, and treat, delirium.
Successfully completing the long-term goals and aims will result in a clinically validated intervention to treat
delirium in the ICU. The proposal addresses a gap in current clinical practice and responds to the National Center
for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) program priority area of health promotion, disease
prevention, health restoration, and resilience. The proposed VR platform for patients in the ICU directly
addresses multiple NCCIH research priority areas, most notably development and testing of innovative
technologies for multisensory delivery of an MBI."

Project Title: In vivo Sickle Cell Disease Gene Therapy Using a Novel Virus Like Particle
Organization: GigaMune, Inc.
PI: David S. Johnson, Ph.D.
β-hemoglobinopathies are the most common monogenic disorders worldwide. These autosomal recessive
disorders affect the normal production of adult hemoglobin due to mutations in the β-globin gene. The two most
common diseases are: i) β-thalassemia, which is characterized by low or absent β-globin production, and ii)
sickle cell disease (SCD), in which a mutant form of β-globin is produced that results in red blood cells (RBCs)
shaped like “sickles” rather than the normal disc shape.
Gene therapies could provide life-long cures for these patients. The FDA recently approved Zynteglo, an ex vivo
manufactured cell-based gene therapy, for the treatment of β-thalassemia and is reviewing two ex vivo gene
therapies (lovo-cel and exa-cel) for β-hemoglobinopathies. Ex vivo gene therapies for β-thalassemia and SCD
remove hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from patients, edit the HSCs using lentiviral transgene delivery or
Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas gene editing, and infuse the cells
back into patients, with the goal of long-term production of healthy erythrocytes.
In vivo gene therapies are more accessible because they can be administered at most hospitals, and they do
not require myeloablation with busulfan. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and adeno-associated virus (AAV) could be
used in vivo to deliver gene therapies such as CRISPR/Cas machinery for knockout of the B-cell lymphoma 11A
(BCL11A) enhancer, but they are not cell-type specific. Conventional lentivirus is generally not immunogenic on
first dose and delivers larger payloads than LNPs and AAVs. However, conventional lentivirus lacks cell type
specificity.
We have recently used bioinformatics and high-throughput screening to innovate novel lentiviral particles for
engineering genes into T cells, achieving >95% target cell transduction efficiency and >95% cell type specificity.
The Specific Aim of this Phase I SBIR project is to test a novel lentiviral technology for editing HSCs for the
treatment of β-hemoglobinopathies. In Phase I, we will use in vitro assays to assess the efficiency and specificity
of HSC-tropic LV which deliver CRISPR/Cas9 machinery for knockout of the BCL11A enhancer versus HSC-
tropic LV for transgenic expression of anti-sickling βAS3-globin."

The high rate of failure in CNS drug discovery, in particular of the first-in-class therapeutics with new modes of
action, highlights a clear unmet need to improve the success rate in drug discovery for rare diseases and
psychiatric disorders. One well-known issue is the high cost, high risk, and low development time for drug
development, time, and costs that most of the 10,000 rare disorder patients and support organizations cannot
afford to support or wait for. Another important issue is the lack of clear targets for many for most rare diseases,
which are complex and may require polypharmacology. Phenotypic screening platforms are well-suited for drug
repurposing of drug in a target-agnostic manner. Suitable proven in vivo phenotypic screens, however, are
scarce with the exception of PsychoGenics SmartCube® platform, which has been developed in the past few
years for drug repurposing approaches using behavioral data, combining reference drugs’ signatures, and
comparing them against disease animal models’ signatures. Our aim for this Fast Track project is to create a
similar repurposing platform based on EEG data, using our eCube® fast EEG platform. To do this we will assess
in eCube® several animal models of rare disease to create a small database, increase our reference drug EEG
database, and use a novel algorithm, called Drug EEG Signature Analysis (DESA) to compare the two datasets
and generate at once a multitude of hypotheses for potential drug repurposing. These hypotheses to be
evaluated empirically using such models of disease. If our Phase I proof of concept project is successful, we will
use the Phase II period to get the platform ready for commercialization. If successful, this platform will be an
innovative and unique drug repurposing platform, offered as fee-for-service or used in drug development by PGI
and its partners."
10976774,"Project Summary/Abstract
Alcohol use is the leading risk factor for premature death among young adults globally. Brief motivational
interventions (BMIs) can help young adults reduce their drinking. However, recent research has suggested that
these interventions often have modest overall effects. Research exploring novel ways of boosting the effects of
BMIs could help expand their impact. Studies exploring why interventions based on motivational interviewing
(MI) work suggest that a key mechanism may be that they help develop a sense of discrepancy in clients, or a
sense of incongruence between their current drinking and important priorities or goals. MI counselors often
expand that discrepancy by asking open-ended questions that encourage clients to consider the inconsistency
between their current behavior and important values and life priorities. To be successful, however, these
techniques depend on clients’ engagement and investment in the exercise. Virtual Reality (VR) could provide a
method of encouraging more meaningful reflection on discrepancies between drinking and desired goals that
reduces client resistance to change. VR has been used as an adjunct to counseling to help treat a variety of
behavioral, cognitive, and mental health problems with considerable success, but very few such programs exist
to address hazardous drinking, and those that do are only fitting for those who have already decided to
change. Recently, interest has grown in using VR to create transformative experiences that inspire awe,
increase empathy, and encourage positive change. Through collaborations with local VR experts, we designed
an immersive VR experience to help develop discrepancy and elicit change talk in MI sessions that uses an
approach similar to the “looking forward” technique. We then constructed a prototype and tested it with 15
hazardous drinking young adults. At 30-days post-intervention, participants reported 54% fewer heavy drinking
days and 60% fewer alcohol-related problems. Qualitative data also suggested that the immersive nature of
the experience may have accounted for much of its impact. The goal of the proposed research is to design,
build, and pilot test a complete VR experience using user-centered design research methods and the input of
subject matter experts. In Phase 1, we will build the VR experience through an iterative process of up to five
build-test-refine cycles in which progressively more complete versions of the experience are evaluated through
several rounds of testing with intended users (hazardous drinking adults, N=15 each). Findings from these
cycles will be used to refine the experience. In Phase 2, we will test the efficacy of the completed experience in
96
young adult (age 18-34;
target N=82
) hazardous drinkers, who will be
randomly assigned to receive either
(1) BMI with VR, or (2) BMI only.
We will assess feasibility, tolerability, and alcohol outcomes over 6-months
post-intervention. Finally, we will conduct qualitative in-depth interviews with college and community addiction
treatment center directors (N=30) to explore clinic-level barriers and facilitators to implementation of VR."
10979902,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Proteasome inhibitors are currently being used in the clinic against Multiple myeloma. This
approach is thought to work at least in part because cancer cells appear to rely more heavily on
proteasomes than do normal cells. However, our previous studies showed that proteasome
inhibition invokes an adaptive program driven by the transcription factor NRF1 which
upregulates proteasome genes resulting in the recovery of proteasome activity, thus limiting the
efficacy of this approach. Consistent with this notion, our recent work suggests that depletion of
NRF1 potentiates the action of proteasome inhibition therapy in a breast cancer xenograft
model. Taking advantage of the fact that a protease DDI2 is essential for NRF1 activation, the
parent grant aims to identify small molecule inhibitors of this protease that could be used to
enhance the efficacy of proteasome inhibitors. In line with the goals of the parent grant, and
based on recent preliminary data, this supplement aims to characterize the role of the protease
function of DDI2 in proteasome inhibitor-induced proteotoxic stress response mediated by
NRF1. This will facilitate the characterization of the DDI2 inhibitors that emerge from the high-
throughput screen that is being implemented in the parent grant."

The laboratory of Dr. Joshua Lang is focused on targeting treatment resistant PCa through developing new
biomarkers for precision medical strategies using liquid biopsies; discovering novel vulnerabilities in PCa; and
translating these discoveries and biomarkers into clinical trials. Dr. Jamie Sperger has been an integral part of
Dr. Lang’s laboratory for the past 11 years and has contributed to 3 NCI funded RO1 projects and co-authored
24 publications. Together, Drs. Lang and Sperger have developed novel liquid biopsy assays which helped
identify persistent Androgen Receptor (AR) signaling in men treated with AR signaling inhibitors (ARSIs) due to
complex genomic alterations, including AR gene rearrangements, amplifications, and mutations that can be
detected in liquid biopsies. Currently Dr. Sperger leads two NCI funded projects in the Lang laboratory. The first
project “Molecular regulation of Trop-2 in advanced prostate cancer: Biomarkers and therapeutic niches”
(R01CA276269) aims to leverage liquid biopsies as a tool to better understand which patients might benefit from
Trop-2 targeted therapies. The second project titled “Enhancing epigenetic analysis of rare cells with multi-phase
microfluidics” aims to develop novel methods to detect epigenetic changes by developing new methods using
technology co-developed with the laboratory of Dr. David Beebe. Dr. Sperger is uniquely qualified to lead these
projects, with over a decade of experience with assay development for liquid biopsies using microfluidics."
10994406,"This project will characterize the functional properties of NMDA receptors that lack N-terminal and C-terminal
domains, herein referred to as minimal receptors. These proteins consist of the core machinery of NMDA
receptors and include the extracellular agonist-binding domain (ABD) connected to the ion-permeable pore
formed by the transmembrane (TMD) domain. In the parent project, we were successful in using a structural
model of this minimal receptor to envision the opening trajectory of NMDA receptors, using molecular dynamics
simulations. However, it is unknown whether the minimal receptors are functional and therefore whether they
represent a suitable model for further structure-function investigations, based on the hypotheses generated by
our simulations. In this application, we propose to investigate the hypothesis that minimal NMDA receptors
display glutamate-mediated ionotropy. Our preliminary results demonstrate that minimal receptors respond to
glutamate by producing excitatory currents that differ in kinetics from wild-type receptors. By delineating
commonalities and differences between the activation mechanism of minimal NMDA receptors and native
receptors, results from this project will provide information necessary for the correct interpretation of results
from molecular dynamics simulations."

NOX2-derived oxidative stress produced by T cells contributes to the development of maternal
syndrome in the Dahl salt-sensitive rat. Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy-specific disorder that is
characterized by hypertension and proteinuria (maternal syndrome) developing after the 20th week of gestation.
PE is the leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States, affecting about 5-7% of
pregnancies. Furthermore, women with preexisting hypertension or chronic kidney disease have an increased
risk for developing PE. With rates of PE rising in the United States, the exact mechanism(s) responsible for the
pathogenesis of the disease remain undetermined. The current notion of the pathogenesis of PE is thought to
be a two-step process: 1) improper placentation and remodeling of the spiral arteries and 2) development of
maternal syndrome. Current animal models require either a surgical or pharmacologic intervention to develop
PE-like phenotypes; however, these models are not capable of investigating the first step in the disease process.
Our preliminary data demonstrate that the Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rat is just such an animal model to help
investigate mechanisms of PE since it spontaneously develops PE while remaining on a low salt (0.4% NaCl)
diet. The present studies will test the central hypothesis that maternal syndrome in Dahl SS rats is an outcome
of improper placentation leading to the infiltration of T cells into kidney and placental tissues causing subsequent
release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that contributes to endothelial dysfunction and the development
hypertension and renal damage. To test this hypothesis, three specific aims are proposed. AIM 1 will first test
the hypothesis that T cell derived ROS (NOX2-derived) causes maternal syndrome in Dahl SS rats utilizing a
novel splenocyte transfer approach. AIM 2 will demonstrate that T-cell derived ROS results in endothelial
dysfunction that develops in maternal syndrome. Interestingly, this maternal syndrome phenotype occurs in a
divergent fashion with about 50% of SS rats developing maternal and the other half are protected. AIM 3 will
investigate the renal dysfunction that occurs during PE and the increased risk of developing chronic kidney
disease leading to increased mortality in Dahl SS rats. This maternal syndrome phenotype is consistent with
what is observed in clinical settings, and this model provides a unique opportunity to study the whole disease
process of PE. Completion of the studies in this proposal will establish the interaction between T cell-derived
ROS and endothelial function in PE to better understand the underlying mechanisms of PE."
10993807,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
RNA viruses are the leading source of existing and emerging pathogens. Many species overtake host cells
with just a dozen or so viral components, making subcellular infections tractable for mathematical modeling
and analysis. Such models have the potential to identify fragilities in a viral life cycle, examine differences in
susceptibility among humans, and serve as templates for reconfiguration in response to novel outbreaks.
However, it has not been clear how to build such models in a scalable way, and thus fewer than ten have been
developed among the several hundred RNA viruses that infect humans. A new modeling strategy was recently
proposed, which starts with a common mass-action topology that is then customized to different virus families
by parameter inference. The generic approach lumps together biochemical processes that are specific to
different virus families, and it is unclear whether these distinctions are needed to create models that are
broadly predictive. The objective of this application is to evaluate the relative merits of generic and familyspecific
approaches for modeling subcellular infection by RNA viruses. We focus on coxsackievirus B3 and
dengue virus as two species of RNA virus from different families (Picornaviridae and Flaviviridae) for which
generic and family-specific models are available or immediately feasible. The overarching hypothesis is that
RNA viruses are similarly organized around modules for entry, replication, and other core processes, but the
modules fundamentally differ by virus family. The specific aims are to: 1) Compare lumped viral entry to
family-specific modules; 2) Refactor the viral replication module; and 3) Add antiviral conduits between
modules. Our approach leverages deep transcriptome profiles from several thousand single cells and several
hundred relevant human organs; it also invokes a new abstraction (the phase-field crystal model) for a key
intermediate of RNA viruses. Computational and experimental tests will be performed using temperature as a
system-wide perturbation of biochemical rate parameters at surface (33°C), body (37°C), and febrile (40°C)
temperatures. This multi-pronged assessment across different modules will clarify a best-available path
toward building foundational models for all major families of RNA viruses that infect humans."

The development of an effective HIV vaccine has proven to be a daunting challenge. Previous strategies for HIV
vaccine design aimed to elicit protective T cell responses, non-neutralizing antibodies, broadly neutralizing
antibodies (bnAbs), or some combination of the three. All three approaches have thus far failed to consistently
protect nonhuman primates (NHPs) or humans from infection. This grant aims to elicit bnAbs by means of a
novel strategy that combines – for the first time – germline-targeting, immunofocusing and molecularly guided
affinity maturation. This study design evolves from a growing consensus that critical elements to a successful
bnAb-based vaccine will be its ability to efficiently bind and activate rare naïve B cell germline precursors of
bnAbs; to immunofocus these B cell responses to canonical, conserved bnAb epitopes on the HIV Env trimer
and away from off-target strain specific or trimer base epitopes; and to mature or “polish” this bnAb lineage
response by a process of molecularly guided Env-Ab coevolution. The study design proposed in this application
addresses each of these three essential requirements as it aims to elicit bnAbs targeting the highly conserved
HIV-1 V2-apex site. The principal investigators (Andrabi and Shaw) have assembled a talented collaborating
research team with a strong track record of scientific discovery, bioengineering and molecular tool development,
including the discovery of V2-apex bnAbs (Burton), development of germline targeted V2 apex immunogens
(Andrabi), bioengineering of phosphoserine-linked alum nanoparticle antigen displays (Irvine), discovery of V2-
apex immunofocusing chimpanzee simian immunodeficiency viruses (Hahn), creation of CRISPRCas9 knock-in
mice (Batista), development of next-generation “designer” SHIVs (Shaw) and preclinical-clinical translation
(Dey). The project consists of four aims: Aim #1 will isolate HIV envelope V2-apex targeted bnAbs from SHIV
infected rhesus macaques, identify their UCA’s, and generate UCA-expressing knock-in mouse models for
vaccine evaluation. Aim #2 will design novel V2-apex germline-targeted and immunofocused SOSIP Env trimer
immunogens and by mammalian display saturation mutagenesis and structure-guided design present them as
soluble proteins or alum-based nanoparticles for enhanced B cell responses. Aim #3 will optimize germline-
targeting and B cell immunofocusing boost strategies in V2-apex bnAb UCA-expressing KI-mice and outbred
RMs, and will identify in SOSIP Env primed and SHIV infected RMs, Env “immunotypes” that can drive
neutralization breadth. Aim #4 will design and test, first in KI mice and then in a pivotal preclinical trial in RMs,
an all-SOSIP Env vaccination regimen designed to prime, boost and affinity-mature bnAb responses in a majority
of animals. If successful, this would be the first example of a vaccine regimen that consistently elicits bnAbs in
an outbred animal model, and it would represent an important beachhead in HIV-1 vaccine science, one that
could be transitioned rapidly by our translational partner into human testing."

In low- and middle-income countries, young people with HIV (YPWH) experience the compounded effects of HIV
and poverty stigmas that jointly contribute to suboptimal mental health and HIV care continuum outcomes. Our
experience conducting research with YPWH in Zambia - which ranks among the ten countries with the highest
HIV prevalence worldwide - has revealed linkages between intersectional HIV and poverty stigmas and mental
health problems, which contribute onward to impact antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, retention in care, and
medication adherence problems among YPWH. In turn, attrition along the HIV care continuum drives high
mortality among YPWH.
Our formative work establishes the promise for microeconomic interventions with YPWH as a foundation to
improve well-being in this population of young adults experiencing the co-occurring challenges of HIV and
poverty. However, our formative work also highlights the need to address intersectional stigmas related to HIV
and poverty among young adults, in addition to providing livelihood intervention activities, as crucial components
to jointly improve the continuum of HIV care and mental health outcomes. In response to PAR-23-190, we
propose a combined intervention addressing intersectional HIV and poverty stigmas and strengthening economic
capabilities to improve HIV care continuum and mental health outcomes in YPWH in Zambia. This intervention
(tentatively named Kupambana or “to overcome”) includes an 8-week program involving two experimental
components: (i) stigma reduction support group, consisting of eight weekly group-based educational sessions
addressing self-care, health self-efficacy, resilience and empowerment, and coping strategies to minimize
internalized stigmas and (ii) vocational and entrepreneurship training (VET) voucher, worth 2,500 Zambian
kwacha [ZMW] (or ~150 USD), to pay for training fees and allow YPWH to obtain employable skills; and one
usual care component: (iii) a one-time financial literacy group-based educational session.
This application has two phases: adaptation and pilot test. Phase 1 will include interviews with ~25 YPLH and
15-20 key stakeholders and formation of a youth advisory board to inform the adaptation and implementation
process. Phase 2 will include evaluation of the feasibility, acceptability, implementation costs, and preliminary
effects of the Kupambana program on HIV care continuum, mental health outcomes, and mechanisms of change
such as stigma. We will randomly assign 100 YPWH to either experimental (Kupambana) or control (usual care)
group. We will conduct baseline, end-of-program, and two follow-up assessments at 3- and 6- months after end-
of-program. We will also conduct exit interviews to assess fidelity and implementation procedures. If this research
shows promise, we will use the findings to support a sufficiently powered R01 application to implement a type 1

During the development of heart failure (HF), especially after ischemic injury, derangements in myocardial β-
adrenergic receptor (βAR) signaling contribute centrally to pathogenesis, including signal uncoupling and
receptor desensitization leading to myocyte death and contractility defects. Waning of signaling through cardiac
βARs and other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is classically regulated via receptor phosphorylation and
internalization mediated by GPCR kinases (GRKs) and β-arrestins (β-Arrs). This is significant since the activity
of GRK2, which is elevated in myocardium after injury/stress, is pathologic in HF and its inhibition is therapeutic.
Through a long-standing collaboration, the Koch and Stamler laboratories have found that GPCRs are regulated
by nitric oxide (NO), through S-nitrosylation of cysteine to form protein S-nitrosothiol (SNO), including profound
regulation of GRK2 and of β-Arr2. Since cardiac GPCRs, including all three βARs, can activate NO synthase
(NOS) enzymes, there is a need to discover how this can promote SNO-mediated cardioprotection, especially
downstream of β2- and β3ARs. Our prior work has shown that NO from endothelial NOS (eNOS) inhibits GRK2
by S-nitrosylation at Cys340. Loss of SNO-based regulation in GRK2-C340S mutant knock-in (KI) mice leads to
un-checked and enhanced GRK2 activity, and to increased ischemic injury, and to dysfunction during aging. Our
labs have also shown that neuronal/inducible NOS (n/iNOS) activity can regulate β-Arr2 through SNO-Cys253
to maintain physiological βAR signaling in the heart. The loss of this SNO-β-Arr2 regulation in β-Arr2-C253S KI
mice leads to increased βAR desensitization and HF. Additionally, the Stamler lab recently discovered that β2AR
is S-nitrosylated at Cys265 and that this modification regulates β2AR desensitization. Together these data
suggest tightly integrated regulation of βAR/GPCR function via receptor-stimulated S-nitrosylation, which plays
a central but largely unappreciated role in controlling myocardial function. Our data provides novel insight into
consequences of the nitroso-redox imbalance in failing heart. The Central Hypothesis of this Multi-PI proposal
is that cardiac βAR signaling and desensitization via GRK2 and β-Arr2 are regulated by S-nitrosylation and that
nitroso-redox stress can be understood in terms of altered SNO of receptor, GRK and β-Arr to significantly impair
the heart’s response to injury. Specific Aims are: [1] To determine whether GRK2 inhibition via S-nitrosylation
plays a mechanistic role in selective βAR responses during cardiac ischemic injury; [2] To determine if β2AR is
S-nitrosylated in the ischemic heart and whether this impacts injury and repair; [3] To determine if regulation of
β-Arr2 by S-nitrosylation tunes βAR responses during cardiac dysfunction after injury and is integrated with β2AR
and GRK2 SNO regulation. Successful completion of these studies will illuminate the role of S-nitrosylation in
the integrated adrenergic response to cardiac injury and repair. These fundamental discoveries will reveal new
insights into the regulation of cardiac function in health and disease by defining therapeutic interventions to
promote cardioprotection, and to serve as a paradigm for signaling systems in other organs and diseases."

The leading cause of death from ages 1-44 years in the United States is traumatic injury, responsible for
millions of hospital encounters at a cost of over $4 trillion annually. Unfortunately, outcomes in trauma patients
who survive the initial injury have not seen the marked improvements observed in other fields of medicine
recently, so more research is critical. It is known that a key driver of delayed mortality after injury is organ
failure, where a marked inflammatory response and dynamic coagulopathy are both implicated. Approximately
1 in 4 patients who suffer from major trauma have a detectable coagulopathy on clinical coagulation testing,
and even more have a perturbation in fibrinolysis, a process mediated by the protease plasmin. A major
inflammatory signaling pathway in the blood circulation is called complement, a protease cascade that shares
a number of cleavage specificities with the coagulation system with increasing recognition the two processes
heavily influence one another. It logically follows that acute traumatic coagulopathy and inflammatory organ
failure may therefore be related processes, with complement-mediated inflammation being a key link. In
support of this, the extant literature has shown the degree of complement activation correlates with both organ
failure and mortality, but the primary mechanism of complement activation after trauma remains unknown. Our
preliminary results and prior work suggest that the observed complement activation may occur as a direct
result of plasmin cleavage of complement proteins, where plasmin is known to be generated in large amounts
in trauma patients with severe shock. In addition, we also know that after trauma the vascular endothelium
sheds its glycocalyx into the circulation, which may serve to activate complement via the lectin pathway, which
is a complement activation pathway that binds to specific glycans and causes robust complement activation.
To further elucidate the mechanism of complement activation after trauma, we are now proposing 3 Aims. In
Aim 1, we propose a focused protein and glycan biomarker investigation of plasma from human trauma
patients to test whether plasmin generation or circulating endothelial glycocalyx molecules correlate with
degree of complement activation. In Aim 2, we will use a human endothelial cell culture model designed to
mimic traumatic shock to elucidate whether plasmin, endothelial glycocalyx molecules and the lectin pathway,
or both are capable of generating robust complement activation in the absence of other complement pathways
to delineate relative contributions and mechanism of activation. Finally, in Aim 3, we will directly investigate the
role of complement in generating organ failure in trauma using a mouse model of trauma comparing mice
deficient in complement proteins C3 and C5 with wild-type mice. The results of this Aim would highlight the
potential role of anti-complement therapies for future clinical study considerations. Taken together, this
research program will improve our understanding of the mechanisms of complement activation and
inflammatory organ injury after trauma in this leading cause of death in the United States."

11002810,"Project Summary/Abstract
Caries is a multifactorial disease that results from an imbalance between the microbiome and the host, leading
to demineralization and destruction of the dental hard tissues. The etiology of caries attributes lesion progres-
sion to diet- and pH-dependent processes. However, the specific mechanisms resulting in the degradation of
dentin are unclear and have been thought to be mediated exclusively by enzymes from bacteria. New evidence
is challenging this concept of advanced caries pathology by suggesting that host-derived enzymes, such as
matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) that become activated by changes in the pH, primarily drive the tissue break-
down. Recent data indicates that dentin destruction and the response of the dentin-pulp complex to bacteria
invasion in caries involve complex enzymatic machinery. Indeed, fundamental questions remain concerning
the regulatory mechanisms that drive MMP expression and activation and how these mechanisms are modu-
lated by bacterial infiltration as caries lesion advances. The parent award will address these issues by (a) filling
the gap in knowledge regarding the breadth of the contribution of specific MMPs to caries lesion progression,
(b) defining the role of odontoblast-produced and dentin-released MMPs in caries, and (c) determining how the
shift in the oral microbiome can modulate MMPs expression and/or activation as the lesion progresses. The
knowledge generated in the parent award will provide essential baseline information to facilitate the PI’s long-
term research goal, which is the development of new dental therapies based on the modulation of MMP activity
in caries to stimulate dentin and pulp repair. This new therapeutic approach will be based on selective inhibi-
tion of damaging endogenous mechanisms and promotion of repair mechanisms that would fundamentally
change the way dentin caries are managed and surgically treated. In addition, a comprehensive career devel-
opment plan integrates the research aims with the training activities to allow the PI to achieve the following
short-term goals: (1) to acquire advanced knowledge on dentin organic matrix composition and biochemical
properties in health and caries disease, (2) enhance experience with methodologies for the study of oral pro-
teins and microorganisms in caries, including genomics and proteomics, and (3) develop skills in leadership
and scientific communication including writing, oral presentations and mentorship. However, the progress of
the parent award was impacted by a critical life event, which delayed the research and career development
activities and impacted reaching some of the milestones planned mainly for years 2 and 3 of the parent award.
This administrative supplement will support the PI in continuing her career trajectory and returning to full
productivity. Achieving the outcomes proposed for the parent award will be essential for the PI to transition to
her next career level, sustain a robust research program, increase scientific productivity, and ultimately miti-
gate the impact of the critical life event in her career development."

For this project, we propose a type 3 hybrid implementation-effectiveness randomized controlled trial (RCT)
comparing two strategies that engage the social networks of current PrEP clients from communities with high
HIV incidence to extend the reach of HIV self-testing (HIVST) and PrEP. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness,
resource needs (including cost) and implementation factors of Test-to-PrEP, a strategy in which current PrEP
clients directly distribute HIV self-tests (HIVST) and PrEP resources to their social network contacts, and a
comparison social network referral strategy without direct distribution of HIVST. Building on successful pilot
testing of the Test-to-PrEP strategy through two Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) Supplement Projects, our
team, supported by the Florida Department of Health, community partners Prevention305, and the
Implementation Science Coordination, Consultation, and Collaboration Initiative (ISC3I), seeks to conduct this
trial in Miami-Dade County, Florida—a region with a one of the highest rates of new HIV diagnoses in the
United States and an EHE priority areas. The trial encompasses two key components: (1) strategically located
sites in priority neighborhoods for HIV prevention, ensuring diverse representation of Latino and Black PrEP
client participants, and (2) the use of social networks for disseminating HIVST and PrEP information.
Participants (N=320 PrEP client egos) will be recruited at clinic sites, with randomization by clinic block to one
of the two social network strategies being evaluated. Utilizing the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption,
Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation
Research (CFIR), the study will assess the reach and implementation of each strategy and identify contextual
factors associated with success including cost and resource requirements. Effectiveness will be evaluated
based on completion of HIVST among social network alters, changes in PrEP knowledge, and PrEP or HIV
treatment initiation. Both strategies aim to overcome structural and socio-cultural barriers by using trusted
networks, specifically engaging PrEP clients to provide social network support and resources for accessing
PrEP/HIV treatment. Understanding the effectiveness and resource requirements of these two strategies will
inform their adoption in other EHE priority areas, contributing significantly to the broader efforts to combat the
HIV epidemic."

Despite the significant advances in HIV antiretroviral therapies for effective treatment and prophylaxis
regimens, young Black men and transwomen in North Carolina (NC) continue to be affected by HIV at nearly
the same rates over the last 10 years. The new diagnosis rate in NC for Black men aged 13-24 years was
104.7/100k population in 2009 and 114.6/100k population in 2019. Viral suppression failures lead to higher
rates of uncontrolled HIV in the sexual networks of young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM).
YBMSM who are HIV-negative are significantly less likely to be on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), especially
in states which have not or have only recently expanded Medicaid.
There are both clinical and public health points of intervention where YBMSM could be given greater access to
PrEP. Clinical guidelines indicate PrEP based on individual-level risk factors (e.g., bacterial diagnosis) or on
partner-level risk factors (e.g., HIV+ partner). However, YBMSM are more likely to be part of a sexual network
where both HIV and bacterial sexually transmitted infections are circulating. If using the concept of “degrees of
separation”, YBMSM in the US South tend to be fewer degrees away from someone with HIV, so accounting
only for their person-level or first degree partner-level risk factors fails to place the person in context. Clinically,
an understanding of the partners of the partners may turn out to be an indicator for PrEP that is not currently
assessed. From a public health standpoint, PrEP can benefit not only the person taking it but also the larger
community if preventing one person’s infection also protects future partners. It can thus have a positive effect
across the sexual network, as has been demonstrated by simulation studies. As resources to provide PrEP are
extremely limited, identifying network members who would themselves benefit from PrEP and whose partners
would benefit as a result is key.
These gaps suggest that to better assess HIV risk – and recommend prophylaxis – an understanding of risk
within the entire sociosexual network is needed as the individual-level risk is a product of the local network
beyond just partners. In this project, we aim to quantify the additional risk of HIV among YBMSM who are
positive for syphilis or who are partners of someone positive for syphilis compared to the risk among other
demographic groups and to develop a model that can be applied at the time of the public health interview to
predict HIV seroconversion within 3 years. We also aim to test methods to scale up to the underlying
transmission network using the subset of relationships which are observed during public health interactions."

Over 455k cardiac procedures annually rely on chest tubes to drain blood from surgical wounds. However, dated
chest drainage technologies result in significant issues—36% of tubes clog with blood, leading to complications
in 17% of patients due to incomplete drainage. Hospitals spend approximately $9,617 per patient on these
complications, totaling a yearly economic burden surpassing $2B in the US alone. The current practice of milking
and stripping chest tubes is both labor-intensive and potentially risky, often leading to missed clots that
compromise tube patency and patient adverse outcomes.
CirculaTech’s ThoraFlush is a proactive clot preventing chest tube which utilizes proprietary dual irrigation
technology to sustain drainage patency. ThoraFlush integrates seamlessly with hospital IV pumps to irrigate the
chest tube with saline, obviating the labor-intensive manual manipulation, and automating chest tube
maintenance. ThoraFlush saves nurses time and effort in maintaining chest tubes, reduces hospital costs linked
to tube blockages, and promotes faster, smoother patient recovery with fewer complications.
This NIH proposal will complete the following AIMs: 1) Optimize ThoraFlush’s efficacy of drainage patency in a
mediastinum blood coagulation model (MBCM). 2) Sustaining ThoraFlush’s drainage volume in an in vivo model,
superior than the standard of care.
In AIM 1, the team will use an in vitro bench top mediastinum blood coagulation model, known as the MBCM to
produce a functioning ThoraFlush prototype. The MBCM is hypothesized to be more rigorous than clinical
practice due to its use of hypercoagulable porcine blood and mediastinal model geometries/materials promoting
accelerated blood clot formation. Achieving a 6 hour benchmark of retaining device patency will prove
significance to move to conducting AIM 2.
In AIM 2, the team will translate their work in Aim 1 to animal testing using male Yorkshire Breed pigs to assess
ThoraFlush's efficacy in live animals. The study involves a simulated heart surgery, replicating common cardiac
procedures. This approach aims to comprehensively evaluate ThoraFlush's performance in a relevant
physiological context. This model also proves as a first of its kind, mediastinum in vivo model for post-surgical
recovery.
Ultimately, the outcomes of this proposal will develop and prove that ThoraFlush meets patency requirements in
the MBCM and show’s superior performance in an in vivo study, promoting its next stages into commercialization
of the device."

Youth with mental health and behavior disorders have been underserved for decades, and many children
receive no services at all. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for effective mental health treatments for
children and families has increased substantially, with research suggesting that 25% of children and
adolescents now report levels of depression in the clinical range (Raccine et al., 2021). For most children,
schools are the primary delivery source for mental health and behavioral treatments, yet schools have been
adversely impacted by a lack of providers and limited funding to support vulnerable students. Efficacious
treatments for mental health problems in children typically involve support for families to improve student
behavior at home, yet schools lack the tools to deliver this support. To meet this need, we developed the
Family Check-Up Online, a digital health intervention designed to improve child mental health through family-
centered intervention. The Family Check-Up is grounded in over 25 years of evidence-based research and has
been shown to improve child mental health and behavior including depression and conduct problems. We were
supported by an SBIR Phase I award (R43MH132191) to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the digital
health product in schools and adapt the product based on our findings. Our findings suggested the model is a
good fit for schools, with school providers stating a need for family-centered interventions that target child
behavior and mental health, but with few resources or evidence-based programs available. We received
feedback that suggests the model should be evaluated as both an uncoached version and coached version,
delivered with provider support. In our proposed SBIR Phase II, we plan to continue our work in schools to
develop the model for commercialization, including understanding the process for embedding the FCU Online
into current student support systems and implementation factors that lead to maintenance of the model in
schools. We plan to conduct a hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation trial to evaluate the effectiveness of
the FCU Online when delivered by real world providers. We will randomly assign 30 providers (N=600
students/families) to receive training in the FCU Online coached vs. uncoached models. We will then evaluate
outcomes including family relationships, parenting skills, and child mental health and behavior. We predict that
the FCU Online will improve child mental health and behavior, and we will test for moderators such as provider
training and child baseline risk. Findings will have implications for commercialization of the product in schools
and implementation of the model in a range of different school settings."
10999649,"PROJECT SUMMARY. The prevalence of parasitic helminth infections is estimated at two billion individuals
infected worldwide. Many helminths migrate through the lung as part of their developmental cycles and as a
result promote substantial lung damage and tissue fibrosis. Our studies and those of others have shown that
alveolar macrophages (AMs) with an alternatively activated or M2 phenotype are critical regulators of these
responses. Alveolar macrophages are the most abundant immune cell in the parenchyma of the lung and play
diverse metabolic and immunoregulatory roles that are needed to maintain lung function. Despite their
importance, the molecular mechanisms that regulate AM activation and their M2 responses remain to be fully
defined. Gaining a better understanding of the factors that regulate AM activation could reveal novel
therapeutic targets to treat diverse forms of lung inflammation including fibrosis. Our new studies have
shown that the enzyme carbonic anhydrase 4 (Car4) is a lineage-identifying feature of AMs. Carbonic
anhydrases are a family of enzymes that are traditionally known for their ability to regulate pH and CO2
homeostasis. However, our published studies have recently identified that Car enzymes also play important
roles in regulating immune cell activation and antihelminth immunity. Therefore, we sought to investigate
whether Car4 regulates the phenotypes and functions of AMs. To test this, we generated a novel Car4-floxed
mouse to selectively delete Car4 in AMs. Importantly, mice with Car4-deficient AMs (Car4-AM-/- mice) exhibited
spontaneous induction of M2 and profibrotic pathways and presented with features of altered lipid metabolism
and increased hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling. To further investigate the role of Car4 in regulating the
M2 activation of AMs we infected Car4-AM-/- mice with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (Nb), a parasitic infection
that promotes robust M2 responses and lung pathology. Importantly, Car4-AM-/- mice infected with Nb exhibited
dramatically elevated M2 responses, increased lung fibrosis and suffered from significantly reduced oxygen
levels. Collectively, these data provoke the hypothesis that Car4 regulates the metabolism of AMs in a manner
that restricts M2 activation and tissue fibrosis. This hypothesis will be tested in the three Aims. Aim 1 will focus
on the importance of HIF-associated pathways in regulating the bioenergetic state of AMs and their
M2/profibrotic phenotype. Aim 2 will investigate the role Car4 plays in regulating M2 activation and pulmonary
fibrosis in the context of helminth-induce inflammation. Aim 3, will investigate whether Car4 also instructs the
activation of newly seeded monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages that populate the lung post-Nb infection
and acquire an M2 phenotype. Gaining better insight into these pathways may lead to the development of new
therapeutic strategies to treat lung disease and tissue fibrosis."

 Platinum drugs such as cisplatin serve as a mainstay of cancer therapy, but resistance limits their curative
potential. Through a kinome-wide RNAi screen, we identified microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase 1
(MAST1) as a main cisplatin resistance driver in human cancers and identified lestaurtinib as a promising MAST1
inhibitor. MAST1 was found to reactivate the MEK1 pathway, conferring cisplatin resistance. However, we do
not know how this pivotal factor, MAST1, is activated, expressed, and associated with oncogenic mutations.
 Through a proteomics study and mutational analysis, we identified aurora kinase B (AURKB) as an upstream
kinase that phosphorylates MAST1 at S1258, critical for MAST1 activation. Our transcription factor study
revealed that the transcription factor CEBPb is responsible for MAST1 gene expression, and wildtype p53 inhibits
the activity of CEBPb to induce MAST1. In line with this observation, TCGA analysis revealed that MAST1
expression is high in lung cancer patients with mutant p53. These data suggest that AURKB and p53/CEBPb
may regulate MAST1 in transcription-independent and -dependent manners.
 Recently, cancer has been indicated as a metabolic disease and altered unique metabolic properties of
cancer cells make cancer metabolism an attractive target in treating cancers. However, the link between MAST1
and cellular metabolism has never been explored. Through real-time cell metabolic analysis and metabolomic
profiling, we found that MAST1 elevates glucose uptake and controls redox metabolism when cells are exposed
to cisplatin. We noticed that MAST1 is involved in the gene induction of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and
peroxiredoxin 2 (PRX2). Furthermore, MAST1 directly phosphorylates c-myc at S62 and may stabilize c-myc,
the potential transcription regulator of GLUT1 and PRX2. These preliminary data suggest that MAST1 may play
a critical role in the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells. To further benefit from the MAST1 therapy, we
performed a kinase inhibitor synergy screen and identified the combination of lestaurtinib and ponatinib as an
optimal combinatorial strategy to overcome cisplatin resistance. Moreover, lestaurtinib with BAY-876 (GLUT1
inhibitor) synergistically enhanced cisplatin sensitivity in various cancer cells.
 Our central hypothesis is that MAST1 modulated by AURKB and CEBPb provides metabolic advantages for
cancer cells to confer cisplatin resistance; MAST1 signaling axis linked to AURKB/CEBPb and GLUT1/PRX2
represents a promising cisplatin-sensitizing target. Three specific aims are proposed: (1) To determine how
MAST1 is regulated by AURKB and p53/CEBPb; (2) To decipher the mechanism of how MAST1-c-myc-GLUT1
and PRX2 signaling confers metabolic advantages; (3) To evaluate the optimal MAST1-based combinatorial
strategy in treating cisplatin-resistant cancers."

11004217,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
ADHD is the most common early childhood diagnosis, affecting around 9% of US children. LemurDx is a software
system that uses state-of-the-art sensor technology to measure hyperactivity. LemurDx passively collects data
from smartwatch sensors which are transmitted to a HIPAA-compliant server. Machine learning (ML) algorithms
are used to assess context (a combination of activity and environment) using multi-level classification to first
identify the wearer's class of activity, then contextualize the level of motion, and evaluate activity level based on
that context. Context (e.g., classroom versus playground) is critical to differentiate children with clinical vs normal
levels of hyperactivity. LemurDx is superior to research-focused tools such as traditional actigraphy in a number
of ways. Beyond the improved precision afforded by modern smartwatch sensors and ML algorithms, we are
designing an integrated system to address clinical trial needs. LemurDx has the potential to improve the process
of medication titration and outcome assessment in ADHD clinical trials by providing investigators with rapid
feedback and an objective outcome measure. In this project, we will test the utility of LemurDx to measure
changes in hyperactivity in children on days when they are on versus off medication in standardized and real-
life settings. This pilot data will allow us to test the utility of LemurDx as an objective measure of hyperactivity to
measure response to medication and help investigators assess medication efficacy in clinical trials. This SBIR
(R44) project will accomplish two aims over two phases. Aim 1 is to refine the LemurDx product to enhance ease
of use among clinical researchers, including the automated collection, cleaning, and feature extraction of
wearable sensor data, the ML processing pipeline, and an updated smartwatch app. Aim 2 is to test LemurDx in
100 children (ages 6-11 years) with ADHD-Hyperactive Type or Combined Type who are prescribed stimulant
medication on days when they are on versus off medication, both in real-world and standardized lab settings.
We will refine the ML algorithms to detect the presence and severity of hyperactivity. We will iteratively test and
refine LemurDx’s ML algorithms to improve its generalizability and to achieve high sensitivity and specificity in
estimating hyperactivity severity. We will use these insights to design a scalable clinical delivery system.
LemurDx innovations include a readily available and reliable measurement technology combined with accurate
ML algorithms to objectively measure hyperactivity and its context in a system that is intentionally designed to
meet the needs of clinical trial investigators. We will demonstrate the commercialization potential of LemurDx by
validating the feasibility of using LemurDx to measure medication response in children with ADHD-Hyperactive
Type or Combined Type and the acceptability of the system to ADHD clinical investigators."

US women living with HIV (WLHIV) on antiretroviral therapy (ART) face a three-fold risk of myocardial
infarction (MI) compared with women without HIV. Further, among WLHIV who present with MI, the majority
(56%) present with type 2 MI – oxygen supply/demand mismatch in the absence of atherothrombosis. Data
suggest that coronary microvascular dysfunction and excess epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) volume represent
salient processes relevant to type 2 MI risk among WLHIV. Our team aims to identify novel salutary
interventions. We propose a randomized controlled trial assessing the effect of sodium glucose transporter 2
(SGLT2) inhibitors on cardiac PET-derived coronary flow reserve (a CV risk surrogate reflecting the ability to
augment blood flow through large and small coronary arteries) and cardiac CT-derived EAT among WLHIV.
SGLT2 inhibitors, originally developed to treat DM2, work by blocking renal sodium/glucose reabsorption,
leading to glucosuria, as well as reduced glomerular perfusion pressure. Kidney- and cardio-protective effects
of SGLT2 inhibitors led to approval for use in CKD and heart failure, even among those without DM2. SGLT2
inhibition has been shown to improve coronary flow reserve and EAT in some patient populations but not
others. The observation that effects are population-specific highlights the need for testing among at-risk
WLHIV. Notably, newly published work from our group suggests SGLT2 inhibitors are rarely prescribed to
PLHIV with clinical indications in a large US healthcare system: <9% of PLHIV with DM2 and <4% of PLHIV
with DM2 and CKD. Randomizing WLHIV with a clinical indication (DM2, CKD, or both) to either SGLT2
inhibitor therapy + health education or health education alone x 24 weeks, we will: 1) Characterize effects of
SGLT2 inhibition on coronary flow reserve; 2) Characterize effects of SGLT2 inhibition on EAT; 3) Assess
whether changes in coronary flow reserve and EAT are predicted by baseline values of and/or associated with
changes in key kidney, metabolic, inflammatory parameters. Our central hypothesis is that SGLT2 inhibition +
health education vs. health education alone will result in a relative increase in coronary flow reserve and
reduction in EAT. Our work will likely identify a viable strategy to increase coronary flow reserve and reduce
EAT among WLHIV at risk for type 2 MI. Because this strategy is clinically available but underutilized among
WLHIV, evidence on favorable population-specific effects will be particularly informative. If SGLT2 inhibition
increases coronary flow reserve and/or reduces EAT among WLHIV, our work will yield mechanistic insights
into whether improvements relate to changes in kidney, metabolic, and immune/inflammatory parameters.
Even if SGLT2 inhibition yields disappointing results, our identification of novel factors associated with decline
in coronary flow reserve and/or increase in EAT among WLHIV will suggest alternate strategies to improve
these indices relevant to type 2 MI risk in this population. This clinical-translational trial will thus advance
cardiometabolic health among aging WLHIV."
11005684,"Background: The transition to a skilled nursing facility (SNF) after an acute hospitalization is one of the most
perilous times in the life of an older Veteran. Veterans undergo more than 250,000 transitions between
hospitals and SNFs annually, but more than 1 in 4 is readmitted to the hospital from SNF and less than half
have returned to the community by 100 days following hospital discharge. Although the intent of SNF care is
to allow recuperation and rehabilitation, Veterans who do not successfully recover are commonly placed in
institutional long-term care at significant cost to themselves and to the VA, which spends more than $7 billion
annually on this care. However, SNFs vary widely in their rates of community discharge and costs of care
delivered. It is unclear how to identify “high-value” SNFs (those that deliver the best community discharge rates
at lowest cost) for Veterans since existing public quality metrics do not include VA SNFs, do not list Veteran-
specific outcomes, and do not include costs. Similarly, it is unclear how much matching individual Veteran
needs with particular SNF characteristics might improve value. The VA as both payer and provider of SNF
care has the unique opportunity to develop an optimal SNF network to drive high-value care.
Significance/Impact: This work aligns with VA priorities to develop an integrated, high-performing network for
Veterans as part of the MISSION Act and positions the VA as a leader in delivery of post-acute care. There
are more than 4 million Veterans currently over age 65, making it imperative to improve outcomes and lower
costs in SNFs as more Veterans transition out of the hospital to this care setting.
Innovation: The approach uses novel data sets and methods drawn from health economics, big data, and
systems engineering to provide new insights. To our knowledge, there are no published studies describing the
outcomes of Veterans in post-acute care, identifying characteristics of high-performing facilities, nor
establishing how matching patient to post-acute care provider characteristics affects outcomes.
Specific Aims: Our Specific Aims are to:
 1) Compare outcomes (successful discharge to the community) and costs (Federal dollars) across the
 population of Veterans discharged from a VA hospital to the three most common post-acute care
 settings where Veterans receive SNF care: CLCs, CNHs, and non-VA SNFs.
 2) Evaluate the effect of matching individual subpopulations of Veterans (e.g., by risk for adverse
 outcome) to SNF type (CLCs, CNHs, or non-VA SNFs) and SNF star rating on outcomes and costs.
 3) Compare the effects of consolidating SNF referrals to the SNF type with best outcomes and lowest
 costs (Aim 1) or matching individual Veteran characteristics to different SNFs (Aim 2) on Veteran
 outcomes, overall costs of care, and SNF capacity.
Methodology: This proposal uses advanced statistical techniques (such as instrumental variable and machine
learning methods) and a unique dataset (the 2014-18 Residential History File, which concatenates VA, fee-
basis, Medicare, and Medicaid data into longitudinal episodes of care for individual Veterans) to accomplish
our Aims.
Implementation/Next Steps: The results of this work will be disseminated to VA Geriatrics and Extended
Care and Office of Community Care leadership, who have been involved in the development of the proposal,
as well as VISN and VA facility leadership through two tools that can be used 1) at the bedside to optimize
SNF choice and 2) at a leadership level to help shape the SNF network to maximize value."
11004741,"SUMMARY: Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common cancer diagnosed in children younger than one year old
and is the most frequent solid tumor in children < 5 years of age. Those with high-risk disease have only a 40-
50% survival rate. For locally advanced and metastatic disease, high-dose chemotherapy is the primary modality
of treatment. Irradiation of the primary tumor bed is commonly undertaken after surgery for those with the MYC
proto-oncogene family that encodes basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor N (MYCN) amplified tumors,
correlated with high-risk cancers and poor prognosis. Despite the introduction of immunotherapies, the five-year
survival remains below 50%. NanoPharmaceuticals LLC is developing a novel dual targeting ligand for the
treatment of high-risk NB through a combination of a plasma membrane integrin αvβ3 antagonist and uptake of
a metabolically stable norepinephrine structural analogue via high norepinephrine transporter (NET) expression
typical of NB and other neuroendocrine cancers. BG-P-TAT is our novel chemical entity containing triazole tetrac
(TAT), a derivative of L-thyroxine, and benzylguanidine (BG), covalently bound to a 1600 MW polyethylene glycol
(PEG), P1600-TAT. P1600-TAT has a substantial panel of anticancer actions (antiproliferation, pro-apoptosis, anti-
angiogenesis) mediated by its binding to integrin αvβ3, a plasma membrane protein preferentially expressed and
activated by cancer cells. BG binds to the norepinephrine transporter (NET) expressed on the surface of
neuroendocrine cells, conferring additional binding affinity and tumor specificity. Our in vivo studies of tumor cell
targeting showed that BG-P1600-TAT (NanoPharma 855: NP855) had 70-95% tumor shrinkage in two cell lines.
This Direct to Phase II SBIR will establish IND-enabling therapeutic efficacy and safety of NP855 following scaled
up manufacturing. Aim 1. Evaluation of efficacy and PK of NP855 using scaled up product. The objective
is to confirm in vitro and in vivo efficacy in NB cells and tumors following scaled up manufacturing of non-GMP
drug material. Tasks include (1.1) Production of NP855 following process transfer, analytical evaluation, lab
demo batch production, and reference standard qualification; (1.2) In vitro confirmation of integrin binding affinity
and NET engagement by measuring uptake kinetics in NB cells versus normal cell line; (1.3) In vivo evaluation
of anti-cancer efficacy (tumor growth, NP855 tumor uptake, tumor histopathology for cancer viability and anti-
angiogenic efficacy using anti-CD31 tumor immunostaining) and PK in mice. Goals: (a) Production of 500g of
drug substance for formulation of the drug product (DP) with reference standard qualification; (b) Confirmation
of efficacy findings using scaled up DP. Aim 2. Perform IND-enabling toxicology evaluations. We will conduct
non-GLP (14 days) and GLP (28 days) dose range finding and repeated dose studies in rodent (rat) and non-
rodent (minipig) as well as in vitro assessments of solubility, stability, protein binding, transporter and cytochrome
inhibition. In vivo central nervous system, respiratory, and cardiovascular assessments will be completed. Goal:
Establish safety and toxicokinetics for NP855 in two species for IND preparation."

Advances in learning health systems (LHS) and implementation science have great potential to address barriers
to equitable genetic medicine. We bring together 4 MPIs and a team of investigators with expertise in learning
health systems; implementation science; and cardiovascular and cancer genetic medicine to advance our
Northwestern genetics-enabled learning health system (Northwestern gLHS). We will design, implement, and
continuously refine strategies to enhance equitable genetic medicine among diverse populations. We are ideally
suited to conduct this work for the following reasons. First, Northwestern is a leader in developing an LHS with
equity-focused systems solutions that are continuously refined to improve both healthcare delivery and health
outcomes. Northwestern's established LHS resources and expertise will support our clinical site and the national
gLHS network. These resources and expertise integrate our robust clinical, genetic, and patient-reported data
capabilities, institutional and community-based electronic health records, and novel web-based tools and
technologies to fully realize the promise of the gLHS. Second, Northwestern is a leader in genetic medicine as
a member of the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) consortium and has recruited and
effectively integrated genetic results into Northwestern's EHR as discrete, computable lab values enabling
effective clinical decision support. Third, Northwestern's recent investment in senior implementation scientists,
coupled with an established environment of community partnership with AllianceChicago, a network of federally
qualified health centers, and Alliance for Research in Chicagoland, a network of community-based non-profit
agencies, is poised to lead in implementing and disseminating genetics-enabled healthcare. Our Specific Aims
include: 1. Bring together our expertise in learning health systems, implementation science, and genetic medicine
to advance our Northwestern gLHS to accelerate the equitable impact of emerging genetic evidence in real-
world clinical settings within our health system and community settings. 2. Collaborate with the national network
to co-design, implement, and evaluate harmonized projects to create generalizable knowledge that accelerates
genetic-based equitable healthcare and improved health outcomes. We propose 3 projects on cascade genetic
testing (CGT) for hereditary conditions within cardiovascular disease and cancer as our use case. Our proposed
projects each address a different aspect of a primary barrier in CGT, over-reliance on probands to transmit the
importance of CGT to family members. 3. Develop and disseminate gLHS methods to ensure our learnings with
regard to equitable evidence-based genetic medicine can be scaled across real-world healthcare settings. The
Northwestern gLHS methods and tools will guide future wide-scale implementation of CGT and other evidence-
based genetics practices within health systems and the community while answering important questions related
to equitable implementation of genetic medicine to improve health for all."

Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation (HSCT) after conditioning is widely used in the clinic to treat pathological mutations in the lympho-hematopoietic system. The mechanisms on how the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment (ME) and transplanted HSC interact remains a mystery in biology. Understanding the underpinning mechanisms controlling mesenchymal BM-ME and HSC is arguably a major area of interest to optimize HSCT and generate optimal HSCT protocols that result in complete hematopoietic chimerism in the host with minimal or no myeloablative conditioning therapy. Our published data indicate that mesenchymal-lineage MSC undergo massive damage to their mitochondrial function following irradiation. Donor healthy HSPC transfer functional mitochondria to the stromal ME, thus improving mitochondria activity in recipient MSC. Mitochondrial transfer to the mesenchymal-lineage MSC is cell-contact dependent, positively regulated by mitochondrial connexin-43 (Cx43) and negatively regulated by cytosolic adenosine monophosphate kinase activity. In this proposal, we hypothesize that mitochondrial transfer from HSPC to BM stroma depends on the activity of Cx43 to control mitochondrial dynamics and downstream mitotransfer and is required for hematopoietic recovery during BM regeneration. The goal of this proposal is to identify the mechanisms by which Cx43 controls HSC mitochondrial dynamics and elucidate in detail the cellular and molecular mechanisms of mitochondria transfer from HSPC to BM MSC. We will identify the mechanisms by which Cx43 controls mitotransfer and regeneration and the role of mitochondrial Cx43 functional domains in mitochondrial dynamics, mitotransfer and hematopoietic regeneration. This proposal is the continuation and natural consequence of the NIDDK R01 DK124115 designed to start the exploration of the role of Cx43 as a regulator of hematopoietic metabolism and regeneration."

PERSON-CENTERED RESEARCH on CULTURE AS HEALTH (PERCH)
 An Indigenous Model of Wellness
Abstract. Native American (NA) youth in the Bemidji area grapple with the opioid epidemic's harshest consequences, experiencing a devastating 68% rise in opioid-related deaths since 2019 (GLITEC, 2021). The COVID-19 pandemic further compounded this crisis, with opioid-related deaths spiking by 33.5% between 2019 and 2020. These alarming rates of substance use among NA youth stem from underlying mental health issues fueled by historical trauma, unresolved needs due to long-standing social inequalities, and the broader social determinants of health. In response to this urgent crisis, the Great Lakes Inter-Tribal Council (GLITC) has conducted extensive research and is pioneering the Adolescent Recovery Wellness Center (ARWC), a first-of-its-kind residential facility for youth aged 13-17 struggling with substance use disorder (SUD) and co-occurring mental health conditions. From the beginning, GLITC's focus has been on the development of a Person-Centered approach and integration of Tribal wellness practices. The N CREW HEAL initiative fuels this development of a research program named Person-centered Research on Culture as Health (PERCH). The three AIMS are to build capacity to engage in research: 1) Establish and register the GLITC Institutional Review Board (IRB); 2) Plan for long-term success and sustainability through development and demonstration of culturally appropriate and effective recovery and treatment services for NA youth; and 3) Establish a culturally specific Healthcare Model to sustainably support NA Youth with SUD and other co-occurring Mental Behavior Health conditions. GLITC’s plan is to operate the ARWC to address the unique health challenges faced by native youth, and stands as a symbol of resilience, strength, and the profound impact of integrating traditional and modern pathways to healing and wellness. Through this innovative approach & methodology, the ARWC’s operational plan will include a Cultural Competency Framework for treatment and an Indigenous Evaluation Framework that uses mixed methods statistical approaches to build a Convergence of Evidence Model demonstrating traditional wellness practices are effective and therefore should qualify as billable healthcare services. The Outcomes are integration of traditional health practices to strengthen cultural connectivity, improve mental behavioral wellness, and reduce risky behaviors in NA youth. Related wrap around services in tribal communities will integrate a compassionate Person-Centered healthcare model culturally defined and evidence-based to reduce SUD in NA youth."

In-person behavioral weight loss (WL) programs are the gold standard of obesity treatment, but remote-based
interventions are becoming increasingly utilized as they overcome barriers common to in-person programs
(e.g., geographical, time, and travel constraints) and represent a more translatable intervention model. Yet,
remote WL interventions can vary substantially, and questions remain regarding which type is most effective
and whether there are certain groups of individuals who respond best to one type over another. For example,
our fully automated, online program produces a 4.5% WL on average and about half of participants achieve a
WL ≥5%. While this low-touch intervention is effective for many, others have limited success and may benefit
from a different type of remote intervention (e.g., group-based videoconference program, resembling in-person
treatment) or more individual support (e.g., via coaching). This trial utilizes a 2x2 factorial design to compare
two remote-delivery formats (automated online program vs. group-based videoconference program) and the
added effect of coaching (vs. no coaching) on 12-month WL. Direct comparisons of these approaches have
been limited. From a personalized medicine perspective, it is also important to understand for whom each
remote approach should be recommended. Thus, an additional aim is to develop two algorithms which could
be used to refer patients into remote WL programs. The ‘widely-applicable’ algorithm will use metrics common
to electronic medical records (sex, BMI, age, race, ethnicity), and the ‘more comprehensive’ algorithm will
further include additional baseline characteristics (e.g., education, household income, health literacy, group
preference, etc). Participants will be randomized at baseline (out of 4 possible combinations) and receive a 12-
month, remote-based behavioral WL program. All programs include daily self-monitoring of diet, exercise, and
weight and the provision of automated feedback. Those receiving the online program will also be instructed to
view video lessons (24 in total, 10-15 min each) which focus on behavioral strategies for changing diet and
exercise. Individuals randomized to the videoconference program will participate in 24 group sessions (1 hour
each) designed to mimic in-person treatment and allow for participant interaction via large and small group
discussions. Coaching calls (10-15 min each) will be monthly and focus on individual barriers, problem solving,
goal setting, and fostering support and accountability. Assessments will occur at baseline, 6 (mid-treatment),
12 (post-treatment), and 18 months (following 6 months of no intervention). Secondary aims will examine the
effects of delivery format and coaching on intervention engagement (e.g., frequency of self-monitoring),
psychosocial outcomes (e.g., perceived support, self-efficacy, and motivation), 18-month WL, and the cost per
kilogram of WL (to examine whether the addition of human support is cost-effective). Study findings have the
potential to inform patient referrals and insurance coverage decisions for remote WL treatment."
10979605,"Sepsis is a major cause of organ failure and death in both children and adults around the world for which there
are no specific therapies other than antibiotics and supportive care. A major reason for the lack of targeted
therapies is our incomplete understanding of the genetic, environmental, microbial, socioeconomic and biologic
factors that underly risk of and outcomes from human sepsis and that drive heterogeneity within this clinical
syndrome. We propose to create a unique resource, the Sepsis ClinicAl Resource And Biorepository
(SCARAB), a two center prospective study in adults and children with sepsis and critically ill controls that is
designed to be both comprehensive and scalable to large multicenter implementation. To create this resource,
we will leverage our experience with large scale prospective observational studies in the ICU, our novel
method of non-invasively sampling the distal airspace in mechanically ventilated patients, our world class
bioinformatics expertise, state-of-the-art phenotyping methodologies, and unique institutional resources.
SCARAB will prospectively enroll subjects from pediatric and adult ICUs at VUMC and Meharry Medical
College, an institution that cares for a primarily minority population. Subjects will be enrolled early in their
illness and serial biologic specimens of blood, DNA, respiratory micro-droplets (from Heat Moisture Exchange
(HME) filters), tracheal aspirates and urine will be collected. To study the end organ most commonly injured in
sepsis, we will establish best practices for collection, processing and storage of lung fluid collected from HME
filters, a novel method for sampling the distal airspace in ventilated patients. Working with our collaborators in
Biomedical Informatics, we will develop automated phenotyping algorithms to identify patients with sepsis and
organ failures including ARDS, AKI and delirium. We will use cutting edge natural language processing
methods such as concept mapping to conduct detailed sub-phenotyping for clinically important variables that
are challenging to phenotype on a large scale, such as hyper- and hypoactive forms of delirium. SCARAB will
also be linked to unique VUMC resources such as MicroVU which retains clinical isolates of all microbial
specimens at VUMC allowing large studies of host-pathogen interactions using contemporary multi-omics
approaches. SCARAB clinical data and biospecimens will be accessible to the broader research community
through an application on our web based study portal. Proposals will be reviewed by a Resource Utilization
Committee comprising study investigators and national experts in sepsis and organ dysfunction. Data will be
de-identified using the most rigorous security standards. SCARAB is also designed to be readily accessible to
early career investigators by providing statistical support, customized phenotyping and access to Studios for
expert engagement for study design. Bringing together all of these innovative elements will allow for
mechanistic studies, development of predictive biomarkers, understanding of pre-hospital factors and clinical
outcome studies in patients with sepsis and appropriate controls at a scale not previously possible."
10979823,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The brain is able to form learned associations between stimuli and the rewards or punishments they predict,
which then guide appropriate behavioral responses to maximize survival. However, responses to
environmental stimuli are severely altered in neurological disorders such as anxiety, depression, and post-
traumatic stress disorder, leading to damaging behavioral outcomes. Understanding the neural circuits which
mediate learned associations and motivated behavior is therefore of crucial importance both from a basic
science and human health perspective. The amygdalostriatal transition zone (ASt) has circuit connectivity
which suggests a role in these processes, but the function of this region is almost completely unknown. The
central hypothesis of this proposal is that the ASt acts as a parallel circuit to the amygdala to mediate
associative learning and behavioral responses. In the mentored phase (K99) experiments, a combination of
optogenetics, in vivo electrophysiology and advanced computational analysis will be used to identify
subpopulations of neurons in the ASt that encode stimulus information and specific behaviors. The
independent phase (R00) experiments will determine the contribution of inputs from the thalamus, cortex and
lateral amygdala to ASt activity encoding cue information, and determine whether synapses from these
projections onto ASt neurons are strengthened in associative learning. Preliminary data for this study show that
1) genetically distinct populations of ASt neurons have opposing responses to cues predicting rewards or
punishments, and 2) optogenetic inhibition of one of these populations results in a striking reduction in
conditioned fear responses. This suggests that the ASt may indeed play a critical role in behavioral responses
traditionally attributed to the amygdala. A successful outcome of this proposal could therefore result in a major
conceptual revision of current models of the circuit mechanisms underlying associative learning. The study will
also provide new insight into the long-standing open question of how significant behavioral responses to
conditioned stimuli still persist even following bilateral loss-of-function manipulations targeting the amygdala.
This will not only increase our fundamental knowledge of the circuits underlying motivated behavior, but could
also identify ASt circuits as vital new targets of interest for neurological disorders where normal behavioral
responses to stimuli are disrupted. All proposed research will be conducted Dr. Fergil Mills in the lab of Dr. Kay
Tye at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, which is fully equipped for the proposed experiments. The
proposal also includes a comprehensive training plan to facilitate Dr. Mills's career development, and will
prepare him to direct an innovative research program as an independent investigator studying neural circuit
mechanisms underlying normal and pathological behaviors."

Sex is a major factor affecting survival from life-threatening infections, but current treatment alternatives do not
provide sex-specific care. To discover novel strategies to treat severe infections, I wish to unravel sex-specific
mechanisms of the liver that improve host fitness during infections. My central hypothesize is that sex-specific
factors of the liver impact the survival of infected mice, and I wish to target these factors to improve survival
rates.
During my postdoctoral training, I have developed mouse models that replicate human responses to infections
and found that housing infected mice at their thermoneutral temperature better mirrors infected humans than
housing mice at ambient room temperature. My recent studies demonstrate that housing infected mice at
thermoneutrality compromises the survival of female mice as compared to males, and this is due to a dramatic
accumulation of plasma triglycerides. My further data demonstrate that this is regulated by a hepatic transcription
factor, BCL6, which targets hepatic lipoprotein metabolism to mediate its critical function in systemic lipid
handling. In my K99 Aim1, I will start testing candidate factors that function downstream of BCL6 and are novel
regulators of host fitness during pathogenic infections. I will continue studying systemic lipid handling following
infection in my K99 Aim 2 and perform VLDL synthesis and clearance assays to understand the mechanism of
infection-induced hyperlipidemia in mice.
After the K99 training phase, I wish to establish an independent research laboratory in one of the major
institutions in the United States to study sex-specific metabolic adaptations in the liver that impact the outcome
of infections. I aim to expand this question during the independent R00 phase and identify hepatic factors that
predispose men to NAFLD. My exciting new studies suggest that while hepatic BCL6 protects males during
infection, the opposite occurs when male mice are fed with high-fat diet. There, hepatic BCL6 predisposes males
to fatty liver and hepatic steatosis. In my R00 Aim, I wish to study this as an independent investigator, but I need
further training in sex steroid metabolism and hepatic gene manipulation before independence. The NIH Pathway
to Independence Award will allow me the two years of critical training to develop these skills in Dr. Holly
Ingraham’s lab. In her lab, I will develop the skills needed for my independent career, and her passion in
mentorship will be invaluable for my training before establishing my independent research group."

Older adults account for over half of new cases of melanoma each year, but healthcare providers face
significant challenges when deciding on appropriate treatment for these patients. Evidence is limited on the
benefits and harms of treatment for older adults with melanoma because they were underrepresented in recent
landmark clinical trials in melanoma. Effective shared decision-making is also needed to elicit the unique
preferences of older adults and provide personalized treatment recommendations, but healthcare providers
routinely fail to understand patient preferences when practicing routine shared decision-making. The
combination of uncertain evidence and ineffective shared decision-making leaves older adults with melanoma
vulnerable to over and undertreatment. In this setting, older adults with melanoma would benefit from
improving the quality of evidence and implementing effective shared decision-making.
“Improving decision-making for older adults with melanoma” is a two-year R03 that responds
specifically to AG-24-047 for “transdisciplinary aging research that will yield pilot data and experience
for subsequent aging research projects.” This proposal serves the long-term goals of aligning treatment
decisions with patient preferences, maximizing use of beneficial treatments, and minimizing unwanted or
ineffective treatments for older adults with melanoma. The objective for this proposal is to inform and adapt the
“Better Conversations” framework for shared decision-making for older adults with melanoma. This project has
two aims: Aim 1, to characterize healthcare trajectories of older adults with melanoma to inform the discussion
of goals and downsides of treatment in the “Better Conversations” framework; Aim 2, to adapt the “Better
Conversations” framework for treatment discussions with older adults with melanoma.
The results of this proposed work will guide treatment discussions for older adults with melanoma. Upon
completion of this study, we will be well-positioned to perform a pilot study evaluating an intervention to teach
melanoma oncology providers to use the adapted “Better Conversations” framework for older adults with
melanoma."

The expression levels of protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) are significantly elevated in cancer cells
and are associated with poor clinical outcomes. This strongly suggests their potential as a novel class of
therapeutic targets in oncology. Major pharmaceutical companies have developed over ten selective and potent
PRMT inhibitors (PRMTis) that are currently in early-stage clinical evaluation. However, due to the understudied
nature of arginine methylation as a post-translational modification, a comprehensive mechanistic understanding
of PRMT functions in cancer is urgently needed to enable the clinical application of these inhibitors. Notably,
recent clinical trial results indicate that the activity of PRMTis alone may be insufficient for effective cancer
management in patients. Therefore, it is imperative to conduct mechanism-driven preclinical evaluations of
combination strategies that target PRMTs alongside other therapeutic drugs to achieve clinical success. Both
high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) share clinical and
genomic characteristics such as poor prognosis, homologous recombination deficiency, and potential
immunoreactivity. Given the urgent unmet medical need to develop effective therapeutic strategies for these
diseases, our preliminary studies have merged large-scale drug combination screening and cancer genomic
profiling to establish a strong rationale for applying PRMTis in treating HGSOC and TNBC. Our hypothesis is
that because of uncontrolled proliferation, increased DNA damage, and activated oncogenes, cancer cells must
sustain abnormal levels of transcription, splicing, and protein arginine methylation through enhanced PRMT
activities (PRMT addiction). Treatment with PRMTis can disrupt the hyperactivated PRMT-regulome that enables
cancer cells to survive. We've assembled a team of investigators with diverse expertise and resources to test
this hypothesis through three specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Characterize molecular mechanisms of PRMTi mono-
and combination therapies; Specific Aim 2: Evaluate therapeutic potentials of PRMTis in HGSOC and TNBC
preclinical models; and Specific Aim 3: Investigate effects of PRMTi treatments on anti-tumor immune responses.
The overarching objective of this application is to systematically explore the dynamic changes in the regulome
induced by PRMTi treatments in cancer cells. This will offer fresh insights into their mechanisms of action and
provide a rationale for the clinical development of PRMTi mono- and combination therapies in the field of
oncology."

The great advances made in genomic medicine that impact diagnoses and care of newborn babies in large
academic centers in Texas are generally not available at most level III and level IV NICUs across the state. Major
populations in predominantly Hispanic regions such as El Paso and the Rio Grande Valley lack local access to
medical genetic expertise, capacity for genomic testing, and frontline practitioners with the knowledge to leverage
personal genomic data to improve care. Residents in these remote areas must travel over 300 miles to reach
the nearest in-state geneticist. Only twenty years ago, less than three percent of genetic conditions in newborns
could be molecularly diagnosed. Today, with routine genomic tests at academic medical centers, over one third
of these cases are diagnosed. Unfortunately, many babies born outside of these privileged communities lack
access to genetic evaluation and testing, remain undiagnosed, and are unable to benefit from early personalized
medical treatment. Here, we propose to dramatically improve the diagnosis of the sickest newborns in hospitals
across underserved regions of Texas using a new generation of clinical assays (whole genome and RNA
sequencing), leveraging a lower cost sequencing technology and Consultagene, our established remote
consultation service and platform. This combined approach (MAGNET) will improve access to care, reduce
health disparities, increase the scale and quality of the genomic data generated at reduced cost for the ethnic
minority newborns, and advance personalized care. Moreover, we propose to make these diagnostic strategies
available through a telehealth-based approach expanding access to medical genetics expertise while improving
patient and provider engagement and education, at both academic and community neonatal intensive care units
across Texas. This strategy will greatly democratize genome technology, enhancing access in geographically
remote, poor, underserved, and minority communities, and reaching a much larger proportion of hospitalized
newborns. As such, our work will serve as a model for providing genetic diagnoses in an equitable fashion amid
diverse communities in NICUs across the United States."

The goal of this STTR Phase I application is to establish the feasibility of commercializing a personalized and
multi-targeted adoptive T cell therapy (ATCT) for glioblastoma (GBM). GBM is the most common primary brain
tumor with a dismal prognosis and relative five-year survival rate of 7.5%. There has been no significant
improvement in outcomes for these patients in two decades. In response to this urgent need for novel
therapies for GBM patients, we have developed a personalized, autologous ATCT targeting multiple antigens
in GBM unique to each patient. We envision administering the ATCT as an adjuvant therapy directly into the
tumor bed through an Ommaya reservoir after standard-of-care surgery. Our strategy for generating a GBM-
specific ATCT involves applying Prussian blue nanoparticle-based photothermal therapy (PBNP-PTT) to GBM
cells ex vivo. During PBNP-PTT, PBNPs are administered to GBM cells that have been excised via surgery,
and a near infrared laser is shone onto the mixture ex vivo, thereby generating heat. Under certain conditions,
PBNP-PTT delivers a thermal dose that elicits immunogenic cell death (ICD) in GBM cells and facilitates the
release of GBM-specific antigens unique to each patient. The PBNP-PTT-treated GBM cells are then co-
cultured with autologous dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells, to expand GBM-specific T cells for subsequent
infusion back into the patient. Importantly, this platform is designed to develop multi-targeted T cells in an
antigen-agnostic manner. Since this approach uses a patient’s own tumor as the source of T cell targets, it
does not require a priori chosen antigens. Our published data illustrates the feasibility of our novel ATCT
development platform using PBNP-PTT to generate potent and functional GBM-specific T cells against two
GBM cell lines, U87 and SNB19, using healthy donor PBMCs HLA-matched to the tumor cell lines. In another
published study using an orthotopic U87 xenograft model, we have demonstrated that our ATCT is more
effective in generating in vivo tumor regression and long-term survival relative to alternative and control
ATCTs. Building on these published results, in this STTR Phase I study, we seek to establish the feasibility of
developing autologous GBM-specific T cells with our PBNP-PTT-based platform using blood and GBM tumor
samples from patients. Our overall hypothesis is that PBNP-PTT-treated GBM cells facilitate the generation of
potent and personalized GBM-specific T cells in an antigen-agnostic manner that exert specific cytotoxicity
against autologous patient-derived GBM cells in vitro and in vivo. In Aim 1, we evaluate whether PBNP-PTT-
mediated ex vivo expansion generates potent and effective patient-derived GBM-specific T cells and define the
mechanisms driving the observed responses. In Aim 2, we test the efficacy of the PBNP-PTT-derived T cells in
GBM patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models in vivo compared to other T cell approaches (e.g. B7-H3 CAR T
cells). Successful completion of these studies will demonstrate the feasibility of manufacturing autologous
patient-derived GBM-specific T cells using PBNP-PTT for their use in ATCT."

hepatitis C virus (HCV), and opioid use disorder (OUD). Yet uptake of these HIV-related evidence-based
interventions (EBI) remains distressingly low in populations that could benefit from them the most, notably
people who inject drugs (PWID).Three structural limitations of current health delivery practices must be
addressed to improve PWID access to HIV-related EBI: 1) the fragmented nature of the US healthcare system
that forces PWID to seek care for infectious diseases and OUD from different entities; 2) the prohibitive
administrative burdens of social programs such as Medicaid and Ryan White (complex eligibility requirements,
burdensome paperwork); and 3) severe stigma toward PWID in healthcare settings that leads to care
avoidance and poor retention in care. We propose an intervention that co-locates telehealth in syringe service
programs (SSP) to improve uptake and retention of two key EBI, PrEP and MOUD. Because their practices are
rooted in harm reduction principles and provide supplies that PWID routinely use, SSPs maintain strong client
follow-up and offer many points of entry into care. Telehealth offers a more cost-effective, adaptable, and
scalable model than in-person care, and recent service advances have generated a strong knowledge base for
remote delivery of HIV-related care. Our intervention will further address administrative burdens by placing
case managers on site to ease administrative burden, and by providing our telehealth providers with an
evidence based stigma reduction training pioneered by our team. Our work will take place in four SSP sites
across Minnesota which is currently experiencing an outbreak of HIV across racially and regionally diverse
communities of PWID. Aim 1. Conduct formative research on determinants of HIV and addiction among
racially and regionally diverse PWID to inform design of a co-located telehealth program. We will conduct in-
depth interviews with N=25 PWID and N=10 advocates from PWID-facing organizations. We will also develop
a tailored stigma reduction training for partnering providers using our proven experimental audit approach. Aim
2. Develop an integrative, low-barrier, low-stigma telehealth program for urban and rural PWID informed by
Aim 1 findings and input from PWID and providers. Share back of Aim 1 findings will be conducted with 3
advisory boards (rural PWID, urban PWID, providers) to enlist their insights in the design of the stigma
reduction training and key features of the telemedicine program. Aim 3. Pilot a telehealth intervention in
racially and regionally diverse SSPs to assess feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact. Uptake and
retention of PrEP and MOUD will be tracked for 6 months in 80 PWID across 4 SSPs (2 rural, 2 urban).
Feasibility and acceptability will be informed by process indicators (enrollment, uptake, retention) and exit
interviews. Preliminary impact will be assessed through a pre-post comparison of electronic medical records
(EHR) from a state-wide data sharing platform."
11001332,"Project Summary/Abstract
Substance use disorders (SUD) of many highly addictive drugs affect more than 100 million people worldwide.
Genetic variations associated with complex neuro-behavioral traits, such as drug addiction, are likely to impact
enhancers which have a high degree of cell type-specificity and can be conserved across species. Furthermore,
variation in addiction behavior has been linked to genetic variation in both human and rodents. Thus, it follows
that genetic mechanisms driving addiction behavior, specifically at cell type-specific enhancers, might also be
conserved between primates and rodents. I hypothesize that risk variants for some SUDs may lie in enhancers
of distinct cell types in the reward areas and not others, providing insight into the cell types that are critical to
SUDs. This project proposes to identify the gene markers and putative enhancers of cell types that are conserved
or clade-specific to primates and rodents and of these, which are enriched for SUD human genetic risk variants.
The proposal comprises of the following aims: Aim 1: identify the primate-rodent conserved cell types and marker
gene profiles enriched for human SUD risk variants. Aim 2: identify the primate-rodent conserved putative
enhancer profiles to test whether mouse substance use behavior risk loci disrupt similar putative conserved
enhancers to human SUD risk loci. Together, these experiments could reveal primate-rodent gene and enhancer
atlas of conserved and species-specific cell types of the reward system by integrating single-nuclei genomics
data across multiple mammalian species. This information is critically important because better understanding
of how an individual’s genetic makeup could affect the cells of the reward circuit will inform future work to craft
personalized, targeted SUD therapy. Thus, this work integrates closely with my clinical interests in addiction
medicine. This proposal outlines a combination of rigorous mentored research training, longitudinal clinical
experiences, coursework, and professional and leadership development activities. The intellectual, technical,
and professional skills refined during this fellowship training period will be instrumental in my development as an
aspiring physician scientist in the clinical field of addiction medicine."
11008887,"The Phase II SBIR project by ActioX LLC builds on the success of Phase I, aiming to revolutionize the field of
precision nutrition through the development of a state-of-the-art microneedle-based wearable sensor platform.
This technology is designed for the concurrent monitoring of critical biomarkers: glucose, ketones, and sodium.
These biomarkers provide essential insights into an individual's metabolic state, facilitating personalized
healthcare interventions. Our long-term goal is to create an integrated ""lab-under-the-skin,"" a miniaturized
wearable sensor that offers continuous, minimally invasive monitoring of a wide array of nutritional and metabolic
parameters. To this end, we plan to integrate advanced data analytics into our mobile application, enhancing the
predictive power of health recommendations derived from biomarker data. In this phase, we are setting specific
aims to refine and validate our multi-analyte sensor, enhancing its accuracy, usability, and data fidelity. Aim 1
focuses on the development of a multimodule printed circuit board (PCB) that combines potentiometric and
amperometric measurements, enabling the precise quantification of our target analytes. This PCB is to be
complemented by an FDA-compliant mobile application, ensuring secure and real-time data transmission and
analysis. Additionally, we aim to scale up the production of microneedle sensors using semi-automatic
manufacturing processes. This step is crucial in transitioning from manual production methods to a more scalable
and economically viable model, ensuring consistent quality and performance of the sensors. We will conduct
rigorous biocompatibility testing, adhering to FDA standards, to verify the safety and comfort of users. This is an
essential milestone toward regulatory approval and commercialization. Aim 3 is centered on conducting a series
of feasibility clinical studies to establish a unified calibration algorithm for our sensors, eliminating the need for
individual recalibrations. This factory-calibration approach is anticipated to streamline the user experience,
making the technology accessible to a broader population. Our research design incorporates a methodical
approach to sensor optimization, combining in-vitro and in-vivo studies. Clinical trials are designed to validate
the multiplexed sensor's performance in real-world settings, capturing a diverse range of human physiological
responses to diet and lifestyle. The anticipated outcomes of this project include a miniaturized, FDA-compliant,
multimodule sensor platform with a robust mobile application, a scalable production process for microneedle
sensors, and comprehensive clinical validation of a multiplexed wearable device. By achieving these aims, we
will enable real-time, individualized monitoring of key biomarkers, empowering users to make informed decisions
about their health and dietary practices. The foundational work from this phase will establish the groundwork for
a comprehensive, user-friendly ""lab-under-the-skin,"" propelling precision nutrition forward and paving the way
for enhanced health outcomes and disease management across diverse populations."
11007332,"Developing effective and safe therapeutics is critical to our quality of life, and novel approaches are
needed to improve the speed and accuracy of detection biological contamination and other quality control

itoring and gating of biological contaminants in water and therapeutic supplies. The main objective of this
SBIR is to create a neural network-accelerated DNA and RNA sequence processing node suitable for ﬁeld, clinical,
and industrial use, making it of great utility to monitoring efforts aimed at tracking and assessing potential haz-
ardous exposures, as well as highly marketable to a wide range of end-users. In order to demonstrate technical
feasibility, QBI will perform these Speciﬁc Aims:
Speciﬁc Aim 1: Develop neural network NGS data processing routines for mapping, assembly, and
analysis in edge applications. DNA and RNA sequence analysis, which is core to a number of biologi-
cal contaminant monitoring techniques but is also core to QBI's recent nanobody library technology, has
traditionally has been reserved for servers and other capable computers, but neural network approaches
have enabled modern edge computational platforms to perform sophisticated analyses outside of central
servers. We seek to develop two proof of principle neural networks that accelerate two sequence analysis
routines central to sequence analysis on edge platforms, which will permit distributed and cost-effective
execution of sequence analysis in remote contexts. The error tolerance of neural networks will be espe-
cially useful, since nanopore sequencers with relatively high sequence error rate are becoming a common
edge technology due to their ability to sequence samples with minimal hardware and with minimal pre-
processing of sample.
Speciﬁc Aim 2: Develop and demonstrate CLEdgeSeq node as a solution for distributed NGS data
processing. These neural network tools will be combined with data format speciﬁcations and network
communication routines to establish feasibility of a computational node, CLEdgeSeq. CLEdgeSeq will
pre-process NGS data at the point of sequencing, perform necessary analyses, assemble consensus se-
quences, and then relay the results to a central server in a bandwidth-effective manner. The resulting
platform will be a distributed computing approach to NGS data activities that should scale well with
the expected rapid rise of NGS data generation from point-of-production and point-of-care sequencers,
especially including nanopore sequencers.
 Successful completion of these Aims will serve to validate modern neural network approaches to sequence anal-
ysis for edge hardware, making it of great utility to monitoring efforts aimed at tracking and assessing potential
hazardous exposures. Creating this computational capability will be transformative, since it will provide
a cost-effective and scalable solution to ubiquitous DNA and RNA sequencing for monitoring and other
efforts. This will enable QBI to continually expand their customer base as they continue to add sensing
capabilities tailored to meet end-users' needs.

 Daily and intermittent/2-1-1 pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) options are promising to end the HIV epidemic
among transgender (trans) women — including in the Philippines where the HIV case infections recently doubled
(1560 cases in 2022 vs. 714 in 2019) within a short timeline in this population.1,107 Understanding end-user input
and preferences of PrEP via behavioral economic approaches like conjoint study designs are vital to maximizing
its effectiveness such as feasibility, acceptability, and sustainability across its care continuum. However, to our
team’s knowledge, no conjoint design studies have been applied to examine trans women’s end-user
preferences for PrEP, including the co-use of gender-affirming hormones. Moreover, the socio-ecological
barriers/facilitators pertinent to influencing PrEP uptake across the personal, social, economic, and structural
levels are underexamined among trans women. As such, along with this study’s Trans Stakeholder and Scientist
Advisory Board, this proposal aims to inform and test a future behavioral economic-based intervention to support
PrEP engagement among trans women, with the following aims: (1) To qualitatively explore and identify all
preferred and accepted attributes and features of PrEP needed to inform a full-profile PrEP program choice-
based conjoint survey study via in-depth interviews with 30 trans women and 15 key informants (i.e., HIV
specialists, primary care providers, PrEP programmers/policymakers), and (2) To quantitatively test and
determine optimal combinations of attributes predictive of Filipinx trans women’s acceptability and preferences
about PrEP modalities via full-profile choice-based conjoint study design with 300 Filipinx trans women to
enhance implementation outcomes (e.g., acceptability, feasibility) of future intervention, and examine socio-
ecological factors that may influence the chosen optimized PrEP program preferences. Findings will provide pilot
data insights to test the identified optimized PrEP program profile(s) via a future larger scale (R01) behavioral
economic-structural strengthening intervention for Filipinx trans women to increase PrEP uptake and reduce HIV
incidence in the Philippines."
11005864,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Kaposi’s Sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) causes the AIDS-defining cancer Kaposi’s Sarcoma (KS).
How KSHV infection causes KS is poorly understood, primarily due to a lack of a rigorously defined primary
human cell culture model that recapitulates the transformed features of the KSHV-infected tumor cells in KS.
KS tumor cells most likely originate from microvascular lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). LECs, therefore,
represent a physiologically relevant model for studies of KS. We have developed a protocol for KSHV infection
of primary human LECs that allows us to measure KSHV-induced loss of contact inhibition of proliferation
(CIP). Loss of CIP is a feature of oncogenic transformation in solid tumors. Based on these data, our central
hypothesis is that the KSHV-mediated deregulation of cellular gene expression triggers the oncogenic
transformation of LECs, which recapitulates KSHV-mediated oncogenesis in KS. This proposal, therefore, aims
to identify KSHV-induced genes that promote the KSHV-induced loss of CIP in KLECs. We also aim to
determine if KSHV-infected LECs (KLECs) are fully transformed and form xenograft tumors in immunodeficient
mice. To test our hypothesis and achieve our objectives, we propose two Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, we
will conduct sub-genomic CRISPR screens to identify which KSHV-induced human genes promote KSHV-
induced loss of CIP in KLECs. Specific Aim 2 will determine whether KLECs are fully transformed and can form
xenograft tumors in immunodeficient mice upon subcutaneous or subrenal implantation. We will assess
resulting tumors for the expression of viral and cellular markers of KS to determine how closely KLEC tumors
model KS. The proposed study is innovative because our model provides a set of rigorously defined
experimental settings that enable oncogenic changes after KSHV infection of a primary human cell type
relevant to KS. This work is significant because it will identify KSHV-induced cellular genes that promote these
changes and establish whether KSHV-infected LECs are fully transformed and tumorigenic in mice.
Furthermore, results will be impactful because they may enable mechanistic insights and provide proof of
concept that KLECs undergo oncogenic transformation. Results would also establish a well-standardized
primary human cell-based model of KS in vitro and, likely, in vivo. Such a model would enable countless
studies of the roles of viral and cellular genes in KSHV-mediated tumorigenesis, the identification of KS
biomarkers, and the pre-clinical testing of therapeutic approaches."
11006602,"The goal of therapeutic vaccination is to increase host immune control of HIV-1 to achieve durable virologic
control in the absence of ART, which is defined as a “functional cure”. However, therapeutic vaccine studies in
humans have to date been largely unsuccessful. We speculate that this may reflect the fact that prior vaccines
(i) have failed to induce sufficient breadth of cellular immune responses and (ii) have not effectively activated or
targeted the latent viral reservoir. We hypothesize that a therapeutic vaccine that induces potent and broad
immune responses and that activates the latent viral reservoir will reduce the size of the replication-
competent viral reservoir and will enhance virologic control following ART discontinuation.
We have shown that Ad26/MVA therapeutic vaccination together with innate immune stimulation with a TLR7
agonist resulted in virologic control in a subset of SIV-infected rhesus monkeys following ART discontinuation.
We therefore propose to evaluate the immunogenicity and efficacy of the Ad26/MVA + TLR7 agonist vaccine in
HIV-1-infected humans to define its ability to control viral replication following discontinuation of ART.
We also hypothesize that the addition of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) may augment the antiviral
efficacy of a therapeutic vaccine. To optimize both active and passive immunity, we propose a follow-up study
to evaluate the optimal therapeutic vaccine together with bNAbs in HIV-1-infected humans.
We therefore propose the following two Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1. To evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of Ad26/MVA therapeutic
vaccination with TLR7 agonist administration in HIV-1-infected humans
Specific Aim 2. To evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of Ad26/MVA therapeutic
vaccination with broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) and a TLR7 agonist in HIV-1-infected humans"

In the United States, at least 1 in 10 pregnant people experience a cardiometabolic disorder of
pregnancy each year such as a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (HDP; 6-8%) or gestational
diabetes (GDM; 2-10%). Either diagnosis is associated with increased risk of maternal morbidity
and mortality, poor infant outcomes, and long term increased risk of cardiometabolic disease.
Non-Hispanic Black and low-income women face a higher risk of cardiometabolic disease
during and following pregnancy compared to non-Hispanic white or higher income women. Only
part of this difference can be explained by medical risk factors or access to care. Theory and
limited evidence suggest that experiences of stress and trauma, including from racism across
the life course, increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes and cardiometabolic disease
in later life. However, evidence is limited, particularly during pregnancy and postpartum. Thus,
the overarching goal of this study is to understand how stressful and traumatic experiences
across the life course are embodied in women’s cardiometabolic health during and following
pregnancy. To do this, I will use data from two existing cohorts, the Grady Trauma Project,
based in Atlanta, and CARDIA, and prospectively collect data from pregnant and postpartum
women within the EmPOWR data registry, based in Atlanta. The specific aims of this project are
to: (1) Estimate the direct and indirect effects of lifetime trauma on cardiometabolic disorders of
pregnancy (HDP and GDM). (2) Estimate the effect of risky childhood family environment on (a)
incident gestational diabetes (b) changes in cardiometabolic function following childbearing. (3)
(a) Describe trajectories of cumulative life stress and (b) estimate the effect of distinct
cumulative life stress patterns prior to pregnancy on postpartum weight loss. (4) Estimate the
effect of cumulative life stress prior to pregnancy on lactation and sleep duration postpartum.
The primary training experience will be to develop expertise in the measurement and analysis of
early indicators of cardiometabolic dysfunction in women and the modeling of changes in
metabolic biomarkers over time during both the K99 and R00 phases. The research and training
will be supported by an interdisciplinary mentorship team led by Dr. Shakira Suglia and
comprised of experts in epidemiology, obstetrics, and life course theory. The results from these
aims will expand our understanding of women’s trajectories of cardiometabolic health and its
relationship with cumulative stress across the life course and may expand options for novel
prevention strategies in the preconception, prenatal, and postpartum periods."

Olfactory loss is a prodromal symptom of neurodegenerative diseases and is also frequently observed in
clinical manifestations among COVID-19 patients. Whether the degree of olfactory deficit in COVID-19 is
indicative of any long-term neurological diseases has not been carefully evaluated. Recent human studies
have identified that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with the early onset of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson
disease. In this study, we created an acute neurodegenerative disease mouse model, which allows us to
investigate the impact of neurotoxic aggregates in the olfactory bulb on neuroinflammation and pathology
propagation. We hypothesize that viral infection induced inflammation compounds with predisposed
neurotoxic aggregates induced inflammation. Specifically, we will characterize inflammatory responses in
the olfactory system induced by stereotaxically injected amyloid beta and alpha-synuclein aggregates and
further establish SARS-CoV-2 infections paradigms along with the acute neurotoxin model to study
molecular and cellular phenotypes between external pathogen exposure and internal protein aggregates
induced changes. Through this study, we will gain an understanding of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection
on neurotoxic aggregate associated neurodegeneration."

 Conduct problem (CP) symptoms in early childhood, including aggression and defiance, are
associated with adverse social, emotional, and behavioral outcomes extending into adolescence and
adulthood. The presence of callous-unemotional (CU) behaviors among children with CPs
exacerbates these negative outcomes and reduces the effectiveness of evidence-based treatments.
Given the severe negative trajectories and high societal costs associated with early CP and CU, it is
important to accurately identify young children exhibiting CU behaviors to inform early intervention
efforts for children with CPs. Traditional measures of CU behaviors exhibit some inconsistencies,
necessitating a more nuanced multimodal approach. This study utilizes multiple units of analysis,
including physiological measures (i.e., heart rate variability), parent/teacher ratings, and observational
coding, to assess levels of CU among young children with and without CPs.
 Emotional development in early childhood, encompassing empathy acquisition, is shaped by
direct interactions with parents and environmental observations. Parents play a crucial role in
socializing their children's emotional experiences through supportive or non-supportive reactions,
discussions, and emotional expressiveness. Parental emotion socialization, particularly emotion talk,
is considered a crucial factor influencing child outcomes. Positive emotion socialization is linked to
favorable outcomes, including less severe symptoms of CP and lower levels of CU behaviors,
highlighting the importance of parental influence. While cross-sectional research establishes the
impact of parental emotion socialization on child empathy and CP severity, the current study aims to
investigate the longitudinal association (across the course of one year), specifically examining
whether it can buffer the negative effects of CU on later CP severity.
 The study involves secondary data analysis from a sample of children with and without CPs
(n=323), exploring multiple measures of CU behaviors across three timepoints. Aim 1 seeks to
determine if physiological functioning, observed empathy, and parent/teacher ratings of CU behaviors
converge into a single latent factor. Aim 2 will examine intra- and interindividual variability in the CU
latent factor at baseline and over time, and its predictability of CP severity on year later. Lastly, Aim 3
focuses on parental emotion socialization and its potential impact on the link between CU behaviors
and later CP severity."

Exposure to even moderate levels (<3 Gy) of ionizing radiation can result in severe
pancyotopenia, placing patients as wells as victims of accidental exposure at high risks for
infection and uncontrolled hemorrhaging. Accidental exposure differs from radiation therapy in
that biodosimetry (e.g., type of radiation, dose and dose rate) is often uncertain; consequently,
the optimal treatment regimen to ameliorate the effects of radiation is not immediately evident.
Therefore, victims of accidental ionizing radiation exposure would benefit from bridging
therapies to traverse extended periods of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia until the optimal
course of medical care can be determined.
Ossium Health proposes to develop a bank of myeloid committed progenitors (MCP) from
deceased donor bone marrow (BM). The strategy employs commercially available GMP-
compliant, closed-system flow separation device to specifically select MCP from whole BM
based on defining cell surface markers CD34+CD38+. The proposed Phase II studies build
on our previously successful Phase I, demonstrating our ability to select highly pure
MCP from whole BM from deceased organ donors. In this phase we will refine selection
and expand the pool of donor BM that can be used. The cells will be validated in vitro
and in vivo in an immunocompromised mouse hematopoietic-acute radiation syndrome
model to demonstrate enhanced survival.
The overall product of this research program will be a compelling preclinical package to justify
definitive studies to support FDA approval under the Animal Rule for a novel radiation/nuclear
mass casualty medical countermeasure bridging therapy. Commercial viability for both medical
countermeasures and civilian uses is enhanced by the up to 5-fold lower cost for manufacturing
compared to current technologies."

Calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), as one of the family C G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), largely
modulates extracellular Ca2+ by triggering multiple intracellular signaling pathways. CaSR is expressed in the
kidneys, parathyroid glands, colon, and other cells, representing its differential yet key roles in responding to
extracellular calcium, amino acids, and metabolites, in different organs. Numerous diseases have been attributed
to calcium mishandling (e.g.,nephrolithiasis) and secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT), with over 200 CaSR
mutations that can significantly alter CaSR expression. There is a pressing unmet medical need to develop
positive allosteric modulators for PKD and other diseases with cellular and organ specificity and reduced liver
toxicity. The major barriers to developing effective drugs are a lack of knowledge of tempo-spatial quantitative
expression of CaSR in the body and its changes during disease progression and regression. We recently
determined the first crystal structure of the human CaSR extracellular domain (ECD) with a bound tryptophan
derivative (TNCA) at 2.1 Å, a potential positive allosteric modulator. This led us to design and synthesize a drug
candidate TNCA that has strong agonist activity and specificity to CaSR. The goal of this Phase I proposal is to
acquire proof-of-concept results for design and generation of TNCA analogs having optimal drug activity and
cellular specificity as agonists and antagonists. In addition, we will also develop CaSR targeted PET agents for
renal imaging in a preclinical Pkhd1PCK rat model (studies in this model led to clinical trials of an FDA-approved
PKD therapeutic). Aim 1 is to optimize and determine TNCA analogs with best CaSR drug activity as agonists &
antagonists. Aim 2 is to perform in vivo mapping of CaSR distribution in PKD (Pkhd1PCK) rat model by microPET
imaging. Phase II will further validate drug efficacy of TNCA analogs, imaging capability for CaSR associated
kidney diseases using animal models, and safety profile for an eIND. Success in our proposed studies will
provide essential results for a novel avenue in the development of CaSR specific drug candidates for the effective
treatment of various CaSR associated human diseases using newly available structures and patented
methodology. In addition, the developed PET imaging agents will enable us to map CaSR distribution and
heterogeneous expression during PKD disease progression and regression in vivo, as a companion diagnostic
for patient risk stratification, and for outcome prediction and novel drug development. We anticipate that the
proposed studies will foster the development of transformative novel markers of the disease activity that will
enhance clinical care of PKD and other kidney diseases."

Keraceuticals is developing a patent-protected novel class of anticancer drugs called 1,3-thioureas for the
treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). OSCC is the most common oral malignancy, accounting for
80–90% of all oral cancers and 60% of all cases of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Among
all types of HNSCC, OSCC has the highest recurrence rates and lowest median survival. Even with additional
treatment, the survival rate for recurrent OSCC is a mere 6-7 months. Patient outcomes for OSCC have not
changed in 50 years, due in part to the fact that no targeted therapies have been developed for advanced and
recurrent OSCC. Thus, there is a significant unmet need to identify and develop novel therapies to treat OSCC.
In response to this need, Keraceuticals developed 1,3-thioureas that demonstrate potent antiproliferative effects
against a panel of cancer types including OSCC, non-small cell lung cancer, breast, prostate, brain, and
endometrial cancer in vitro. 1,3-thioureas inhibit oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and calcium homeostasis
in cancers providing a one-two punch that results in endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial membrane
depolarization, and subsequent reactive oxygen species-driven apoptosis selectively in tumor cells.
Keraceuticals’ lead compound, CIDD99 has shown promising results in OSCC cell lines, and significantly
reduced tumor volumes (5-fold) in OSCC mouse xenograft models when administered intraperitoneally.
However, additional R&D is required to develop formulations for oral and/or intravenous administration of
CIDD99 and to determine the bioavailability of subsequent PK and tissue distribution prior to initiating
manufacturing, full-scale toxicology studies, and clinical trials. This Phase I project proposes the following Aims:
1. Formulate CIDD99 for oral and/or IV administration. Rapid assessment of these oral and/or IV formulations
will be performed on blood from non-tumor-bearing mice and enable fast identification of appropriate formulations
for larger efficacy studies, comprehensive PK studies, and tissue distribution analyses. Formulations with equal
or improved blood concentrations will be utilized in Aim 2. 2. Confirm formulated CIDD99 efficacy and compare
against standards of care in mouse OSCC models. The most efficacious formulation will be evaluated as a lone
treatment or in combination with cisplatin or the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors cetuximab
and gefitinib. Lastly, tongue tumor models will be used to assess metastatic disease. Effects on tumor growth,
nodal disease, tolerability, tissue distribution, and histopathology will be assessed, and initial toxicity analyses
will be performed. These key studies will verify efficacy of formulations that enable oral and/or IV administration
for future clinical trials. Mechanistic effects on in vivo EGFR signaling, apoptosis, and markers of epithelial
mesenchymal transition will also be evaluated. The above studies and proposed milestones will serve as Go/No
Go criteria for a future Phase II application that will confirm efficacy in additional mouse models and initiate GMP
manufacturing as well as IND-enabling toxicology studies in preparation for IND submission."
10978184,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In the most severe cases of epilepsy, where seizures persist despite multiple trials of anti-seizure medications,
patients may benefit from surgical removal of seizure-generating brain tissue. Prior to surgery, electrodes are
often implanted directly into or onto the patient’s brain and are used to continuously record electrical brain
activity over days. This is done to capture seizure activity and determine its point of origin, i.e. the seizure
onset zone. If the seizure onset zone is identified, clinicians then use this information, in combination with the
results of brain imaging and other testing, to guide removal of the corresponding brain tissue. While epilepsy
surgery may lead to seizure freedom, 70-90% of surgery patients remain on anti-seizure medications and
roughly 50% of patients continue to have seizures. The long-term goal of this work is to improve the outcomes
of patients undergoing epilepsy surgery by developing more accurate methods to localize seizure-generating
tissue. High frequency oscillations (HFOs) have garnered considerable excitement for their potential to identify
and localize epileptogenic brain tissue. HFOs are short bursts of high-frequency electrical activity that occur in
the brains of patients with epilepsy. They occur more frequently in the epileptogenic zone (EZ, the hypothetical
area that must be excised to attain post-operative seizure freedom), and surgically removing HFO-generating
brain tissue increases the likelihood of seizure freedom. While ongoing clinical trials are attempting to assess
their prospective value for epilepsy surgery planning, there are multiple barriers to their widespread use. While
group-level results are robust, HFO analysis is not yet predictive for single subjects. Recordings lack the
sensitivity to reliably measure HFOs in every patient, and the occurrence of non-epileptic HFOs confounds the
results. Therefore, HFOs are poised to revolutionize epilepsy surgery, but there is a critical need to optimize
their measurement and maximize single-subject accuracy. The overall objective of this proposal is to improve
EZ localization accuracy through systematic determination of the optimal HFO measurement methodology,
coupled with novel, robust methods for HFO analysis. The rationale is that developing these novel methods
with improved measurement techniques will increase the accuracy and robustness of HFOs as a biomarker of
the seizure onset zone, thus improving the surgical management of epilepsy. To attain our objective, we will
pursue three specific aims: (1) Demonstrate that electrode size is a crucial factor in HFO measurement. (2)
Develop an automated method for patient-specific localization of the EZ based on HFOs. (3) Evaluate the
effects of electrode size and HFO analysis method on EZ localization. The proposed research is significant
because it will provide specific recommendations for the measurement and analysis of HFOs, enabling
accurate, detailed localization of epileptogenic brain tissue. The expected outcome of this work is that it will
guide surgeons in choosing which brain regions to remove and will increase the pool of potential surgical
candidates. Overall, this will have a positive impact by leading to a greater chance of seizure freedom and
improved quality of life for patients with the most severe cases of epilepsy."

Arterial calcification results from the deposition of calcium hydroxyapatite crystals in the vessel wall. It is highly
prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes as well as those with peripheral artery
disease (PAD). When located in the arterial media, calcification is strongly associated with increased
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Calcification is a highly regulated process controlled by a series of
endogenous stimulators and inhibitors. Elevated phosphate levels can induce osteogenic transformation of
vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). These cells release extracellular matrix-degrading enzymes including
the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that contribute to calcification. Despite significant progress, arterial
calcification continues to be poorly understood and no useable drugs to prevent or treat it have been developed.
For this reason, the process of identifying novel molecular targets, and developing therapies to target them are
critical for improving outcomes in our vascular patients. The second messenger cyclic nucleotides cAMP and
cGMP play important regulatory roles in a variety of human diseases that are controlled by distinct cyclic
nucleotide PDE isozymes that have proven to be ideal and feasible drug targets for the treatment of human
diseases. The function and regulation of PDEs in arterial calcification, however, remains unknown. This
proposal is based on our preliminary data showing that phosphodiesterase 1 0A (PDE10A) is the most highly
induced isoform among all PDE genes in a rodent calcification model. PDE10A is also markedly increased in
calcifying VSMCs in vitro, calcified arteries in vivo, and calcified human tibial arteries from patients with PAD.
Knockdown and inhibition of PDE10A significantly attenuate phosphate-induced VSMC osteogenic
transformation and calcification in vitro, and deficiency of PDE10A reduces arterial calcification in vivo. Using
bioinformatics analyses and a loss-of-function strategy, we have shown that the MMP family member 3 (MMP-
3, stromelysin-1) can be regulated by PDE10A in VSMCs cultured in a calcification medium. Our further
preliminary mechanistic results have shown that both knockdown and inhibition of PDE1 0A block p38 MAPK
activation in VSMCs during calcification. We have additionally found that inhibition of p38 MAPK attenuates
MMP-3 upregulation under calcifying conditions. In this project, we propose that PDE10A mediates arterial
calcification by regulating p38 MAPK-MMP-3 signaling. In this series of experiments, we will establish the role
of PDE10A in arterial calcification and provide insights into the potential use of PDE10A inhibition strategies to
reduce calcification in patients with CKD and PAD. Our aims are to 1) investigate the actions of PDE10A in
vascular SMC osteogenic transformation and arterial calcification, 2) examine the therapeutic potential of
PDE10A inhibition in arterial calcification, and 3) assess the significance of p38-MAPK-MMP-3 signaling in
PDE10A-mediated vascular calcification."

The three-dimensional (3D) chromatin architecture in mammals represents a remarkable yet not fully understood
biological process. The high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) technique, known as Hi-C, is
instrumental in identifying diverse chromatin structures. Despite this, the ways in which the 3D chromatin
architectures in T cells are influenced by the tumor immune microenvironment, and how this impacts cancer
outcomes, remain largely unexplored. Renal medullary carcinoma (RMC) stands out as a particularly aggressive
cancer that predominantly affects young individuals of African descent, especially those with sickle cell disease
(SCD). Treatment options for RMC are currently limited. The most promising among them are immune
checkpoint blockades (ICIs). However, to truly harness the potential of ICI-based therapies, there's an urgent
need for a deeper understanding of the RMC immune microenvironment and the underlying mechanisms of
RMC. The 3D chromatin architecture in cells related to RMC remains a relatively uncharted territory.
 Guided by the expertise of cancer biologist Dr. Liuqing Yang, epigeneticist Dr. Wenbo Li, and Dr. Pavlos
Msaouel, a clinician specializing in rare renal carcinomas, our team has harnessed the power of Hi-C. We aimed
to delineate the distinct chromatin structures in CD8+ T cells from SCD patients in contrast to those from healthy
individuals and to understand the ramifications of these changes on the development and prognosis of RMC.
Intriguingly, our preliminary findings highlight significant modifications in the 3D genomic structure of CD8+ T
cells derived from SCD donors. A notable observation is the diminished chromatin loop stemming from the
SLC7A11 locus in the SCD condition. This locus plays a pivotal role in ferroptosis, a specialized form of
programmed cell death involving iron. Building on these insights, we postulate that ferroptosis in SCD-induced
CD8+ T cells contributes to the immune resistance observed in RMC, with altered chromatin structures being
central to this process. Our project is anchored in three specific objectives: 1) Establish the connection between
altered chromatin architecture and the molecular pathway linking SCD and RMC tumorigenesis; 2) Delve into
the 3D genomic mechanisms driving ferroptosis in CD8+ T cells in SCD; 3) Assess the significance of both
ferroptosis and the altered genomic architecture in CD8+ T cells on the overall disease landscape.
 Our team envisions that within a decade, ICI and CAR T-cell therapy will emerge as frontline treatments
for RMC, enhancing cure rates and addressing the current limitations of standard care. By delving into the role
of altered 3D chromatin structures in RMC's molecular mechanisms, we hope to equip the scientific community
with insights crucial for devising strategies that safely and effectively sensitize RMC to ICI and CAR T-cell
therapies. The data generated from our investigations will lay the groundwork for early-phase clinical studies led
by Dr. Pavlos Msaouel. These studies will be pivotal in addressing questions about the next generation of ICI
and T-cell therapies tailored for RMC."
10976779,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Approximately 20% of older adults in the United States have a voice disorder. One of the most common voice
disorders in older adults is presbyphonia, related to changes in the larynx and respiratory system that occur with
aging. Persons with presbyphonia have softer, weaker, rougher voices. As a result, they have a harder time
communicating and participating in social activities. This can lead to adverse effects on social interaction, overall
well-being, and cascade into loneliness, depression, and worse quality of life.
 While patients commonly report these challenges, the relationship between voice impairment and social
interaction has not been adequately studied in older adults. We seek to further understand the impact of
presbyphonia on social function and well-being. We hypothesize that older adults with presbyphonia will exhibit
elevated social isolation and disconnectedness scores as compared to age-matched control participants without
voice disorders. Furthermore, we hypothesize that social isolation and social disconnectedness scores will
improve after participation in a voice therapy program specifically designed for older adults with presbyphonia,
phonation resistance training exercises (PhoRTE). We will use validated social interaction and voice
questionnaires, functional voice assessments, and structured interviews to gain a comprehensive understanding
of how presbyphonia affects older adults and what effects participation in voice therapy may have on voice
function and social interaction.
 Our proposed research is innovative as it provides a comprehensive characterization of voice from both
functional and social perspectives. Our project is unique because we plan to employ a combination of validated
patient-reported outcome measures, innovative voice acoustic analysis, aerodynamic parameters, perceptual
voice analysis, and structured interviews with innovative recall technique (Photovoice) to better understand the
impact of presbyphonia on social interaction and mood. There are very few studies have utilized Photovoice,
which is a qualitative assessment tool where participants take photographs using a camera to document needs
and concerns from their own viewpoints. This will enable us to understand our participants’ environments that
they may not share during interview. An investigative team with expertise in speech pathology, laryngology,
gerontology, qualitative interviewing, acoustic and aerodynamic analysis, and patient-reported outcomes has
been assembled to strengthen the quality of the proposed research.
 This study is significant because it will improve our understanding of how voice disorders affect older adults
from a comprehensive perspective. Given the importance of voice in social interaction, and the risks to general
health that can occur with social isolation, characterizing this impact is clinically and scientifically valuable. Our
work will be able to help a large population of older adults struggling with voice disorders."

The oral mucosa is constantly exposed to a bacteria-rich environment coupled with continual physical trauma.
For patients, chronic oral wounds aren't merely an inconvenience. They can impair nutrition intake and pose a
substantial risk of debilitating infections, marking a significant oral health challenge. Defining factors involved in
oral wound healing would allow the identification of novel therapeutic targets to improve tissue repair. Oral wound
healing has long been considered a model of optimal wound resolution characterized by rapid and scarless
wound healing. However, the intrinsic genetic and epigenetic controlling mechanisms that make oral mucosa
highly adaptable to accelerated healing upon injury remain unclear. An important aspect of healing is re-
epithelialization, which entails both proliferation and migration of keratinocytes at the periphery of the wound.
Understanding the role and function of keratinocytes in re-epithelialization will benefit patients with chronic
wounds.
We recently identified a previously unnoticed landscape of non-coding RNA in saliva and found piwi-interacting
RNA (piRNA) is surprisingly abundant in saliva. Of particular interest are three distinctive oral-piRNAs that are
uniquely present in saliva and oral keratinocytes and appear to contribute to the oral wound re-epithelialization
phenotype. The preliminary data involving inhibition of oral piRNAs concomitant with a failure of wounds to heal
in a timely fashion suggests that these small RNAs may play a significant role in mediating wound healing. The
overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that oral-piRNAs are intrinsic factors in human oral keratinocytes, that
modulate the rate of wound closure. Two specific aims are in place to further characterize the wound healing
phenotype and elucidate the cellular factors responsible for oral-piRNA-mediated phenotypes. Aim 1 is to
investigate the role of saliva piRNAs on oral wound re-epithelialization using 3D ex vivo and in vivo oral wound
healing models. Aim 2 is to elucidate the mechanism by which piRNAs regulate oral wound healing. This proposal
aims to unravel how these novel oral-piRNAs accelerate human oral keratinocyte proliferation and migration,
which may improve wound healing therapeutic developments. The long-term goals of this proposed study are to
enhance our understanding of the biological roles of piRNA relevant to human oral health and diseases and
leverage these findings to improve wound healing outcomes for patients."

 The notion that disabled people would seek pregnancy and motherhood defies long-held social norms
and is fraught with echoes of the eugenics movement of early 20th century America. Nevertheless, pregnancy
and parenthood are increasingly common among disabled people. Despite the increasing numbers of disabled
women having babies, obstetricians often have little training in how best to provide high quality care to this
diverse population, documented through perspectives of both obstetric clinicians themselves and women with
disabilities. Disabled women often experience worse maternal and child health outcomes than their
nondisabled peers. Barriers to optimal care include lack of training and disability knowledge of obstetric
clinicians; lack of professional guidelines for providers; provider unwillingness to care for women with
disabilities; inaccessible equipment and facilities, poor communication, and ableist attitudes and practices
among obstetric health care providers and staff. Furthermore, emerging research suggests that ableist and
discriminatory experiences in reproductive care may disproportionately affect disabled women of color.
Research, both with disabled women and obstetricians, has identified recommendations for improving care,
however, the critical next step have yet to be taken – designing an educational intervention to address these
concerns and prepare obstetricians to provide inclusive care.
 This study will develop an online continuing education program for practicing obstetricians that
addresses ableism and structural ableism in perinatal and postpartum care. The study will first conduct focus
groups and key informant interviews to identify essential content and optimal approaches for educating
providers about mitigating ableist attitudes, practices, and policies, structural access barriers, and providing
perinatal care to a diverse population of disabled patients. Based on these findings, the study team will design
an online continuing medical education program and conduct a randomized controlled trial with 200 obstetric
providers. Participants will complete assessments prior to training, and at three- and 9-months following
completion. The study will measure change in ableist attitudes and clinical policies and practices. Knowledge
acquisition, satisfaction with course content, and usability will similarly be evaluated. We will also interview 20
participants about their experiences and revise the program accordingly. We will collaborate with the American
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) to disseminate the final program to practicing
obstetricians. This project directly addresses priorities identified by the funding agency to develop and test
interventions at a community or health systems level to mitigate adverse health effects of ableism and
structural ableism. The expected outcome of this project is an innovative educational intervention to improve
provider knowledge to mitigate ableism in perinatal care."

developing zebrafish urinary system.
This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as NOT-CA-
21-100. Manufacturing practices and chemical disposal have leached thousands of chemicals into our
environment. Many of these chemicals, like bisphenol A (BPA), have concerning implications into multitudes of
developmental anomaly and cancer incidences. Studying development expands our understanding of the cancer
phenotype of mature tissues. Zebrafish are a well-established model in toxicogenomics - the study of interactions
of chemicals and gene expression. They have recently been found to have a bladder which expands their
potential for understanding bladder oncogenesis. We have designed a python-automated image analysis
platform that sets the stage for a system that increases detection and analysis of chemical-induced phenotypes.
The goal of this study is to determine the transcriptomic changes associated with developmental exposure to the
BPA in an effort to better understand the oncogenic mechanisms associated with those exposures. Dr. Morhardt
will carry out cloning experiments on a set of chemical-induced genes using CRISPR, inject those cloned genes
into zebrafish larvae, and assess the changes associated with over- and under-expression of those genes.
Zebrafish will also be exposed to BPA and examined for transcriptomic changes. Candidate genes from BPA
exposure experiments will over- and underexpressed using CRISPR in a similar fashion to the initial CRISPR
studies in aim 1. Genomic alternations will be compared with transcriptomic changes in TCGA database. These
experiments will identify the transcriptomic mechanisms of chemically-induced developmental anomalies and
create insights into chemically-induced oncogenesis"

Limited data are available on the effects of antenatal opioid exposure on the brain and
neurodevelopment. Most studies are limited by methodologic flaws in study design, including small sample sizes
and difficulty controlling for important environmental variables. The OBOE (Outcomes of Babies with Opioid
Exposure) study, an ongoing NICHD-funded longitudinal study enrolling infants with and without antenatal opioid
exposure at birth and following them to 2 years of age, attempts to improve on the limitations of previous research
by collecting comprehensive exposure data including infant umbilical cords, advanced neuroimaging data to
evaluate brain development, and standardized and thorough information on the home environment, maternal
mental health, and parenting. The OBOE consortium, comprised of 4 high performing centers, a data
coordinating center, and a neuroimaging core, has completed our goal enrollment of 200 opioid-exposed and
100 unexposed infants. In response to RFA-HD-24-014, we now propose to complete follow-up to age two in
our OBOE cohort, to fulfill our main study objectives. The Case site has contributed to the OBOE study by
enrolling 29 infants (24 opioid-exposed and 5 controls), completing 25 MRIs thus far, and contributing
to the publication of multiple abstracts and three manuscripts using OBOE data. For this renewal grant,
we will continue progress toward our aims to : 1) determine the impact of antenatal opioid exposure on brain
structure and connectivity over the first two years of life; 2) define medical, developmental and behavioral
trajectories over the first two years of life in exposed infants; and 3) determine how the home environment,
maternal mental health, and parenting modify trajectories of brain connectivity and neurodevelopment over the
first two years of life. Our progress so far, with enrollment completed and success in following this difficult
population, shows that we have the ability to successfully complete the objectives of the OBOE study.

11003454,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The gut microbiome makes significant contributions to whole-body glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity, in
part, through production of short chain fatty acids (SCFA)1–3. Recent evidence suggests that microbial SCFA
production may be increased by exercise training, and that SCFA may be important positive regulators of
exercise performance and skeletal muscle metabolism and function4. However, it is not known how gut microbes
could regulate SCFA production in response to exercise. Our work identifies lactate utilizing bacteria (LU-Bac),
which can convert lactate to SCFA, as potential sources of SCFA during exercise5. As circulating lactate levels
increase during moderate to high intensity exercise, combining LU-Bac supplementation with exercise may result
in higher levels of circulating SCFA, thus enhancing the metabolic benefits of exercise. Individuals with impaired
glucose tolerance have lower gut LU-Bac content, and blunted metabolic and aerobic improvements in response
to exercise training4. Thus, in addition to improving metabolic health, LU-Bac supplementation may enhance the
health benefits of exercise by ameliorating the metabolic defects that lead to impaired training response. We
hypothesize that lactate produced by muscle with regular exercise is used by LU-Bac to generate SCFA, which
then act on skeletal muscle to improve metabolism and function. We propose this novel gut-muscle axis leads
to improved metabolic health and exercise response. One aim of this proposal is to test LU-Bac supplementation
as a treatment for impaired glucose tolerance and low response to exercise in mouse models of metabolic
disease that partially reflect the pathologies of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. A second aim is to determine the
specific contribution of lactate fermentation by LU-Bac to circulating and tissue SCFA levels with exercise, and
whether LU-Bac-derived SCFA contribute to the health benefits of exercise training. Our third aim is to define
the mechanisms in skeletal muscle by which SCFA lead to enhanced exercise performance and metabolic
health. Specifically, we will determine whether SCFA receptors and transporters in muscle are necessary for
the positive effects of SCFA on muscle metabolism and function. This work will have a broad impact on the
fields of exercise, metabolism, and microbiology by determining the mechanisms by which the microbiome can
enhance muscle metabolism and adaptation to exercise. We anticipate our results will lead to development of a
live biotherapeutic to improve exercise response and metabolic health."
11004192,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nutrient sensing pathways (mTOR, AMPK, sirtuins) are core components underlying the aging process, linking
post-translation modifications critical to cellular function to environmental factors. To date, research in this area
has largely focused on interventions such as caloric or protein restriction that drive lifespan or slow aging-related
morbidities. An emerging area of research derived from these intervention studies highlights the potential of fat
catabolism, the lipolytic degradation of triacylglycerol stored within lipid droplets (LDs), as a major factor during
the aging process. Despite accumulating evidence for a beneficial role of lipolysis, the mechanism that links
lipolysis to healthspan is poorly understood. Dr. Charles Najt recently identified the LD protein perilipin 5 (PLIN5)
to be the critical link between lipolysis and the nutrient sensor SIRT1; loss of PLIN5 ablated adipose-triglyceride
lipase (ATGL)-mediated activation of SIRT1. Our published and preliminary data show that in response to
cAMP/PKA signaling, which is driven by fasting or caloric restriction (CR), PLIN5 binds and transports
monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs) produced from lipolysis to the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, MUFAs liberated
from PLIN5 allosterically activate SIRT1. These results provide an underlying mechanism explaining the growing
body of literature that has linked MUFAs to improved healthspan. Yet, while CR or intermittent fasting,
interventions shown to increase healthspan, increase PLIN5 expression, little is known about the direct role of
PLIN5 in healthspan or longevity. A few studies indicate Plin5 expression peaks around middle age, slowly
decreasing over time or drastically decreases in oxidative tissues during metabolic disease, yet the cause of
these changes or the impact of decreased Plin5 expression is unknown. This is a significant gap in knowledge
as PLIN5 has been shown to mitigate metabolic disease but its ability to influence health or lifespan has yet to
be established. In the current proposal we aim to fill this gap in knowledge, providing significant results directly
linking PLIN5 lipid signaling and metabolic flexibility to healthy aging. We hypothesize that PLIN5 signaling in
the nucleus is critical for maintaining metabolic health during aging, whereas breakdown of this signaling axis
results in age-related morbidities, decreasing healthspan. Moreover, we propose that maintaining PLIN5
signaling throughout life, will increase healthspan and enhance dietary interventions. This hypothesis is
significant as no study to date has determined the role of PLIN5 during aging or what role it has in healthspan
promoting interventions such as the Mediterranean Diet, which is considered the ideal diet for healthy aging. By
focusing on a novel niche in lipid signaling and directly relating PLIN5 to health and lifespan, we are establishing
strong fundamental biology that is extremely relevant to healthy aging. The proposed studies are well-aligned
with the funding areas listed as of special interest in aging, allowing the applicant to progress to independent
investigator status in a new and growing field."
10985212,"Project Summary
 Poststroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) was found to be common in various research studies. PSCI is
ideally recognized through cognitive screening and test but they are not standard clinical practices and hence
stroke recovery and prevention of recurrent strokes may be undermined by concurrent but poorly recognized
cognitive issues, e.g., patient compliance to follow blood pressure control medication may be poorer among
those with PSCI. Therefore, a significant unmet need for optimizing poststroke care is to recognize patients at
high risk of PSCI to tailor for them an appropriate stroke recovery and recurrent stroke prevention strategy.
With many of the plausible determinants of PSCI being available in electronic health record (EHR) systems,
machine learning (ML) methods to process routine clinical data to predict risk of PSCI is highly feasible. We
propose to combine a large retrospective dataset from EHR and a smaller prospective dataset with more
accurate ascertainment of PSCI based on purposefully administered cognitive tests, serving as gold-standard.
The necessity of prospective cognitive tests to accurately ascertain PSCI further allows us to explore biological
and physiological variables related to pathologies of Alzheimer disease and related dementia (ADRD). We will
pursue three specific aims: 1) Learn to predict PSCI using routine neuro images and EHR data from large
clinical cohorts; 2) Use prospective data to adapt and validate models learned from existing clinical cohorts; 3)
Phenotype PSCI with cognitive tests, physiological, and biological metrics one-year poststroke. Prediction of
PSCI could aid optimizing stroke recovery and recurrent stroke prevention strategies. Our proposed novel
physiological and biological metrics have the potential to further improve PSCI prediction and characterize
PSCI granularly with the consideration of cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative underpinnings."

The fundamental view of bacterial cells is that they are not organized because they generally
lack membrane-bound organelles. Despite the textbook perception that bacteria are
disorganized, a growing array of non-membrane-bound organelles called “biomolecular
condensates” have been identified. These condensates are formed through the physical
process of liquid-liquid phase separation and have the capacity to selectively organize enzymes
and substrates into distinct subcellular locations, suggesting bacterial cells may be highly
organized. The Schrader lab identified the first bacterial condensate in the bacterium C.
crescentus, termed the BR-body, which was found to organize the bacterial RNA decay
machinery, facilitating its complex multi-step biochemical pathway. Bioinformatic signatures of
BR-bodies have been identified across bacteria including many pathogens, suggesting they are
broadly conserved. In addition, several bacterial biomolecular condensates have subsequently
been identified that are involved in diverse biochemical pathways, suggesting that bacterial cells
are generally organized by non-membrane-bound organelles, yet the number and diversity of
such structures remains poorly characterized. By combining in vivo imaging experiments and in
vitro biochemistry we seek to define the important aspects of biomolecular condensate function
and diversity in bacteria. We believe that many of the characteristics of C. crescentus BR-
bodies will be shared in pathogenic organisms, potentially leading to the identification of new
antibiotic targets."

Perceived loneliness is an independent risk factor for both diabetes and dementia. Older adult populations are
a high-risk group for the metabolic and cognitive consequences of social isolation due to frailty, loss of mobility
and lack of affordable transportation. However, the neural mechanism underlying the relationship between social
connection, glucose homeostasis, and cognitive health is poorly understood. To address this gap, my F99/K00
proposal builds on preclinical and clinical evidence demonstrating that social isolation negatively impacts glucose
homeostasis. Glucose regulation is critical in the progression of both diabetes and dementia. Oxytocin is a
neurohormone which modulates social behavior and energy balance. The oxytocin receptor (OTR) is highly
expressed in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), a brain area critical to glucose homeostasis. VMH glucose
sensing neurons respond to fluctuations in extracellular glucose to regulate peripheral glucose homeostasis.
However, the role of oxytocin in modulating VMH glucose sensing and the extent to which social isolation disrupts
VMH glucose sensing has never been investigated. Our preliminary data demonstrate that:1) single-housed mice
are hyperglycemic compared to co-housed mice; 2) VMH OTR neurons are inhibited by glucose; 3) VMH OTR
neurons co-express neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), a marker for glucose-inhibited (GI) neurons.
Together, this evidence supports our central hypothesis that oxytocin modulates VMH glucose sensing
neurons, and that social isolation amplifies this modulation leading to a hyperglycemic phenotype.
AIM 1 F99 Phase: I will investigate the mechanism by which social isolation induces hyperglycemia. I will
perform whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology in brain slices to determine whether oxytocin modulates GI
neurons. I will use in vivo fiber photometry calcium recordings to determine if VMH-OTR activity increases during
induced hypoglycemia. I will use CRISPR/Cas9 to selectively knock down the VMH OTR receptor in co-housed
mice and determine glycemic differences compared to controls. These F99 experiments will contribute
mechanistic insights regarding the role of oxytocin in social isolation-induced glucose dysregulation. My training
plan will provide the conceptual and technical neuroscience foundation necessary for the K00 phase of my career
development plan.
AIM 2 K00 Phase: I will determine if social contexts affect cognitive aging via oxytocin control of
glycemia AIM 2A will use an aging rodent model to determine how different patterns of endogenous oxytocin
release affect glucose homeostasis and memory performance. These experiments will allow me to build on my
F99 skillset and gain expertise in optogenetics, social behaviors, and cognitive testing assays. AIM 2B will use
secondary analysis methods to model human longitudinal data and identify the specific social relationships that
mediate the link between loneliness, diabetes, and cognitive function in diverse patient sub-populations"

developing OBOE protocols and budgets; (2) support OBOE protocol design, training, and implementation;
(3) provide data management for the consortium, including programming data management systems and
preparing reports for the SSMB, SC, OBOE subcommittees, clinical centers, and NICHD/NIH; (4) provide the
neuroimaging expertise for the consortium to help ensure standardization of neuroimaging data acquisition,
monitor image acquisition, promote sharing among sites, review and assess images, and provide subject
matter expertise for study result analyses; (5) conduct statistical analyses of study data for interim

results of OBOE studies in a timely and accurate manner; (6) manage capitation funds, disbursing payments
to clinical centers based on enrolled patients and other study milestone triggers, specified in the study
protocols and budgets; and (7) provide the logistical support necessary to run an effective and productive
consortium. The DCC and four OBOE Clinical Centers have a long history of successful collaboration on
completed and ongoing neonatal follow-up studies, including MRI studies and those focused on neonatal
opioid withdrawal syndrome. RTI’s approach as the DCC has many innovations such as (1) using an RTI-
developed avatar-based Consenter video app to assist with the informed consent process; (2) combining
RTI’s extensive data science and statistical expertise with the cutting-edge neuroimaging innovations of
Children’s National Medical Center, we will complete one of the first studies on brain structure and
connectivity in opioid-exposed infants; (3) integrating analysis of both MRI findings and comprehensive
neurodevelopmental assessments; (4) analyzing serial MRI assessments to examine longitudinal trajectories
through age 2, and (5) advancing emerging research on social determinants of health and their role in child
development."
11001691,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Focal epilepsy is the most common form of refractory epilepsy. Focal seizures are often associated with
malformations of cortical development (MCD) but can also occur in the absence of a radiographically-detected
lesion. Patients will often require surgical resection of the epileptogenic lesion to control their seizures, as many
patients develop a drug resistance to the numerous antiepileptic drugs available. The availability of resected
tissue has allowed for the study of the role of somatic variation in focal epilepsy. Somatic variation arising during
embryonic brain development is increasingly recognized as a major contributor to genetic risk of focal epilepsy.
Somatic variants localized to the brain have been readily identified in hemimegalencephaly and focal cortical
dysplasia (FCD) type II; furthermore, evidence suggests that somatic variants also contribute to FCD type I and
radiographically nonlesional focal epilepsy. While there has been substantial progress in our understanding of
the genetic architecture underlying focal epilepsy, more work is needed to characterize the remaining cases
lacking a genetic cause. Continued work to identify novel genes and the types of variants involved in focal
epilepsy is essential to further advance understanding of the underlying mechanisms of disease and fuel the
development of novel therapeutic approaches. The overall goal of my dissertation and postdoctoral research is
to advance novel gene discovery in focal epilepsy and identify pathways that cause focal seizures to better inform
drug discovery strategies and widen the scope of treatment. I have demonstrated my ability to identify putative
pathogenic somatic variation affecting known epilepsy genes, as shown in my preliminary data in Aim 1. I have
also identified a disease-causing variant in genes not yet associated with focal epilepsy. In Aim 1, I propose
using deep exome and targeted sequencing approaches to identify novel genes and variants contributing to
intractable focal epilepsy. Additionally, I propose using duplex sequencing to detect low abundance somatic
variants that may have been missed by exome and panel sequencing. In the K00 Phase, I plan to expand these
studies to in vivo models to probe the functional consequence of pathogenic somatic variation in the zebrafish
model system. The proposed research provides opportunities for developing technical expertise in gene
discovery, functional characterization of disease-causing somatic variation and drug discovery. I will rely heavily
on the support of my sponsors to contribute to the development of my skillset in experimental design, scientific
communication, and grantsmanship; as well as advancing my search for a postdoctoral training environment that
is aligned with my research interests and career goals. The training plan outlined in this proposal integrates
scientific and professional development that will put me on a trajectory to emerge as a well-rounded and
independent investigator."

 STEAM is an educational model that presents science, technology, engineering,
arts, and math through interdisciplinary instruction. Research shows that STEAM
programs can produce STEM learning outcomes and engage a higher percentage and
broader diversity of students than traditional STEM instruction. However, three barriers
limit the implementation of STEAM in elementary schools: 1) access to resources, 2)
teacher expertise and bandwidth, and 3) class management and assessment.
 In response to these barriers, Edify Technologies proposes to develop MusiQuest
STEAM: interactive digital media for K-5 STEM education integrating audio and
music. MusiQuest STEAM comprises six hands-on technical components – Animals,
Audio Engineering, Genetics, Industrial Design, The Brain, and Waves – that will be
integrated into 60 total lessons which address Next Generation Science Standards, ten
each for grades K-5. By incorporating audio (music, sound, hearing, etc.) in every
lesson, MusiQuest STEAM will present artistic connections to STEM that help build
students' knowledge of key concepts, and inspire their interest in learning more about
biomedical science and related research.
 MusiQuest STEAM will be produced by Edify through an iterative development
process in partnership with researchers at WestEd. First, plans for MusiQuest STEAM
will be reviewed by subject matters experts. Next, two usability studies with students
and teachers will help ensure that the product's technical components and lessons are
well developed. A classroom feasibility study will measure MusiQuest STEAM's outputs
and outcomes in the classroom in order to determine if teachers can implement the
program with fidelity. Finally, WestEd will conduct summative research on a full
implementation of 10 Grade 3 and 4 lessons in 30 schools with 750 students. Teachers
and classes will be randomly assigned to either the treatment or control condition.
 The intended outcomes of this SBIR project are that: 1) students' knowledge of
grade-appropriate STEM concepts grows as measured through formal assessments; 2)
students display an understanding that audio and music can impact human and animal
health; and, 3) students demonstrate increased interest in studying STEM, and pursuing
potential careers in STEAM vocations in the future– leading to greater long-term
participation in public health professions, especially from underrepresented groups."
11007506,"Abstract
Most drugs are administered systemically and spread throughout the body. Due to lack of specificity for the
pathological site, high doses are required to achieve effective therapeutic concentrations, causing toxicity and
adverse drug effects (ADEs) at sites of the body where they are not needed. Each year, there are approximately
1.2 million reports of ADEs in the U.S. alone, representing over 5% of all hospitalized patients. ADEs also
contribute to the 90% failure rate of drug candidates due to the inability to achieve therapeutic concentrations at
the target site or intolerable side effects, thus leading to high drug development costs and prices. Toxicity and
ADEs are extremely common in chemotherapeutic compounds administered systemically, such as exatecan, a
potent inhibitor of topoisomerase I. While these compounds exhibit potent anti-tumor activity, their use and
efficacy are hindered by severe and dose-limiting toxicities, including neutropenia and liver dysfunction.
However, even specific targeting by addition of antibody conjugation to these drugs (antibody-drug conjugates;
ADCs), such as Trastuzumab-deruxtecan (an exatecan analogue) have multiple limitations including systemic
release of the chemotherapy payload, poor penetration into solid tumors and limited internalization into tumor
cells. Additional factors such as low receptor copy numbers, required internalization for payload activation, and
inefficient subcellular trafficking to the lysosome all further limit the potential development of new ADCs. Shasqi
is developing a platform to activate drugs at a specific site in the body, thus enhancing their efficacy
while minimizing systemic toxicity and adverse drug events (ADEs). Shasqi’s modular click activated
prodrug (CAP) platform addresses a critical need and broad commercial opportunity for new technologies
capable of efficient activation of therapeutics with spatiotemporal control, making drugs more efficacious by
increasing target site concentrations while also improving safety by reducing systemic exposure. This platform
also has the potential to enable the reinvestigation and repurposing of drug candidates that may have previously
been shelved due to high levels of toxicity. To achieve the aims of this Direct to Phase II study, Shasqi will first
characterize and test a novel HER2-targeted activating agent conjugates with attenuated exatecan and
deruxtecan prodrugs in a HER2+ xenograft mouse model of gastric cancer. Then, the efficacy of the platform will
be confirmed and challenged within a low expressing HER2+ cancer model and orthotopic model and
pharmacokinetics will be evaluated in naïve rats. Finally, non-GLP toxicology studies of the selected exatecan
and deruxtecan conjugates in naïve rats will be performed prior to the final step of GLP manufacturing for the
final conjugate and protodrug in advance of IND-enabling toxicology studies. The above will identify novel
antigen-targeted structures for use in Shasqi’s Gen2 CAP and will advance an initial product toward the clinic,
which could also be used in future to develop site-directed treatments for other indications, including antibiotics
for site-specific infections, autoimmunity, and localized anti-inflammatory and pain management."
11007080,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Brain cancers are the leading cause of disease-related death in children and in adults under the age of 40
years old. Even with aggressive treatments that include maximal surgical resection, stereotactic radiosurgery,
whole-brain radiation therapy, chemotherapy, molecularly targeted therapeutics, and immunotherapies, the
recurrence rates for many brain cancers are nearly 100%. Despite the hundreds of clinical trials and combination
therapies tested, the mortality rates have only slightly decreased. According to the American Cancer Society, it
is estimated that there will be over 24,000 adults and children with primary brain cancer in the US in 2023 with
no available medications that can reverse drug resistant brain cancer recurrences. When secondary brain
metastases from other primary cancers like breast, melanoma and lung are included, it is estimated that there
will be over 300,000 patients with secondary brain metastases this year in the US. These patients are confronted
with a mixed blessing of longer initial treatment survival but an increased incidence of secondary, drug resistant
brain tumors. Much like primary brain cancer, when other cancers metastasize to the brain, they are almost
always lethal. New therapies that can target adult and pediatric drug resistant recurrent primary and secondary
brain cancers are badly needed.
 Creative BioTherapeutics, has discovered that recurrent drug resistant cancers up-regulate a survival
pathway resulting in the expression and secretion of an extracellular Glucose-Regulated Protein 78 (ecGRP78)
in the tumor microenvironment. Our research shows that ecGRP78 is important for drug and immune resistance
as well as glioma stem cell formation. Cell surface bound ecGRP78 has been found on breast, lung, ovarian,
prostate, melanoma, multiple myeloma, colon, pediatric and adult brain tumors and not on normal cells. We have
found that ecGRP78 stabilizes essential oncofetal proteins, ROR1 and Cripto, along with the checkpoint protein,
PD-L1, on tumor and immune cell surfaces inducing a cascade of events to increase drug resistance, immune
suppression, and cancer stem cell formation. As such, we designed and developed several anti-cancer therapies
to specifically block the N-terminal domain of ecGRP78 from binding to and stabilizing these pro-tumorigenic
proteins on the tumor surface without disrupting normal cell function. We can now show that our lead inhibitor,
CBT300, in vitro can a) induce apoptosis of drug resistant tumor cells, b) eliminate drug and immune resistance
showing synergistic effects with chemotherapy and immunotherapy, c) decrease the amount of chemotherapy
needed, thus lowering the toxic side effects. Our in vivo results with human high grade glioma tumors in mice
treated with one of our ecGRP78 inhibitors displayed an increase in pathological complete responses of over
65% and an increase in median survival of 12 days or an estimated 2 years for human patients with no observable
toxicity. A non-toxic therapeutic alternative effective against recurrent brain tumors and brain metastasis
with increased overall survival and complete responses would prove to be paradigm altering."
11006936,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death among people with HIV (PWHIV), and the risk of morbidity and
mortality is also high among young children and pregnant women. TB preventive therapy (TPT) to treat TB
infection (TBI) is especially important in these priority populations, but it must be safe and well-tolerated given
that TPT is largely provided to asymptomatic, healthy individuals. The Tuberculosis Trials Consortium (TBTC)
of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is conducting ASTERoiD, a Phase 3 trial of rifamycin-
based TPT comparing six weeks of daily rifapentine (6wP) with local rifamycin-based standard of care (once-
weekly isoniazid and rifapentine for twelve weeks, 3HP; four months of daily rifampin (4R), or 3 months of daily
isoniazid and rifampin (3HR)). There are currently no pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments in ASTERoiD, and
optimal dosing of dolutegravir in PWHIV and rifapentine in priority populations in the context of 6wP has not
been firmly established. For this reason, PWHIV taking dolutegravir, children < 12 years, and pregnant women
are currently excluded from ASTERoiD We propose to enroll PWHIV taking DTG, children, and pregnant
people into a 6wP semi-intensive PK sub-cohort to confirm that model-informed doses of TB and HIV drugs
achieve target exposures in these participants (Aim 1). We will employ sparse PK sampling and use population
PK modeling to characterize exposure to rifapentine, explore sources of PK variability, and confirm that
translational modeling-informed dosing achieves clinical exposure targets in the majority of participants taking
6wP for TPT (Aim 2). We will evaluate TB drug exposures and pharmacogenetics as explanatory factors for
drug discontinuation due to adverse drug reactions, as well as other safety and tolerability outcomes, in both
the experimental and control arms in ASTERoiD (Aim 3). Finally, nesting clinical pharmacology into ASTERoiD
will provide us with the opportunity to understand whether or not key outcomes are related to drug exposures
and, importantly, will allow us to include key populations with the highest risk of TB disease and TB-related
morbidity and mortality into this Phase 3 trial of 6wP, an ultra-short, single-agent TPT that, if successful, could
transform TB prevention."
11006944,"Abstract
Relapsed and refractory T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and T-cell lymphoma (TCL) are aggressive
hematologic malignancies with limited therapeutic options and 3-year survival rates below 20 percent. While the
development of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies have shown promise in B-cell cancers, targeting
T-cell malignancies has been hindered by the shared antigen space between healthy and malignant cells leading
to CAR T cell self-targeting and a heightened risk of T- cell aplasia.
CD5 and CD7 are key surface markers for T-ALL/TCL, with about 90% of T-cell malignancies expressing one or
both markers. The autologous CD5.CAR-T and CD7.CAR-T cell therapies developed at Baylor College of
Medicine and licensed to March Biosciences show safety, feasibility, and signs of durable efficacy in Phase 1
clinical trials for T-cell malignancies. However, these trials have faced manufacturing challenges in many patients
and benefits to others have been abrogated by antigenically heterogenous tumors. To overcome these limitations
and enhance anti-tumor activity against T-cell cancers, March Biosciences proposes to develop partially-
matched donor-derived, dual-specific CAR-T cells (CD5/CD7.CAR-T cells). These CD5/CD7.CAR-T cells are
uniquely engineered for fratricide resistance and are produced from haploidentical, CD45RA-depleted donor T-
cells (RAD-T) to minimize the risk of graft versus host disease using a rapid current good manufacturing practice
(cGMP) compliant process. Safety and controllability will be further augmented by integrating a drug-inducible
caspase 9 (iC9) system allowing precise in vivo control of CAR-T cells post-infusion. This project aims to develop
CD5/CD7.CAR.RAD-T cells for highest activity against malignant T-cells with varying antigen expression in both
in vitro and in vivo models, and to demonstrate controlled CAR-T cell elimination by activating the caspase 9-
induced apoptosis. To streamline CAR-T cell production and reduce costs for optimal scalability, March
Biosciences is optimizing cGMP process to accelerate the manufacturing of CD5/CD7.CAR.RAD-T cells. By
transitioning to a rapid, closed-circuit system, March Biosciences seeks to consolidate T-cell stimulation,
transduction, and expansion into a single vessel over 4 days. The target total production timeline is 9 days
inclusive of final release testing thus ensuring a potent and rapidly available product for patients with aggressive
disease. Upon completion of this project, March Biosciences will have selected a lead candidate and finalized a
cGMP-ready process for manufacturing dual-targeting CAR-Ts enabling subsequent clinical testing in Phase 1/2
trials in patients with refractory and relapsed T-cell malignancies."

Venova Technologies is a women-led and minority-led medical device startup company, developing an
innovative non-hormonal female contraceptive device designed to be long-acting and side-effect-free. Venova
is applying for a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I grant to advance the development of our
patent-pending technology in anticipation of future biocompatibility testing and clinical trials. Over the past
several decades, contraceptive innovation has primarily targeted new delivery modes of hormones that follow
the same mechanism of action as the birth control pill, which was FDA approved sixty years ago. Despite the
availability of numerous types of contraception, many women remain dissatisfied and will discontinue birth
control use; in many cases, the side effects are unacceptable, and the available methods do not meet their
needs and preferences. The majority of effective contraceptive methods contain hormones and are associated
with menstrual changes, such as irregular or prolonged bleeding or amenorrhea. The only highly effective,
non-hormonal method in the US is the copper intrauterine device (IUD) which is associated with increased
menstrual bleeding and painful menstruation. Although other non-hormonal options (such as condoms, cervical
caps, diaphragms, and spermicides) do not alter menstruation, they tend to have high failure rates. Although
many women prefer non-hormonal methods, the choice to avoid side effects comes with a higher risk of
pregnancy. Venova is developing a first-in-class, long-acting, reversible solution to address the critical unmet
need for birth control options without hormonal and copper side effects. Our device does not interfere with the
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis nor interrupt natural menstrual cycles, and it acts prior to fertilization. We
have demonstrated, through proof-of-concept studies in simulation models, ex vivo studies using excised
human uterine tissues, and a pilot preclinical study in nonhuman primates, that our device (1) functions under
simulated physiological conditions, (2) can be placed and retained in human tissues, and (3) can be tolerably
worn in vivo during menses and will not alter the vaginal microbiome, induce an inflammatory response, nor
cause uterine and cervical tissue necrosis. In this SBIR Phase I program, Venova will continue to improve and
de-risk their contraceptive innovation through iterative design cycling using robust acceptance criteria to
enhance its barrier efficiency and insertion reliability. Success in this project will enable Venova to continue with
biocompatibility testing and apply for FDA approval to conduct pilot clinical studies in a future SBIR Phase II
program. Pilot clinical data will provide justification to partner with an established industry company to manage
pivotal clinical trials, navigate regulatory approvals, and market and distribute the devices to providers and
patients. Venova’s mission fully aligns with the NICHD Strategic Plan 2020 to address the unmet needs in
women’s reproductive health. Providing more user-focused and acceptable methods of contraception will have
immense positive health and socioeconomic benefits for women and their families."

 Caenorhabditis elegans is a mainstay of biomedical research and its growth as a model is likely to only
increase in time. In particular, C. elegans is used with great effect to study neuronal circuitry, cell development
and aging. However, as its use has increased, challenges with using C. elegans as a model have also made
themselves more evident. One particularly noteworthy challenge is the variability between studies in reported
wildtype animal lifespan, a common endpoint across disease models. Although it is conventionally known that
C. elegans under normative growth conditions live an average of 3 weeks, a recent meta-analysis of C. elegans
publications found that reported average ages ranged from 7 days to 35. The majority of C. elegans publications
report only minimal methodological and environmental data and concluded that most variation could be ascribed
to the accumulation of many small variables that often go unreported. As such, there is currently an unmet need
in the C. elegans aging field for a system to better improve the methodology of how C. elegans experiments are
conducted through removal of sources of variance and additional data recording and reporting.
 Ora Biomedical, Inc. is a longevity biotechnology company that identifies and develops small molecule
healthy aging therapeutics using large-scale, unbiased, live animal phenotypic analysis with lifespan as a primary
endpoint. We use custom built, fully scalable, automated state-of-the-art robotics and machine learning AI
combined with health and survival analysis to perform high-throughput preclinical gerotherapeutics development
that far surpasses the competition. With robust preclinical discovery at the heart of our approach, we identify
novel aging targets and new interventions for known targets. Importantly, we leverage large-scale operations to
perform drug-drug interaction studies to identify lifespan intervention combinations that produce breakthrough
increases in healthy lifespan.
 The overarching goal of this SBIR proposal is to use massively high-throughput preclinical drug testing in a
non-mammalian model system to identify compounds that extend organismal lifespan and/or effect the
progression of age-associated diseases. The specific goal of this SBIR Phase I proposal is to develop EleGantry,
a tool that will meet the need for improved rigor and reproducibility in C. elegans drug-discovery through
increased depth of data collected and automation of several key steps of the standard C. elegans pipeline. These
targeted steps that have a disproportionate large effect on the quality of C. elegans experimentation and
subsequently are often key sources of variability between studies. Additionally, EleGantry will allow the reporting
and publication of all of this valuable information so that replication of research and additional validation is made
as effective and efficient as possible."

 Electrical microstimulation has become a mainstay of fundamental neuroscience exploration and an
increasingly prevalent clinical therapy. Despite the growing prevalence of neuromodulation therapies, the
fundamental physiological and mechanistic properties driving the beneficial effect for the patient are poorly
understood. This R01 application aims to greatly improve our understanding of how different non-neuronal
cells (myeloid lineage, oligodendrocyte progenitor lineage, and vascular smooth muscle cells) respond and
contribute to the electrical stimulation response. Understanding of the relationship between stimulation
parameters and supporting non-neuronal cell activity, including blood flow, will help determine the impact of
electrical microstimulation on chronic circuit behavior in-vivo over time. In this proposal, we use leading-edge in
vivo multiphoton imaging techniques with multiple transgenic animals to systematically evaluate the
relationship between stimulation parameters and the induced changes over time at the molecular, cellular, and
local network. An improved understanding of the impact of electrical microstimulation on the overall tissue
health, changes to the foreign body response, stimulation of tissue repair, and safety limits will help inform
improved stimulation paradigms and device design for therapeutic applications and basic neuroscience
research."

There are ~7000 recognized rare diseases, which affect 5 - 10% of the U.S. population. The Undiagnosed Disease Network (UDN) is motivated by the dual goals of providing a diagnosis to patients who have undergone a protracted unsuccessful diagnostic odyssey and by the opportunities for scientific discovery that these unique patients offer. The UDNs impact also extends to systematizing the diagnostic approach to the undiagnosed patient. Our Pacific Northwest UDN site has served our region, and recently much of the Western United States, bringing a conclusion to the journey of our patients. Our group has deep and broad expertise across all the relevant areas required for the evaluation and diagnosis of adult and pediatric patients who have had a previously unproductive clinical odyssey, to identify novel disorders, and to advance the broader goals of the UDN. Foremost, we have a diverse team of physicians and an established record in the characterization of new genetic disorders and the identification of their genetic mechanisms. We leverage our unique existing regional medical and educational infrastructure, unique genomic strengths, and providers in the states of Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho to identify patients in need and provide regional care. Our clinicians include members with nationally recognized expertise in neurogenetics, adult and pediatric genetics/genomics, immunology, internal medicine, pediatrics, neurology, teratology, human development, dysmorphology, and neonatology. We have national expertise in genomic sequencing and annotation, copy number variant technology, data-sharing, clinical informatics, bioethics, molecular diagnostic testing, and statistical genetics; covering disciplines such as: bioethics, pharmacogenetics, genomics, environmental genetics, translational bioinformatics, health care outcomes, and policy. We serve a critical regional need."
10976565,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
This grant proposal outlines a comprehensive plan to develop novel computational methods and software tools
for analyzing pangenomic data, with a focus on improving the accuracy and efficiency of variant calling and
genotyping, particularly for complex structural variants (SVs). The proposal is divided into five specific aims:
Aim 1: Create a pangenome mapper supporting long-reads, which will enable accurate and efficient mapping
of long-range sequencing data to pangenome references.
Aim 2: Develop personalized pangenomes, which involves rapid and efficient construction of a subset of a
larger graph based on an input sample's k-mers. This approach will tailor the pangenome for specific analysis
and so lead to improved performance in downstream analysis.
Aim 3: Create a pangenome variant calling and imputation method for unified genome inference, which will
combine imputation with read-based genotyping using machine learning to infer a more complete
representation of variation, including both small variants and SVs.
Aim 4: Genotyping complex SVs involving protein-coding genes, which will involve identifying long segmental
duplications, grouping haplotypes, and developing targeted genotyping methods for long and short reads.
Aim 5: Develop mature rGFA based variant calling for reporting both SV and small variants within polymorphic
sequence, which will expand the current definition of reportable variation and provide pipelines that can report
tens of thousands of additional variations per sample.
The proposal highlights the need for better computational tools for pangenome analysis, especially for complex
SVs, and outlines a comprehensive plan to address these challenges. The proposed software tools and
methods will enable researchers to analyze pangenomic data more effectively and efficiently, leading to new
insights into genetic variation and its role in disease and other biological processes."
10976905,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Rural-serving primary care clinics in our Colorado Implementation Science Center in Cancer Control (COISC3)
seek to address inequities in behavioral cancer risks and unmet social needs. Clinics need efficient, low-cost
tools to screen for and address multiple risks at the same time — and technology can provide important
efficiencies. My Own Health Report (MOHR) is a web-based intervention with 3 core functions: 1) Risk
Flagging; 2) Goal-setting for patient-prioritized risks; 3) Service Linkage to resources. Our prior trial found that
patients receiving MOHR improved physical activity (p < 0.001) and diet (p < 0.001) behaviors that increase
the risk for many types of cancer; MOHR also showed improvements in other health behaviors and a signal of
reduced tobacco use (with a small n). Thus, MOHR has great potential to prevent cancer. However, we
identified two key gaps. First, our COISC3 clinics voiced a need for a more flexible menu of delivery options to
feasibly adopt and sustain the intervention. Second, to achieve equitable reach and effectiveness, particularly
for those with unmet social needs, clinics need to provide structured follow-up. Such follow-up increases
patient access to resources for behavioral risks and/or unmet social needs, thus “leveling the playing field” to
address cancer risks. Our new preliminary data show clinics and patients value MOHR with structured follow-
up strategies to remind patients of their goals and to provide relevant resources. We developed the
infrastructure for and pilot-tested two distinct implementation strategy bundles to provide this follow-up. The
first bundle, termed “Reminder-Resource message (R2 message),” involves electronic texts/e-mails sent
automatically by MOHR. The second bundle, “R2 Navigation,” trains staff in each clinic to personally deliver
these reminders and resources. Each strategy bundle addresses the contextual determinants of successful
implementation and sustainment identified in our Pragmatic Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model
(PRISM). However, the relative impact of R2 message, R2 Navigation, or their combination is unknown. In Aim
1, we will engage staff, patients, and partners in our COISC3 to finalize the implementation plans to deliver R2
message and R2 Navigation from a menu of options co-developed in preliminary workshops. In Aim 2, we will
conduct a randomized comparative effectiveness-implementation trial with 1,400 adult patients with two or
more cancer risks (including both insufficient physical activity and fruit/vegetable intake) across 7 COISC3
clinics to evaluate the comparative outcomes of R2 message and R2 Navigation alone or in combination. We
will assess multi-level outcomes, including: 1) Effectiveness, 2) Implementation, and 3) Practice Value
(including patient experience and costs). In Aim 3, we will use our iterative PRISM process to co-develop an
“implementation, adaptation and sustainment guide” for the most cost-effective implementation strategy
identified in Aim 2. Overall, we expect to reduce multiple cancer risks equitably, in part by addressing unmet
social needs, and to improve outcomes important to patients, primary care, and society."
10978144,"Project Summary/Abstract
This proposal targets the molecular basis of iron overload disorders and iron-restricted anemia, which are
among the most common hematological diseases worldwide. Recent studies have documented the iron-
regulatory hormone hepcidin as the key molecule responsible for systemic iron homeostasis. Hepcidin
expression is induced via the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-signaling pathway and requires the
involvement of other key plasma membrane proteins, including hemojuvelin (HJV), hemochromatosis protein
(HFE), transferrin receptor-2 (TfR2), and neogenin (NEO1). Mutations in the HJV, HFE, or TfR2 genes in
humans reduce hepcidin expression and cause hereditary hemochromatosis. Conversely, matriptase-2 (MT2)
is a robust suppressor for hepcidin expression. Mutations in the MT2 gene in humans result in increased
hepcidin expression, which leads to iron-refractory iron-deficiency anemia. However, the precise mechanisms
by which neogenin (NEO1) induces, MT2 suppresses, and iron modulates hepcidin expression are poorly
understood. Our long-term goal is to understand the mechanism of systemic iron homeostasis. The objective of
this grant is to characterize the coordination of NEO1, MT2, HJV, ALK3 (an essential BMP receptor for
hepcidin expression), BMPs, TfR2, HFE, and transferrin in the regulation of hepcidin by iron. Our central
hypothesis is that hepatic NEO1 acts as a scaffold and a signaling receptor to facilitate the formation of a key
hepcidin-inducing complex. The MT2 suppression and iron induction of hepcidin are achieved by modulating
this NEO1-containing complex. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of the data produced by the
applicants' and other laboratories. The rationale for the proposed research is that understanding the regulation
of hepcidin expression by iron has the potential to develop new therapies for iron overload disorders and iron-
restricted anemia. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific
aims: 1) Determine the mechanism by which hepatic NEO1 acts as a scaffold and a signaling receptor to
induce hepcidin expression. 2) Test the hypothesis that MT2 suppression and iron induction of hepcidin
expression are orchestrated by hepatic NEO1. The approach is innovative, because it focuses on the
mechanistic studies of NEO1 and MT2 in iron-regulated hepcidin expression at molecular, cellular, and
systemic levels. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to provide the basis for the
development of pharmacologic strategies. Successful completion of these studies will not only increase our
understanding of systemic iron homeostatic mechanism but also lay the foundation for translating these
advances into tangible benefits for patients with iron disorders."

Naming systems are crucial in all walks of life, especially in science and clinical medicine where accuracy and
reproducibility are vital. The HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) is the only group worldwide that
has provided standardized naming for human genes. HGNC’s symbols, names and identification numbers
(IDs) enable effective communication and exchange of information between anyone interested in genes. The
first aim of this application carries on this crucial work, focussing on naming newly identified protein coding loci,
both within the current reference genome and in new pangenome haplotypes, and continuing systematic
naming of pseudogenes and RNA genes. Utilizing data arising from a variety of methods including deep
learning we will continue to update nomenclature for newly characterised loci, genes with uninformative
placeholder symbols, and in rare cases where existing nomenclature is proven to be misleading. This aim also
recognises the need for stability in nomenclature, especially for genes associated with phenotypes. HGNC will
review protein coding genes with informative names and aim to stabilize symbols for the majority of well
characterized genes. Aim 2 will expand into the field of transcript naming; to date this has been restricted to a
very small set of complex loci (e.g. protocadherins). In collaboration with the biocuration groups from NCBI and
EMBL-EBI, HGNC will work with the community to establish guidelines for transcript naming, and provide
standardized names (and stable HGNC IDs) for well-defined transcripts. Aim 3 will pursue HGNC’s role in
coordinating gene naming across vertebrates, through collaboration with the existing nomenclature committees
for mouse, rat, chicken, Xenopus and zebrafish, and through work as the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature
Committee (VGNC). Established by the HGNC in 2016, to date the VGNC has named over 112,000 genes
across key species (chimpanzee, macaque, cattle, pig, horse, dog, cat), using a combination of automation
and manual curation. These efforts will be broadened to include naming in Chiroptera from the Bat 1K project,
both to expand VGNC’s taxonomic range and due to their intriguing antiviral immune responses. Building on
the HGNC and VGNC’s existing gene group resources, and in collaboration with experts, gene nomenclature
will be standardized across vertebrates in complex families including the C2H2 zinc fingers, immunity related
genes such as the MHC locus, and pharmacogenetically relevant genes. This aim will include development of
a pipeline for phylogenetic and syntenic analysis in complex families. In Aim 4 HGNC will engage with
stakeholders to encourage compliance with approved gene nomenclature, working with journal editors and
publishers. Awareness of HGNC’s resources, especially within the clinical community, will be raised via direct
engagement, and through channels such as Twitter/X and the genenames.org blog, while the number of video
tutorials will be expanded. The use of approved nomenclature is vital to avoid confusion and wasted
experiments in the laboratory, and to reduce the potential for patient harm."
10993571,"After spinal cord injury (SCI), the severe sub-lesion bone demineralization and impairment of bone
microarchitecture increases lower-limb fracture risk. Recent research has determined that in addition to
mechanical loading, bone homeostasis is mediated by myokines, skeletal muscle secreted signaling factors. The
myokine, irisin, produced via the cleavage of fibronectin type III domain containing protein 5 (FNDC5), has a
potent effect on bone formation. In animals, unloading reduces FNDC5 gene expression in correlation with
trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) loss implicating irisin/FNDC5 impairment as a mechanism contributing to
post-SCI bone loss. Additionally, increased circulating irisin has been demonstrated to attenuate bone loss when
provided during unloading and to stimulate bone growth when provided after a period of unloading. Thus, irisin
is a promising therapeutic approach for bone loss in individuals with SCI.
The goal of the proposed research is to further demonstrate that irisin is a key determinant of BMD, that impaired
irisin/FNDC5 mechanisms contribute to bone loss after-SCI, and discover novel modalities to leverage the
systemic osteogenic effects of irisin to improve musculoskeletal rehabilitation strategies for individuals with SCI.
The proposed research will demonstrate if circulating irisin concentrations and skeletal muscle FNDC5
expression are correlated with BMD and fracture risk, and if these correlations persist after SCI. Given that SCI
disproportionately affects trabecular bone, and impairs bone microarchitecture, high-resolution peripheral
quantitative tomography (HR-pQCT) will be used to assess trabecular and cortical BMD, and derive measures
associated with fracture risk including cortical porosity and bone failure load. Additionally, the proposed research
aims to demonstrate that FNDC5 expression is reduced in sub-lesion skeletal muscle of individuals with SCI,
likely due to SCI-induced fiber type changes. As exercise stimulates irisin release by skeletal muscle, and the
osteogenic benefits of exercise are partly mediated by irisin, reduced FNDC5 expression could attenuate the
efficacy of lower body exercise in individuals with SCI. Increases in circulating irisin induced by upper body
exercise could enhance the osteogenic efficacy of lower body exercise. Thus, the proposed research aims to
examine to effect of arm ergometer high-intensity interval exercise on circulating irisin. The findings of the
proposed research will determine if irisin/FNDC5 mechanisms contribute to post-SCI bone loss and the
attenuation of osteogenic responses lower body exercise-based interventions. Additionally, the findings will
determine if upper body exercise is a viable means to increase circulating irisin, and leverage the systemic
osteogenic effect of irisin to combat bone loss after SCI.
Dr. Sterczala’s background and training as an exercise physiologist has provided him with expertise regarding
exercise prescription and programming, and the assessment of performance and skeletal muscle adaptations to
exercise. This career development award would provide training in advanced techniques related to the
assessment of bone mineral density, bone microarchitecture and the quantification of bone biomechanical
properties. Additionally, it would provide training related to the pathophysiology of SCI and current rehabilitative
strategies to improve cardiometabolic and musculoskeletal health in individuals with SCI. His mentorship team
has extensive experience conducting research with individuals with SCI, designing innovative exercise-based
approaches to improve health and quality of life for Veterans, as well as bone, endocrine, and skeletal muscle
analyses to better understand the impact of exercise and pathophysiological states on health. The mentorship
team and training activities would aid Dr. Sterczala achieve his goals of becoming an independent research
scientist with a focus on determining how signaling factors secreted by skeletal muscle and bone influence
musculoskeletal health and how these factors may be leveraged to develop innovative rehabilitative strategies
to combat disuse associated musculoskeletal impairment."
10993573,"Background: Women’s health care within the VA is at a pivotal juncture. By 2040, the proportion of Veterans
who are women is expected to nearly double, from 9% (2018) to 17%. Distinct from men, women Veterans
(WV) are more racially and ethnically diverse, younger, and more likely to be single heads of households; all of
which have implications for health care engagement. The shift in age portends increasing women-specific
preventive and reproductive health care needs and a growing burden of chronic illnesses. Significance: These
shifts in the WV population require the VHA to innovate and adapt to continue to meet WV health care needs.
Virtual care will be a part of ongoing health care service changes and innovations, and has shown specific
potential for WV. However, we do not know how and when to deploy virtual care to optimize patient
engagement and clinical outcomes for WV. Addressing key areas of uncertainty in virtual VHA care
deployment for women could accelerate strategic utilization and successful implementation of virtual care for
WV, thereby improving patient satisfaction, quality of care, and health outcomes. This project addresses the
legislative priorities of the Deborah Sampson Act (H.R.2452); HSRD priorities of women's health, Virtual Care,
health equity; and ORD priorities of promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion, as well as leveraging VA
research for real-world impact. Innovation and Impact: Our proposal has four key areas of scientific
innovation, including: 1) advancing comprehensive, women’s care delivery by completing the first synthesis of
qualitative literature around women’s experiences with virtual care; 2) addressing key information gaps
identified by a recent VHA virtual care multi-stakeholder think tank; 3) advancing the science of qualitative
evidence synthesis through innovative incorporation of stakeholder input; and 4) bridging a methodologic gap
for translating implementation strategies into real-world actions. Specific Aims: 1) To identify barriers and
facilitators to the adoption and sustainability of appropriate virtual care delivered within comprehensive WHCs;
2) To develop an implementation blueprint for how and when to optimize adoption and sustainability of
appropriate virtual care in the context of VA comprehensive women’s health care; and 3) To explore the impact
of the novel implementation blueprint on use of appropriate virtual care in comprehensive WHCs using a mixed
methods field test design. Methodology: For Aim 1, we will review the qualitative peer-reviewed literature on
women’s experiences with virtual care, as well as collect primary qualitative data from marginalized women
Veteran populations (eg., Black WV, rural women) and their care providers to fill gaps in existing literature and
explore the specific VA context of synchronous virtual care for WV. For Aim 2, we will map barriers and
facilitators to relevant strategies and outcomes for implementation, and engage key multi-level stakeholders to
define actionable applications of identified strategies within comprehensive WHCs. For Aim 3, we will work with
the VA Women’s Health Practice Based Research Network and the Office of Rural Health to identify two
comprehensive women’s health clinics with which to conduct an evaluation of the implementation blueprint.
primary qualitative interviews and clinical providers of WV health care. Implementation: The product of this
work will be a blueprint for when and how to incorporate synchronous virtual care into comprehensive care for
WV. We will maintain close communication with our operations partners from the Office of Connected Care,
Office of Rural Health, and Women’s Health Services throughout the proposed work and plan iteratively with
them for dissemination. Ultimately, this proposed work has the potential to improve effectiveness of, and
satisfaction with, comprehensive care for WV within the VA by delivering health care at the right time with the
right modality for the clinical situation and patient's needs."
10993956,"Summary. This proposal seeks to test whether mechanical affinity of the complex between RGD, a tripeptide
domain found in proteins of extracellular medium, and integrin, a cell membrane receptor protein, is correlated
with cell migrations. By attaching the RGD ligand to a magnetic bead via a DNA handle, integrins on cell
surface can be evaluated for their binding affinity to the RGD by mechanically pulling away the binding
complex using a pair of magnets in magnetic-tweezers instrument. During the pulling, a camera in the
magnetic-tweezers setup is employed to record the distance between the magnetic bead and the magnet pair,
which is converted to the binding force at the time of bead detachment. The same camera is also used to
simultaneously monitor cell morphology changes that are related to cell migrations. Such a setup allows to
correlate the mechanical affinity of the RGD-integrin complex to the cell migration. This new technique has also
been successful in measuring the extraction force of lipid molecules such as cholesterol away from the cell
membrane.
Cholesterol is a critical component to increase the rigidity of the lipid rafts in the cell membrane. Cell migration
is shown to be inhibited when lipid rafts are dissolved. Cell membrane receptors such as EGFR, HER2, and
CD36 are found within lipid rafts. They may be impacted by compromised lipid rafts after cholesterol depletion.
All these three receptors play a role in cell migration through cell signaling pathways such as the Src-Fak axis.
We propose that these receptors may induce changes in cell migration when the structure and property of lipid
rafts are altered by factors such as cholesterol supplement/depletion or overexpression/knock-down of
EGFR/HER2/CD36 receptors. Integrin-RGD mechanical affinity will be used as a marker to follow changes in
cell migration as integrin binds to the extracellular matrix via peptide domains such as RGD. When lipid rafts
change their properties, integrin-RGD mechanical affinity may alter, which leads to variation in cell migration.
Previously, mechanical affinity has been shown to correlate with binding affinity; however, it is unknown if
mechanical affinity coordinates with intracellular signaling. By depleting cholesterol, migration will be inhibited.
We expect that supplementation of cholesterol after depletion may restore cell migration. To investigate this
restoration, we will evaluate changes in cell migration at either extracellular or intracellular level. At the
extracellular level, we will again use the mechanical affinity of integrin-RGD as a marker for cell migration. At
the intracellular level, western blot analysis will be used to follow changes in cell signaling by monitoring
expression levels of phosphorylated proteins associated with cell migration. We aim to test if extracellular
mechanical binding force corresponds with intercellular signaling as changes in migration occur. In summary,
we will evaluate cell migration using integrin-RGD mechanical affinity when changes in lipid raft composition
occur (Aim 1) and test if changes in mechanical affinity correspond with cell signaling intensity (Aim 2)."
10993965,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) is a hematologic malignancy characterized by the clonal outgrowth of
hematopoietic cells with a somatically acquired mutation most commonly in JAK2 (JAK2V617F), which leads to
excessive production of myeloid lineage cells. Patients with early stage MPN can spontaneously progress to
myelofibrosis, a more aggressive stage of the disease with an average survival rate of two years. Moreover,
MPN patients have a significant risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The traditional approach to
therapy in MPN is simply to reduce the risk of blood clots with aspirin, manage symptoms, and observe for
progression of the disease. Therapeutic intervention is focused on patients with late stage disease, mostly due
to the lack of currently available therapies that halt progression. There is thus a need for interventions that impact
disease progression in MPN. Preliminary work by the laboratory of Dr. Fleischman, in collaboration with
mathematical modelers Komarova and Wodarz, has shown that inflammation can accelerate the growth rate of
JAK2V617F mutant cells relative to JAK2WT cells, and that this can potentially have a variety of consequences for
the evolution of mutant cells at homeostasis. This suggests the possibility of a new treatment modality for early
stage MPN, in which the evolutionary fate of the JAK2V617F mutants is altered and disease progression is delayed
or halted. The overall goal of this proposal is to investigate how this can be achieved. In Aim 1, experiments are
proposed that document the dynamics of JAK2WT and JAK2V617F mutant cells in isolation with and without
inflammation for the purposes of model construction and parameterization. We will also interrogate the
intracellular mechanisms responsible for the differential response of JAK2V617F mutants to inflammation. In Aim
2 we will perform experiments in which JAK2WT and JAK2V617F mutant cells are combined in mouse models with
and without inflammation. This will quantify how the number of mutants influence the kinetic parameters of wild-
type cells, which is important because we know that mutants themselves can increase inflammation and hence
alter the dynamics. In Aim 3 we will measure how a panel of existing drugs impact the kinetic parameters of cells
and use our model to predict combinations and dosing schedules that will lead to diminution of the mutant cells.
Many treatment scenarios (in sequence and in combination) will be explored, and the most promising therapeutic
approaches predicted by the model will be tested experimentally. This can identify better and currently unknown
ways in which to utilize existing drugs. On a more exploratory level, the validated mathematical model can
suggest which parameter(s) to target in which ways to make treatment more efficient than can be currently done.
This information would facilitate development of future treatments and guide drug discovery and could be
translated into a future clinical trial."

3D Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis to enhance the rigor of motoneuronal somatic reconstruction and
potassium channel characterization. Clinical Relevance: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has few
therapies with only modest benefits despite decades of research. Barriers arise from complex, multifarious
pathologies and conflicting reports in the ALS literature, often due to inconsistent methods and unaccounted
for biological variables. Parent grant data implicates Kv2.1 and SK potassium ion channels in the excitability
dysregulation of motoneurons (MNs) in ALS, specifically in SOD1-G93A and rNLS8 ALS mouse lines. The
objective of this research is to develop novel 3D IHC analysis methods to rigorously examine somatic
morphology and potassium channel structure in normal vs. diseased states to elucidate the roles of Kv2.1
and SK in ALS. Rationale: Current 2D IHC methods do not provide accurate measures of soma size or ion
channel structure. Also, standard manual tracing to assess 2D area involves human bias. Notably, MN soma
volume indicates vulnerability to ALS (largest cells die first). Also, the soma surface area impacts membrane
capacity for ion channels. Thus, 3D somatic measurements are vital to the parent grant. Also, the multiple,
complex roles of potassium channels in regulating MN excitability, and the fact that these channels are
understudied in spinal MNs, makes rigorous characterization of Kv2.1 and SK critical to the parent grant’s
work. Thus, our Specific Aims are: SA 1) Develop algorithms for accurate 3D reconstruction and
measurement of MN somas in IHC: 2D soma measurements require subjective and tedious manual cell
body tracing, which is sensitive to human error and biased by image orientation. Also, current 3D software-
renderings are low-resolution and insufficient for 3D ion channel quantitation. Thus, the candidate will develop
unbiased algorithms to automatically trace the 3D somatic membrane and quantitate soma volume and
surface area. SA 2) Rigorously characterize somatic potassium channel structure and calibrate
analysis to known channel phosphorylation states in healthy spinal MNs: Kv2.1 and SK structure each
exhibit a structural range from tightly clustered to loosely dephosphorylated depending on their functional
state. These graded clustering changes are not thoroughly characterized by visual inspection, as proposed
in the parent grant. Thus, the candidate will develop quantitation algorithms for 3D intensity maps to
characterize Kv2.1 and SK structure. SA 3) Characterize Kv2.1 and SK structure in ALS spinal MNs: While
Kv2.1 and SK qualitative structural changes have been observed across healthy cell function, both channels
have been understudied in ALS and never characterized in rNLS8 specifically. Thus, we will rigorously
characterize Kv2.1 and SK clustering changes in rNLS8 MNs and compare/contrast these changes to those
measured in SOD1 MNs. Completion of these studies will link potassium channel structure changes to
functional changes in both SOD1 and rNLS8 MNs, thus elucidating Kv2.1 and SK’s role in ALS."

The overarching goal of this study is to identify effective metabolic based diagnostic and therapeutic strategies
to improve the overall survival of patients with Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We propose to investigate
the positron emission tomography (PET) tracer, 18F-BnTP as a novel metabolic diagnostic and to develop
metabolic based therapeutic strategies targeting oxidative mitochondrial metabolism in therapy resistant
KRAS/LKB1 and EGFR mutant lung tumors. NSCLC will claim the lives of ~130,000 in the US in 2021. Lung
tumors frequently possess a high mutational burden, often rendering single agent therapies targeting
oncogenic driver mutations unsuccessful. Furthermore, metabolically active subsets of lung adenocarcinomas
(LUADs) bearing mutations in KRAS and LKB1 or EGFR are frequently resistant to immunotherapy
approaches. However, regardless of the initials benefits from checkpoint inhibitors or targeted therapies, the
majority of patients will eventually develop resistance to therapy. We rationalize a different approach to
overcoming therapy resistance in NSCLC – namely the classification of tumors by their metabolic signature.
Here, tumors are grouped and targeted by their metabolic dependencies rather than solely by their genetic
alterations. NSCLC is a metabolically heterogeneous disease and tumors utilize both glycolytic and oxidative
mitochondrial metabolism to grow. The mitochondria are the site of cellular bioenergetics and oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and are essential for lung tumor initiation and maintenance. Due to a lack of in
vivo imaging probes there is a gap in our knowledge at a physiological and mechanistic level of how
mitochondrial bioenergetics are regulated in NSCLC. To address this gap, we functionally imaged
mitochondrial activity in lung tumors utilizing the PET imaging tracer 18F-BnTP and demonstrate that it
functions an in vivo biomarker of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ) and oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS) in lung tumors3. Importantly, by using 18F-BnTP PET imaging we are able to distinguish between
OXPHOS dependent and independent lung tumors. Therapeutically, we have demonstrated that 18F-BnTP
positive, OXPHOS-dependent LUADs are sensitive to mitochondrial complex I inhibitors. We hypothesize that
18F-BnTP PET imaging can be utilized to functionally profile mitochondrial bioenergetics and adaptive oxidative
metabolism in therapy-resistant lung tumors to guide treatment with OXPHOS inhibitors. In aim 1 we will
perform an in vivo dissection of mitochondrial bioenergetics in therapy-resistant LUADs. In aim 2 we will
perform a structural and functional in vivo analysis of adaptive oxidative metabolism in therapy-resistant
KRAS/LKB1 and EGFR mutant LUADs. In Aim 3 we will longitudinally profile oxidative metabolism in LUAD
patients with advanced disease. The proposed work has relevance to human health in which we propose that
18F-BnTP PET imaging guided targeting and oxidative metabolism represents a new therapeutic strategy to
overcome therapy resistance in patients with KRAS/LKB1 and EGFR mutant tumors."

We aim to develop a short course titled “Trauma-Informed Data Science and Digital Health Technologies to
Prevent Intimate Partner Violence among Pregnant/Postpartum Women” that will train a new generation of
researchers in specialized research techniques, such as big data analytics and digital health technologies, to
measure or predict intimate partner violence (IPV) more accurately and develop accessible, trauma-informed
digital tools to support IPV survivors of underrepresented pregnant/postpartum women. We propose this
course as an effort to mitigate the existing limitations in measuring, screening, and intervening with IPV to
prevent IPV and reach out to more vulnerable survivors for support. There are multiple barriers (e.g., stigma
and shame) to collecting reliable data from survivors, resulting in small samples without enough statistical
power and, thereby, discouraging the analysis of subgroups of underrepresented women with intersecting
identities. Additionally, the existing interventions/services lack scalability because most services are responsive
vs. proactive and offered in person, reducing the accessibility to these resources among hard-to-reach
survivors. Ethical use of data science and digital health technologies will be innovative research tools for
targeted yet wide-reach preventive strategies for survivors of underrepresented pregnant/postpartum women.
The ethical use indicates factoring in the unintended consequences of employing big data analytics and digital
health technologies and applying trauma-informed principles in the research processes and products. Our
specific aims are (i) training researchers in big data analytics to work with complex data containing IPV,
pregnancy-related, and social determinants of health variables from various sources; (ii) teaching them the
best practices to develop, deploy, and disseminate digital tools (e.g., mobile app and game) that are trauma-
informed; (iii) instructing them conducting ethical research acknowledging the importance of digital security and
privacy in working with IPV survivors. This 6-month education program will welcome trainees with diverse
backgrounds from across the country for hybrid online learning (combination of asynchronous and
synchronous) and intensive, hands-on curriculum to maximize the effectiveness of the training, wide reach to
target groups, and readily disseminate the course. Year 2 will repeat the Year 1 curriculum with its refinement
based on the trainees’ feedback. The program will also involve working groups, in which trainees will generate
research ideas and apply the knowledge and skills obtained from the course for manuscripts or grants, as well
as networking opportunities for mentorship and collaboration. This program will be held at the Emory University
School of Nursing, leveraging its rich institutional and human resources, including the current T32 program
focusing on women’s health and data science. By bringing together training, research, and networking, we will
create a long-lasting community of scholars who can engage in data-driven interdisciplinary research for years
to come to prevent IPV-associated maternal morbidity and mortality."

hiring of a FIRST Cohort of diverse faculty. Cornell’s FIRST program features interdisciplinary hiring of
faculty underrepresented in their fields, across six colleges and 20 departments, with a focus on retention,
career development, and evaluation. Cornell proposes 1) to hire a diverse cohort of 10 new faculty into
3 research clusters, taking advantage of Cornell’s existing interdisciplinary field system approach where
faculty are organized by research interest rather than by department, within broad areas of quantitative
biomedical sciences, infection biology, and health equity; 2) foster sustainable institutional culture

In nature and human microbiomes, microbes regularly face challenges due to fluctuations in the availability of
resources and nutrients - a lifestyle termed feast/famine. Previous studies investigating microbial adaptation to
feast/famine have focused on the specific adaptations that allow microbes to survive extreme starvation, often
overlooking how the eventual replenishment of resources affects evolution. However, due to evolutionary
tradeoffs between growth and survival, the molecular, cellular, and behavioral phenotypes that evolve in
response to feast/famine may vary based on the duration and severity of starvation. Common adaptations to
resource limitation include expanding metabolic capability through nutritional competence and increasing
efficiency by diversification into cross-feeding ecotypes. As microbial metabolism can be constrained by many
biologically relevant factors, including the presence of oxygen, this can complicate evolution and limit potential
adaptive trajectories. Research in my lab focuses on how microbes adapt and diversify in novel complex
environments by applying multi-omic, systems microbiology approaches to experimental evolution. We plan to
investigate how oxygen availability shapes microbial evolution to feast/famine by conducting an adaptive
laboratory evolution experiment with two bacterial species, the facultative anaerobe Escherichia coli, and the
fastidious aerotolerant anaerobe Lactobacillus crispatus. We will characterize populations for fitness outcomes,
common adaptive mutations, and patterns of diversification to determine how oxygen influences adaptation to
feast/famine conditions. We will follow up by characterizing the effects of common adaptive mutations on
microbial physiology using transcriptomics and high-throughput phenotyping. Further, as oxygen can shift the
topography of the adaptive landscape by affecting the rate and spectra of mutations, we will also perform
mutation accumulation experiments on facultatively anaerobic, aerotolerant anaerobic, and obligately
anaerobic bacterial species in the presence and absence of oxygen. Studies of microbial evolution have
historically neglected fastidious microorganisms and anaerobic environments due to the challenges associated
with their culture. Our research will provide fundamental knowledge about evolutionary processes in a
neglected fraction of the microbial tree of life that accounts for a significant proportion of the human
microbiome."

Heavy, problematic alcohol use is highly prevalent within individuals receiving medications for opioid use disorder
(MOUD) and contributes to increased risk of opioid overdose and poorer MOUD treatment outcomes. The
recently proposed CANUE model (Catastrophizing, Anxiety, Negative Urgency, and Expectancy) suggests that
emotional pain (or psychological distress) is a robust proximal antecedent to alcohol and opioid use via negative
reinforcement. More importantly, the CANUE model posits that several modifiable risk factors influence ‘self-
medication’ of emotional pain with alcohol during MOUD. Two key factors implicated in this model are anxiety
sensitivity (AS) and intolerance of uncertainty (IU) which are theorized to independently and synergistically
interact to amplify the negative reinforcement cycle of addiction and play a unique role in alcohol use during
MOUD. Along these lines, our team has developed a brief, digitally-enhanced, virtual psychotherapeutic
intervention called IMPROVE: Managing Physical Reactions to Overwhelming Emotions. IMPROVE is
associated with large reductions in IU and AS in college students with elevated anxiety. The overall objective of
this proposal is to further develop and refine IMPROVE to be used as a brief intervention to reduce alcohol use
among individuals engaged in MOUD. We will also use this planning project to collect preliminary data on
whether changes in AS/IU targets are linked to changes in alcohol use. This R34 study will lay the groundwork
for a large-scale clinical trial of IMPROVE to reduce heavy drinking and enhance MOUD outcomes. The current
study will leverage the infrastructure of our university-based addiction treatment center and a community partner
to complete two study phases. In Phase One (Aim 1; Year 1) we will adapt IMPROVE’s content, delivery, and
digital tools using the Delphi method with key experts and stakeholders. We will also develop an implementation
protocol through field usability sessions. Aim 1 will yield a customized, feasible, and acceptable IMPROVE
package ready for implementation. In Phase Two (Years 2-3) we will conduct a pilot randomized control trial of
the adapted IMPROVE protocol as compared to our active control intervention on drinking behavior in individuals
receiving MOUD. Heavy alcohol users receiving MOUD will be assigned to IMPROVE or a control health
promotion intervention (N=40 per arm). All participants will complete daily ecological momentary assessments
(EMA) delivered to participants’ mobile phones to capture real-world alcohol use before, during, and after the
intervention. We will evaluate the impact of IMPROVE (vs. control) on daily alcohol use (primary) and MOUD
adherence (secondary), and explore treatment-related changes in the antecedents of drinking behavior (Aim 2).
Phase Two will also include a multimodal battery of self-report and objective lab-based measures of AS and IU
involving startle eyeblink potentiation and event-related potentials via electroencephalography (EEG). This will
allow us to examine whether IMPROVE changes IU and AS, and to assess if changes in these targets are
associated with changes in alcohol use (primary) and MOUD adherence (secondary) (Aim 3)."

Maintenance of a non-human primate specific pathogen free (SPF) breeding colony requires several factors to
ensure the animals’ physical and behavioral health, breeding production, genetic diversity, and exclusion of
specified pathogens. The pigtailed macaque, M. nemestrina, exhibits certain physical and behavioral
characteristics that pose additional challenges in colony maintenance. M. nemestrina show greater susceptibility
to the pathogenic effects of many microorganisms. Their susceptibility to lentiviruses makes them valuable
animal models for HIV/AIDS research. However, nonhuman primates (NHP) in standard outdoor breeding
colonies are exposed to environmental pathogens, such as Coccidioides posadasii, and M. nemestrina
demonstrate enhanced susceptibility to disease with such exposure. Care must also be taken to prevent M.
nemestrina infants from hypothermia. In contrast to rhesus macaques (M. mulatta) which exhibit seasonal
breeding, infant M. nemestrina are born year-round and must be maintained in a heated environment when
outdoor temperatures are low. Breeding management also differs between M. mulatta and M. nemestrina. M.
mulatta can be bred in large multi-male, multi-female groups in large corrals with minimal infrastructure. In
contrast, M. nemestrina form single male multi-female fission/fusion groups in the wild and attempts to form
multi-male groups result in significant trauma. Even with stable, single-male breeding groups, productivity is
lower for M. nemestrina than for M. mulatta. The Washington National Primate Research Center (WaNPRC) has
over 50 years of breeding experience with M. nemestrina and has the expertise and resources to meet the
challenges breeding this species of macaque presents. With support from this U42 cooperative agreement, we
will maintain and enhance production of a healthy SPF M. nemestrina colony, including maintaining the animals
free of B virus, SIV, SRV, and STLV, along with control of environmental organisms, such as C. posadasii. We
will continue to meet the needs of HIV/AIDS investigators by providing SPF M. nemestrina to investigators in
accordance with NIH-directed priorities."

Psychosis is a serious mental disorder involving disruptions in neural processing that are poorly understood. In
addition to disrupted cognition, abnormal sensory processing is also found in psychosis, including distorted
perception and hallucinations. This proposal will apply tools from visual neuroscience in order to gain insight
into the neural basis of abnormal visual perception in psychosis. Because visual neural circuits are well-
understood in animal models, we will be able to test a very specific hypothesis about the nature of visual circuit
disruptions in psychosis; that this disorder is associated with abnormally weak early visual gain control. Gain
control is a neural process that prevents responses to strong visual stimuli from becoming too large. It is known
that in psychosis, some visual illusions are perceived as weaker than in healthy adults due to abnormally weak
gain control. We will use a visual paradigm designed to tap into particular neural circuits in combination with
EEG, in order to pinpoint the neural basis of this visual abnormality. In addition, we will acquire longitudinal
measures of visual gain control and psychosis symptoms, in order to test the hypothesis that weaker gain
control is associated with clinical deterioration. Finally, using functional MR spectroscopy, we will examine the
role of glutamate in occipital cortex during visual processing in psychosis. This work will elucidate the
pathophysiological mechanisms of psychosis, thereby facilitating the development of more precisely targeted,
etiologically-based treatments."
11006873,"SUMMARY - ABSTRACT
Thoracic aortic aneurysm is a highly prevalent disease which can lead to devastating complications including
dissection or rupture. Early detection and regular monitoring of these patients via regular surveillance imaging is
essential to guide therapy management. The current paradigm for risk assessment in these patients is based on
primitive size thresholds with poor predictive value for aortic complications. There is strong evidence that 4D
hemodynamic biomarkers are drivers of aortic complications and can improve risk assessment and therapy
management. To obtain these biomarkers, a highly specialized MRI technique - 4D flow MRI - is required which
allows for the direct in vivo measurement of aorta 4D hemodynamics. However, several limitations impede wider
clinical translation, including the lack of access to dedicated MRI systems and 4D flow MRI protocols,
burdensome and time-consuming (30+ minutes) post-processing, and interpretation of 4D flow data requiring
dedicated software and highly specialized expertise.
To address these limitations, Third Coast Dynamics is developing a cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI)-based
platform called TCDflow that can replace 4D flow MRI by providing 4D hemodynamic output directly from widely
available routine and easy-to-obtain clinical anatomic images of the chest. Our proof-of-concept studies have
leveraged a large database of >6700 existing 4D flow MRI patient data to develop a prototype TCDflow fluid
physics informed deep learning neural network for the prediction of 4D aortic hemodynamics using anatomic
images as input data. Further development, evidence generation, and steps toward commercialization will be
conducted in a two-phase approach. Phase 1 (P1) focuses on further development and fine-tuning of the This
Coast Dynamics analysis pipeline (P1, Aim 1). The technology will then be tested in a large, single center
(Northwestern) retrospective aorta outcomes study (P1, Aim 2). These developments and validation will provide
the foundation for Phase 2 which focuses on developing our clinician-facing cloud-based analysis platform and
report (P2, Aim 1), performing a large multicenter retrospective validation and outcomes study (P2, Aim 2),
completing an end-user TCDflow evaluation (P2, Aim 3), and securing FDA 510(k) clearance (P2, Aim 4). The
completion of the Phase 1 and 2 deliverables will result in an FDA-cleared product which can be readily
commercialized. All aims are designed with guidance from consultants with direct expertise in FDA 510(k)
clearance of digital health products.
The technology will provide improved personalized risk-stratification of aortic complications beyond the current
simple and insufficient clinical measures. Increasing operational efficiencies and reduced health care utilization
costs will be achieved by access to cloud-based 4D hemodynamic assessment by a wide range of patients and
healthcare providers without the need for highly specialized imaging equipment, training, and expertise."

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) affects up to 1:200 individuals and is a common cause of sudden cardiac
death. Guidelines recommend genetic testing in HCM probands to help establish diagnosis, inform risk
stratification, and identify at-risk relatives. However, causal variants are identified in fewer than half of patients,
many tests return variants of uncertain significance (VUS), and genotype-phenotype associations of known
genes are insufficiently characterized to inform medical management. In this proposal we address 4 gaps in
HCM research: 1) Most data are from individuals of European ancestry referred for genetic testing, creating bias
in estimates of the contribution, penetrance, and phenotype in the broader clinical and community population. 2)
Established HCM genes have insufficient genotype-phenotype data to inform gene-specific clinical management.
3) The evidence for most candidate genes is equivocal due to lack of study in cohorts sufficiently large to evaluate
pathogenicity. 4) Some disease loci likely remain undiscovered because GWAS and linkage approaches used
in prior studies are not well-powered for diseases, such as HCM, with variable age of onset, both high genetic
and allelic heterogeneity, and incomplete penetrance. We will address these fundamental knowledge gaps using
innovative genetic methods and a novel, large-scale HCM research platform that includes harmonized
phenotypic, genotyping, sequencing, and identity-by-descent (IBD) data from six large biobanks comprising
~1.5M participants and >5,000 HCM cases. Specifically, we propose to use rare variant and IBD-based methods
to: Aim 1) Define the contribution and phenotypic manifestations of established disease genes in multiple diverse,
non-referral HCM populations; Aim 2) Assess the pathogenicity of candidate HCM genes with equivocal evidence
and establish a novel platform to evaluate VUS in established genes; and Aim 3) Discover novel HCM loci via
IBD mapping and rare variant association within and across biobanks at scale. To balance the innovation of
these aims, we present compelling preliminary data demonstrating the feasibility of our approaches which
identified a cluster of distantly related individuals harboring a common pathogenic variant in a Mendelian
cardiomyopathy gene. We anticipate these analyses will substantially expand our understanding of the genetic
factors underlying HCM risk and their clinical manifestations. Once established, our platform will support future
clinical and genetic research and advance the long-term goal of implementing targeted interventions at the clinic
and population level to reduce the burden of HCM for all patients."
10999713,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Candida auris is an emerging drug-resistant fungal pathogen that is now endemic to all inhabited continents. C.
auris colonizes human skin with extraordinary tenacity, and skin colonization is key to both its high rate of person-
to-person transmission and the progression to infectious disease. There are currently no effective strategies to
reverse colonization, and very little is known about how C. auris interacts with the structural and immune
components of skin. Here we will leverage our team’s strengths across fungal pathogenesis and tissue
immunology to address the mechanism of C. auris skin colonization. In preliminary work, we developed mouse
models of C. auris skin colonization and rechallenge. We have begun to characterize C. auris behaviors on skin,
the host immune response, and have performed a screen for fungal mediators of skin association. Our major
findings include: 1) diverse clinical C. auris isolates exhibit enhanced skin colonization activity in mouse models
relative to Candida albicans, a second fungal pathobiont commonly found on human skin; 2) C. auris but not C.
albicans directly binds to hair and colonizes hair follicles in animals; 3) host immune responses to C. albicans
and C. auris are starkly different, with IL-17-driven type 3 immunity predominating in C. albicans, and IFNγ-
driven type 1 immunity predominating in C. auris; 4) IL-17 plays a far more modest role in restricting C. auris skin
colonization as compared with C. albicans, whereas IFNγ surprisingly enhances colonization by C. auris but not
C. albicans. We hypothesize that C. auris possesses unique virulence mechanisms that allow it to preferentially
colonize and survive in hair follicles, from where it drives a protective IFN-associated type 1 immune response.
Here, we propose to build on these observations to discover the mechanisms underlying C. auris’s enhanced
capacity for skin colonization, as well as the role of IFN𝛄𝛄 and IL-17A cellular sources and targets, with potentially
crucial implications for infection control and a broader understanding of how immune topography can impact skin
health and disease. The specific goals of this proposal are to (1) identify C. auris factors required for hair binding
and skin colonization, (2) decipher how type 1 lymphocytes and IFNγ signaling support C. auris skin colonization,
and (3) define how fungal effectors and skin immune pathways intersect."
10999782,"Patient genome sequencing has revealed germline genetic variation in DDX41 as one of the most frequent
genomic alterations implicated in creating a predisposition to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute
myeloid leukemia (AML). DDX41 encodes an RNA helicase that regulates RNA splicing, senses double-stranded
DNA, operates in the cGAS-Sting pathway and promotes innate immunity. Many questions remain regarding
DDX41 mechanisms and how genetic variants impact its functions. To gain fundamental and translational
insights, we engineered the genome of HoxB8-immortalized murine hematopoietic progenitor cells, which
recapitulate the phenotype of primary progenitors, to yield Ddx41+/- cells. We innovated a rescue system to
compare human DDX41 activity with that of clinical variants. Using an unbiased genomic strategy, we identified
DDX41-regulated mRNAs and membrane proteins as activity metrics. We will use our foundation and machine
learning to construct a matrix that informs the relationship between DDX41 and clinical variants of uncertain
significance (VUS) or those deemed pathogenic. Although DDX41 represents one of >60 DEAD box domain
(DDX) proteins, unifying principles are not established. Aim 1 will innovate a system to discriminate
pathogenic from benign human DDX41 clinical genetic variants. Using a prioritization strategy involving
genetic variation attributes, an ensemble of variants was assembled for analysis. We will use our DDX41 activity
metrics to create a matrix that establishes the functional signature of any variant. This will enable a classification
strategy to predict whether a variant resembles DDX41 (“DDX41-like”) or pathogenic variants (“path-DDX41”).
Activity metrics will be extended by quantitative proteomics to identify additional DDX41-regulated proteins and
advanced RNA-seq analyses to identify transcript isoforms. Loss-of-function and rescue studies will determine
if activity metrics can be extrapolated to primary hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Aim 2 will conduct
pilot/exploratory studies on a mechanism involving DDX41-dependent alternative splicing at a locus
encoding an RNA splicing factor-regulatory kinase. Our results revealed that DDX41, but not a pathogenic
variant, promotes intron retention in Clk3 RNA, and DDX41 elevates the CDC-like Kinase-3 (CLK3) protein level
in myeloid cells. The CLK3 kinase phosphorylates splicing factor (SR) proteins SRSF1-12, some of which are
implicated in MDS and AML. We hypothesize that DDX41-induced intron retention and elevated CLK3 protein
have important functional consequences. We will test models to explain the consequences of Clk3 intron
retention and CLK3 protein elevation. The studies will establish a foundation to understand the DDX41-CLK3
mechanism, which may have considerable physiological and pathological impact. The rules governing DDX41
function and dysfunction that emerge will advance patient genetic curation and mechanistic logic to inform future
lines of biological (e.g., hematology- and immunology-focused) and pathological (e.g., bone marrow failure/MDS)
investigations in the contexts of erythroid and myeloid biology and more broadly."
10999918,"Abstract: 3D human neurocircuits to determine the role of microglia in AUD and Alzheimer’s neuronal
pathology. Altered neuronal metabolism, neuronal activity, and neurodegeneration are key features in both
alcohol use disorder (AUD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). AUD and AD are linked, with alcohol related brain
damage (ARBD) being one of the strongest risk factors for AD. However, the mechanisms underlying altered
neuronal metabolism in these diseases, and its impacts on neuronal activity and neurodegeneration are
unknown. We reported that proinflammatory microglia promote ARBD and alcohol-enhancement of AD
pathology. We now find that microglia promote lipid accumulation in neurons with alcohol. Therefore, we
hypothesize that alcohol alters neuronal activity and survival to promote AUD and AD through a novel microglia-
neuronal metabolic link. In AUD and AD, brain glucose metabolism is reduced. ARBD correlates with this
reduction, suggesting metabolic changes promote pathology. Recent studies suggest microglia may also
contribute. Proinflammatory microglia undergo a glycolytic burst that can produce high levels of lactate and
express the lactate exporter MCT4. We hypothesize that the proinflammatory microglia induced by alcohol
deliver excess lactate to neurons, causing a metabolic imbalance that alters neuronal activity and promotes
neurodegeneration. Alcohol (i.e. ethanol) is metabolized by oxidative and non-oxidative pathways (OME and
NOME) to produce acetate and fatty-acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) respectively. Acetate is converted to lipids
through acetyl-coA. Microglia, but not neurons, have OME machinery. Thus, we hypothesize microglial OME
releases acetate to disrupt neuronal lipid metabolism. We recently found that accumulation of neuronal lipids
caused by alcohol promotes AD pathology. Amyloid-β (Aβ) is normally degraded within neurons by lysosomes.
Ethanol increased neuronal lysosomal lipid to cause lysosomal damage and prevent neuronal degradation of
intraneuronal Aβ. Inhibition of proinflammatory microglia prevented neuronal lipidosis, identifying microglia as
regulators of AD-promoting changes in neuronal metabolism. However, the mechanism underlying this microglia-
neuronal link in AD are unknown. Given the impact of ethanol on microglial activation, and consequences of
ethanol metabolism, we hypothesize energetic metabolites produced by microglial glycolysis as well as microglial
ethanol metabolism combine to produce neuronal lipidosis, lysosomal dysfunction, altered neuronal activity, and
neurodegeneration associated with AUD and AD. We propose to employ novel human 3D reciprocal brain
circuits (h3D-rC) to test the role of microglia in neuronal metabolism and activity (Aim 1-2), alcohol-induced
neurotoxicity (Aim 1) and Aβ accumulation (Aim 2). These reciprocal circuits are formed using human IPSC-
derived neurons grown in proprietary microfluidic culture platforms (XonaTM) that enable the bidirectional growth
of axons between two distinct compartments and mimics the three dimensional and multi-cellular features found
in vivo; it also reproduces the dynamics caused by both outgoing projections and inputs from other brain regions."
10999589,"Abstract
The intestinal epithelium serves essential functions of dietary nutrient absorption and defense against microbial
infections through the coordinated regulation of gene expression. Intestinal microbiota significantly influence
gene transcription in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), including both induction and suppression of distinct gene
sets. We have shown that many microbially-suppressed genes are under control of the host transcription factor
(TF) HNF4A and are involved in differentiation and metabolism of absorptive enterocytes. Microbially-induced
genes are predicted to be downstream of TF pathways including IRF and NFκB and include genes involved in
proliferation, inflammation, and immune defense. What remains unknown is if these distinct microbiota-induced
and microbiota-suppressed TF pathways communicate with each other and how they are balanced within IECs
to maintain intestinal homeostasis. Our preliminary studies have revealed that these two opposing TF
pathways directly communicate within IECs to promote homeostasis by regulating responses to microbes. We
find that HNF4A activity in mouse IECs is suppressed by microbiota and protects against microbiota-driven
intestinal inflammation. Using single cell RNA sequencing in wild-type gnotobiotic mice, we have uncovered
significant heterogeneity in gene expression profiles among enterocytes. For example, immune genes are
induced in enterocytes by microbiota and are negatively correlated with HNF4A-dependent genes, implying
divergent transcriptional programs. We also find that IEC-specific deletion of Hnf4a leads to induction of
immune genes and enhanced protection from enterovirus infection, further confirming a negative relationship
between HNF4A and immune programs. In accord, proteomic studies in gnotobiotic mouse IECs and pathway
manipulations in human cells revealed significant interactions between HNF4A and immune signaling pathway
components. These data support our central hypothesis that HNF4A and immune pathways represent distinct
microbiota-regulated enterocyte programs, and that HNF4A suppresses the immune program and thereby
increases vulnerability to enterovirus infection. To test this, we will define the roles of HNF4A in mediating the
impacts of microbiota on IEC gene regulatory programs and enterovirus infection. We will also identify the
molecular mechanisms by which HNF4A and immune pathways interact to regulate gene expression. The
expected outcomes will vertically advance the field in several ways. First, they will provide an in-depth
understanding of how interactions between the microbiota and HNF4A determine IEC differentiation, gene
expression, chromatin organization, and enterovirus infection. Second, they will yield unprecedented insights
into the molecular mechanisms by which HNF4A and immune pathways communicate within the same cell.
These results are expected to have a positive impact because they would provide important fundamental
knowledge about intestinal epithelial biology which could lead to the development of new diagnostic,
prognostic, and therapeutic approaches for human diseases such as enteric virus infections."
11006986,"7. Project Summary/Abstract
A key component in any investigation of association and/or cause-effect relationships between the
environment and health outcomes is the availability of accurate and precise models of exposure. Because the
cost of collecting field data is often prohibitive, it is critical to incorporate any source of secondary information
available to supplement sparse datasets. Secondary data can take many forms (e.g., continuous or categorical
measurement scale), and display different levels of reliability: hard vs soft data (e.g., interval-type data,
probability distributions). Merging these different data layers while accounting for their spatial patterns,
compositional nature (case of categorical attributes) and local uncertainty is thus challenging. With the advent
of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning (ML), geostatistical predictive models have become
more sophisticated and effective. The marriage of geostatistics and AI empowers us to extract deeper insights
from spatial datasets, opening doors to predictive modeling, risk assessment, and optimized decision-making.
This SBIR project is developing the first commercial software to offer tools for soft indicator coding and non-
parametric geostatistical modeling of uncertainty, leveraging AI to analyze, interpret, and derive insights from
spatial data. The research product will be a stand-alone desktop (ST) analysis and visualization tool, building
on the legacy core software developed by BioMedware. These tools will be suited for the analysis of data
outside health sciences, such as in remote sensing, geochemistry, urban infrastructure or soil science,
broadening significantly the commercial market for the end product. This project will accomplish three aims:
 Conduct further research developments to: 1) extend the new approach (quantile regression forest with
 kriged data layer) developed in Phase I to include additional ML algorithms (i.e., support vector machines,
 gradient boosting) and spatial data layers (e.g., eigenvectors of distance matrix) in the comparison study,
 and 2) generalize cross-validation and performance measures to the multivariate case.
 Complete a fully functional and tested soft indicator coding and ML geostatistical interpolation software
 product ready for commercial distribution.
 Conduct a formal usability study to evaluate the design of the prototype based on usability protocols
 developed by the NIH involving (i) expert evaluation by the firm Tec-Ed and (ii) usability testing by
 representative users.
These technologic, scientific and commercial innovations will enhance our ability to model geostatistically
multivariate spatial phenomena and compute estimates and the associated uncertainty at the scale (e.g. point
location, census-tract level) the most relevant for environmental epidemiology."
11007139,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mental illness among college students has become a public health crisis. Even before the pandemic, many
college campuses lacked the resources to support students’ mental health needs. The rise in demand
particularly impacts the over 335,000 students at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).
Research has consistently demonstrated that there are racial inequities in mental health with Black Americans
experiencing worse depressive symptoms and psychological distress compared with White Americans. College
campus counseling centers have begun to think creatively about how to meet the growing demand for services
as the number of available therapists is insufficient to treat the number of students seeking help. TheraGroup is
the solution to leverage innovative group technology to provide Guided Group Therapy (GGT) in which
students receive evidenced-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) coping skills training to address the
high demand for mental health services and bridge the gap in services for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)
populations on an HBCU college campuses. TheraGroup is the first large scale virtual group real-time platform
for evidenced-based mental health therapy. TheraGroup is a HIPAA-compliant, platform-agnostic tool that
provides the channel through which GGT will be facilitated to service the Black college students to improve
student mental health outcomes. In Aim 1, we will develop the TheraGroup platform. We will achieve this by
optimizing our existing platform, which is therapy enabled for one-to-one therapy, to enable one-to-many
communication in a large group context. In addition, we will develop other proprietary features that create an
anonymous and interactive group discussion experience. The proof of concept will be demonstrated with high
usage across multiple devices. In Aim 2 we will implement a feasibility study to assess the impact of GGT via
TheraGroup on measures of engagement, user experience, and mental health outcomes in Black college
students. If participants’ outcome measures in the GGT group are in line with participants’ outcome measures
in the IT group, the feasibility study will serve as a precursor to testing the effects of GGT via TheraGroup
using a larger scale randomized control trial. Achieving these aims gives proof of concept that TheraGroup can
remediate systemic inequalities in mental healthcare that disproportionately impact black college students.
These insights could offer a new actionable tool to supplement existing mental health interventions to address
the ever-growing need for mental health services among Black college students."
11006577,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
HIV infection rates in the U.S. military have doubled since 2003, yet no interventions targeting HIV
transmission in this population have been tested in over 15 years. Eighty percent of new infections occur
among active-duty men who have sex with men (AD-MSM) – a population that is critically understudied due to
a long history of policies that prevented researchers from asking service members about sexual identity or
same-sex behavior. Permitted since 2012, research on behavioral health among AD-MSM remains scarce.
Initial evidence suggests that HIV prevention for AD-MSM should target alcohol-related sexual risk behavior
(AR-SRB). The causal link between alcohol use and risky sex is well established. Heavy drinking is prevalent
among service members, highest among AD-MSM, and driven by highly pro-drinking military social norms.
Alcohol misuse and risky sex are also both link to traumatic stress, particularly sexual assault, and AD-MSM
have over 5 times greater odds of military sexual trauma (MST) relative to their straight male peers. Pre-
exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a common target of current civilian HIV prevention efforts, is less viable for AD-
MSM due to significant social and structural barriers unique to the military – persistent stigma, absence of
medical confidentiality, unavailability of PrEP at many installations, and prohibitions against its use by service
members on deployment, shipboard, or in certain occupational specialties. Internet-based personalized
feedback interventions (iPFI) are an ideal modality to address AR-SRB among AD-MSM. Delivered privately,
iPFI has shown efficacy for reducing heavy drinking and related problems. The present 2-phase study seeks to
develop a trauma-informed iPFI targeting both heavy drinking and sexual risk behavior among AD-MSM.
Phase 1a: A survey of 160 AD-MSM will establish behavioral norms and provide data to test a novel behavioral
framework describing traumatic stress and military culture as pathways to AR-SRB. Phase 1b: Qualitative
interviews of 15 AD-MSM will contextualize AR-SRB and gather feedback on draft iPFI components. Phase 1c:
We will finalize a novel iPFI based on findings and extant iPFI models. Phase 2: A randomized controlled trial
(N=50) will provide data on intervention feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy. Pilot data will be
used for an R01 application to NIAAA seeking to test the further-refined iPFI in a fully powered RCT. The
training plan for this application will focus on growing expertise in intervention development, AR-SRB,
behavioral responses to traumatic stress, AD-MSM health, and methodologies for research on stigmatized
behaviors and hard-to-reach populations. A highly productive team of mentors is committed to Dr. Walton’s
success and will each contribute unique expertise to his research and training plans. Support from this award
is crucial to Dr. Walton’s development as an independent scientist, in the vanguard of scholarship on AD-MSM,
who can conduct meaningful research on the prevention of both alcohol misuse and HIV."
11006900,"Systemic sclerosis or scleroderma is an autoimmune rheumatic disease characterized by fibrosis
of the skin and internal organs that has the highest case fatality among rheumatic diseases. The
increased deposition of collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins in the tissues leads to
impaired function of visceral organs and early death. Although several drugs such as recently
approved nintedanib and tocilizumab may stabilize lung function in some scleroderma patients,
none of those have a significant effect on skin fibrosis as measured by the modified Rodnan skin
score, underscoring the need to develop new therapies for this potentially lethal disease.
Small peptides are widely involved in multiple cellular events and play very important roles in
various cell functions. Interest in peptides as potential drug candidates remains high. With
advances in such fields as chemical synthesis and peptide formulation, peptide drugs - especially
short synthetic and long-acting peptides - are quickly increasing in the global market. The
advantages of small peptides as drugs include their high biological activity, high specificity, and
low toxicity.
FibroBiologics, LLC proposes to develop the novel peptide M10 as an efficacious antifibrotic
therapeutic agent, with a lead indication for the treatment of patients who suffer from skin fibrosis
associated with scleroderma. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine antifibrotic activity of M10 in
primary skin fibroblasts isolated from scleroderma patients and evaluate an inhibitory effect of
M10 on fibrogenic characteristics of scleroderma skin fibroblasts. In Specific Aim 2, we will define
the efficacious dosing of M10 in two different animal models of dermal fibrosis: bleomycin-induced
mouse model and FSP-driven TβR1CA mouse model. The successful completion of these two
specific aims will provide important information about the feasibility of developing M10 as a novel
therapeutic for skin fibrosis and will justify further studies focusing on gaining FDA clearance,
scaling production, and a human clinical trial."

Cardiovascular disease, primarily driven by atherosclerosis, is the leading cause of death in the U.S. The recent
FDA Modernization Act 2.0 allows the use of alternatives to animal models in drug testing, spurring the
development of advanced in vitro models like cell-based assays and artificial intelligence-based systems to
streamline drug development processes. However, current atherosclerosis assays, mostly based on simple 2D cell
cultures, don't adequately replicate the disease's complexity, potentially leading to inaccurate results.
To address this issue, Endomimetics has developed innovative nanomatrix cell sheet technology and “cell-as-
glue” approach as well as formulated novel atherosclerotic inducing mediums, which can produce an in vitro 3D
nanomatrix vascular sheet (VS) and a novel 3D in vitro atherosclerosis model - nanomatrix vascular sheet with
atherosclerosis (VSA).
Therefore, our aim is to revolutionize the field by developing an automated, highly precise approach for fabricating
VS and VSA. This advancement will enable the use of VS and VSA in creating functional assays for efficient, high-
throughput drug testing in a 3D human atherosclerosis environment and allow for the evaluation of both the efficacy
and cytotoxicity of drugs across extensive sample sizes, while minimizing biological variability. Such an initiative,
unprecedented in its scope and precision, has not yet been achieved in any existing in vitro atherosclerosis assays.
Specifically, we will develop two innovative assays integrating BODIPY staining and ELISA methods, aimed at
determining the efficacy of atherosclerosis treatments by their capacity to suppress foam cell formation and curtail
inflammatory cytokine production.
Established anti-atherosclerosis and anti-inflammatory compounds will serve as positive controls, validating the
accuracy of the assays in detecting reductions in both foam cell formation and cytokine secretion. Simultaneously,
negative controls will be employed to evaluate assay specificity, ensuring the precision of our results, and
eliminating the potential for false positives.
To demonstrate the feasibility of our assays in evaluating new atherosclerosis therapeutics, we will assess the
efficacy of two histone deacetylases inhibitors at various doses using our assays. Additionally, we will develop
and execute cytotoxicity-based assays to investigate the safety of these inhibitors."
10975976,"Abstract
Desmosomes are cell adhesion structures that provide mechanical stability to the epidermis and
other tissues. Their canonical function is to link cells to the underlying intermediate filament
network, and disruption of these linkages can lead to diverse pathologies including skin blistering
and cardiomyopathies/dysplasias. For example, in autoimmune diseases collectively known as
pemphigus, pathogenic antibodies targeting the desmosomes result in life-threatening blistering
and loss of barrier function. We have identified a novel role for desmosomes in organizing the
localization of mRNAs in the cell, as well as the localization of translational machinery and
regulators. Further, perturbing desmosomes through wounding or through treatment with
pathogenic pemphigus antibody disrupts the desmosome-dependent localization of translational
regulators to the cell cortex. Based on these data, we propose that desmosomes are major
regulators of mRNA and translational pathways. Additionally, we hypothesize that desmosomes
are sensors of tissue integrity that alter translation in response to defective adhesion. Here we will
determine the molecular mechanisms underlying cortical recruitment of mRNAs and translational
regulators. Further, to define the functional relevance of translational control by desmosomes, we
will determine the acute translational response upon desmosome disruption during both wounding
and pemphigus. In addition, we will use single molecule live-imaging approaches to determine the
sites of protein translation under both homeostatic conditions and when desmosomes are
disrupted. This work will define novel mechanisms for cell adhesions in regulating post-
transcriptional gene expression, which may have essential functions in sensing and responding to
defects in epithelial integrity."

Syphilis is a sexually and vertically transmitted disease caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum
(TPA). While adult syphilis is often asymptomatic and self-resolving, congenital syphilis – fetal infection during
pregnancy – can cause birth defects and neonatal death. Since 2017, syphilis has climbed 170% in reproductive
age women and 203% among newborns. Syphilis is treatable with penicillin, but timely maternal and newborn
diagnosis remains a complex social and scientific problem. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can detect TPA in
newborns and in adult chancres from initial (primary syphilis) and sores from subsequent flu-like (secondary
syphilis) stages. But poverty, abusive relations, and information gap often prevent women from seeking timely
care while high cost, long turnaround time and lack of knowledge diminishes clinical uptake. Pregnant patients
often present in asymptomatic latent (late) syphilis stage when PCR has low sensitivity in peripheral blood, saliva,
and urine. Meanwhile, studies have not looked at specimens, such as vaginal fluids, interfacing the uterine
environment, which we hypothesize, are more likely to contain elevated TPA and correlated microbiome
biomarkers for development of novel maternal diagnostics. Immunoassays also have poor sensitivity and
specificity and require physical exam and treatment data. New molecular tests that make diagnosis easier, faster,
more reliable, and accessible are urgently needed to fight the syphilis epidemic and prevent congenital infections.
Our goal is to address this need using a triad approach where in Aim 1 we will develop a point-of-care nucleic
acid test (POC NAT) and automate it on microfluidic rapid and autonomous analytical devices (microRAAD) with
colorimetric readout. Without complex instruments, this POC NAT will allow rapid detection of congenital syphilis
in neonatal peripheral blood and would be reconfigurable for adult swab self-testing. By using engineered DNA
polymerases for amplification of multiple genes (sensitive) with sequence decoding strand exchange probes that
will logically calculate an integrated colorimetric signal (specific) on a lateral flow dipstick (practical), our test
should be more sensitive, more specific, faster, and more easily adapted to POC use than anything currently
available. To ensure wide reach and uptake of this diagnostic, we will perform early end user assessment of
feasibility, acceptability, usability, and implementation preferences (Aim 3). Finally, to enable new maternal
syphilis diagnostics, we will evaluate TPA detectability and microbiome perturbation in maternal vaginal self-
swabs (Aim 2). Our Aims are highly achievable because we have a history of collaboration, in-depth expertise,
validated assay and device technologies, and public health nexus with sexual healthcare. The resulting data
would facilitate future clinical validation and translation into practice via Early Translational Research Awards
and industry partnerships for manufacturing. Taken together, by making syphilis diagnosis easier, more accurate,
and accessible, this research will make a significant impact on congenital syphilis prevention. Moreover, this
robust approach to fast and accurate pathogen detection can be readily diversified to a wider array of pathogens."

The objective of the project is to develop the world-first X-ray dual-energy cone-beam microCT (DECB µCT)
dedicated to intraoperative imaging of lumpectomy specimen for improving positive margin identification (PMI)
and thus re-call rate for re-surgery in breast conserving surgery (BCS). Breast cancer remains the leading
cancer among women in the US, BCS is used as part of the BC treatment for majority of the cases. In BCS,
the specimen of negative margin containing tumor is excised with a minimum rim of normal fibroglandular (FG)
and adipose tissues, as opposed to removal of the entire breast in mastectomy. Positive margins (PM), i.e.,
breast cancer (BC) close to, or on, the specimen edge, if missed, can lead to a high re-surgery rate. While the
BC-adipose tissue contrast can be high, the BC-FG tissue contrast remains low in standard X-ray imaging.
Therefore, it is critically important to develop intraoperative imaging techniques to differentiate BC and FG
tissues during the BCS. Our DECB µCT, enabled with innovative algorithms for image reconstruction and
analysis, can yield 3D volumetric specimen images with enhanced BC-FG contrast that can directly improve
intraoperative PMI and minimize missed PMs. It thus addresses the need to reduce the BCS recall and re-
surgery rates. The specific aims of the project are (1) To develop DECB µCT for quantitative lumpectomy
specimen imaging; (2a) To acquire highly-sampled DECB µCT of invasive ductal/lobular carcinomas
specimens; (2b) To optimize and adapt scan designs of the DECB µCT to BCS clinical workflow; and (3) To
evaluate the DECB µCT using patient specimens and to compile a tumor database. The project is built upon
our previous success in the development and clinical application of single-energy cone-beam (SECB) µCT,
and a key outcome of the project is that we will have established the feasibility of DECB μCT for yielding
enhanced BC-FG tissue contrast for improving intraoperative-PMI with AUC of ∼0.95 or higher, thus leading to
a reduction of the current BCS re-surgery rate. The first database of quantitative images and their
histopathological analysis data of breast malignant tissues will also be created that provides unprecedented
amount of detailed information about breast normal and tumor tissues valuable to the development of machine
learning (ML)-/deep learning (DL)-based methods for automated intraoperative-PMI in BCS and to the
fundamental understanding of BC characteristics for advancing breast cancer research and applications."

The purpose of this K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award application is to support the
applicant’s long-term goal to develop an independent research program focused on improving the health and
quality of life for adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) through healthy lifestyle behaviors, with a particular
focus on underrepresented minority populations. Black adults are disproportionately affected by CKD and have
some of the worst health outcomes among those with CKD. Adults with CKD are extremely sedentary, and the
poor health outcomes associated with CKD may be modifiable by addressing sedentary behavior- a lifestyle
behavior associated with adverse health consequences. Theory-based behavioral interventions can effectively
reduce sedentary time, but research is lacking on theory-based sedentary reducing interventions adapted to
meet the unique needs of the at-risk population of Black adults with CKD. The overall goal of this award is to
adapt an evidenced-based intervention to reduce sedentary time for Black adults with CKD guided by patient-
centered design. During Aim 1, an evidenced-based sedentary reducing intervention will be adapted to
address unique factors that influence sedentary behavior for Black adults with CKD. Adaptation of the
intervention will be led by a Patient Advisory Board comprised of Black adults with CKD. In Aim 2, we will
conduct a 12-week pilot randomized controlled trial of the adapted intervention (RESET-CKD) to reduce
sedentary time for Black adults with CKD. In Aim 3, we will explore the lived experience of the RESET-CKD
intervention participants and identify barriers and facilitators to reducing sedentary time. These findings will be
used to inform the development of the efficacy trial that will follow this K23 award. This proposal aligns with the
National Institute of Nursing Research’s (NINR) mission to promote health equity by addressing the health
outcome inequities experienced by Black adults with CKD by adapting a sedentary reducing intervention to
meet the needs of Black adults with CKD. Under the guidance of the multidisciplinary mentoring team, the
applicant will receive training in health disparities and health equity research, clinical trial design, and mixed
methods to conduct this innovative work and expand the applicant’s program of research. Completion of this
proposal will generate data to support an R01 application to conduct a large, randomized controlled
intervention to decrease sedentary time and improve outcomes in Black adults with CKD. This K23 Award will
support the candidate’s career development as a nurse scientist by conducting mentored research focused on
decreasing sedentary behavior for Black adults with CKD in the context of the NINR Health Equity Research
Lens."

ABSTRACT
The goal of this application is to identify novel mechanisms by which antiretroviral antibody responses are
generated. Retroviruses are highly successful pathogens, able to subvert or evade immune responses in most
infected individuals. In some unique cases, the detection of viral infection by the innate immune system results
in the induction of an adaptive immune response able to control viral infection and prevent the development of
disease. This ability to control retroviral replication is most often driven by the specific genetic make-up of the
host. However, investigation of the genetic and immunologic basis for these responses in humans is extremely
difficult; therefore, animal models of retroviral infection are required for the dissection of the requirements for
protective immune responses. To this end, murine models of retroviral infection have provided essential insights
into understanding the molecular mechanisms of anti-retroviral immune responses. Inbred strains capable of
mounting neutralizing antibody responses provide the opportunity to dissect the signaling pathways underlying
these responses. The canonical pathway for antiviral antibody production in mice involves stimulation of antigen-
specific B cells by the cytokine interferon-γ (IFNγ), resulting in production of virus specific antibodies of the IgG2a
isotype. This is the predominant pathway for the generation of neutralizing responses to a variety of viral
infections, including retroviral infections. We recently identified that some inbred mice inherit an alternative, IFNγ-
independent pathway to produce retrovirus-neutralizing IgG2a antibodies. The mechanism of resistance is
recessive and controlled by a single locus in which we have identified a candidate gene. The studies proposed
in this application will elucidate the genetic mechanisms underlying this unique pathway The knowledge gained
by this investigation will uncover the basis for a previously unappreciated pathway for antibody production in
response to viral infection. Such insight could greatly aid the development of new animal models of human
disease and novel therapeutic intervention."
10984781,"Pneumonia results from uncontrolled lung inflammation and injury often triggered by viral/bacterial pathogen
insults. Pneumococci, instigating agents of bacterial pneumonia, are independently pathogenic causing lower
respiratory tract infections and hospitalizations in adults, including those with chronic pulmonary conditions like
asthma. Pneumococci are also opportunistic pathogens particularly synergizing with respiratory viruses, like
influenza A virus (IAV), to cause severe morbidity and excess mortality. Our prior work established that IAV
infection during heightened eosinophilic allergic inflammation was host protective, recapitulating clinical data
from the 2009 Swine Flu pandemic. Using a laboratory model we developed to investigate mechanisms by which
this protection occurred, we identified novel functions for eosinophils as direct mediators of antiviral immunity
during early and late phases of IAV infection. Importantly, eosinophilic asthma was also host protective during
co-infection with IAV and Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn), an outcome that was lost in eosinophil deficient
mice. Further preliminary data show that eosinophils, a) internalize Spn in large numbers, b) kill intracellular and
extracellular Spn, c) undergo physiologic and phenotypic alterations in response to Spn uptake. These data led
to our central hypothesis that eosinophils in allergic airways promote anti-bacterial immunity against Spn through
direct and indirect mechanisms to reduce the bacterial load and safeguard the host. The two overlapping aims
to be investigated in this project are: (1) To determine mechanisms and outcomes of interactions between
eosinophils and Spn, and (2) To elucidate pathways by which eosinophil-Spn interactions impact surrounding
leukocytes important in mucosal host defense during co-infection. This project is significant because we propose
to identify basic immune mechanisms in pulmonary host defense against a prominent human pathogen with an
innovative approach of investigating eosinophils as a regulator of local innate immunity and mediator of host
protection rather than as an end-stage effector cell. These studies will have a broad impact on eosinophil biology,
on our appreciation of host-pathogen interactions in allergic asthma and may offer novel therapeutic targets to
treat bacterial co-infections during influenza in allergic hosts."

10984838,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Dr. Singh’s long-term goal is to lead research efforts that enhance
delivery of palliative care to improve person-centered outcomes for hospitalized older adults with advanced
cancer discharged to skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and their family caregivers. The current model of SNF
care is inadequate to meet the unique needs of these patients who often experience rapid clinical decline due
to the juxtaposition of comorbidities and geriatric syndromes which places them at risk for receiving goal-
discordant care. Palliative care nursing home interventions have been challenging to implement and have
targeted long-stay residents who have different needs than SNF patients. Dr. Singh is a physician in the
Division of Hospital Medicine at the University of Colorado. Her proposal tests the ALIGN (Assessing and
Listening to Individual Goals and Needs) intervention which utilizes palliative care social workers to deliver a
guideline-based manualized intervention for older patients with cancer discharged to SNFs and their family
caregivers. In a preliminary study funded by the National Palliative Care Research Center, Dr. Singh
demonstrated that virtual ALIGN visits could be conducted in community SNFs and that the intervention was
highly acceptable. Patients experienced high morbidity and mortality leading many to change their goals to
comfort focused care and necessitating increased family caregiver involvement in surrogate decision making.
This K23 proposal aims to address key gaps and strengthen ALIGN for future clinical efficacy testing. The
objectives are to: 1) conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to test feasibility of enrolling participants into a
randomized design, outcome collection, preliminary efficacy, and risk for contamination; 2) evaluate
implementation outcomes, including intervention fidelity, of ALIGN in community SNFs; 3) determine processes
through which ALIGN prepares caregivers for surrogate decision making to iteratively refine the intervention to
improve goal concordant care. The proposed training plan is designed to accelerate Dr. Singh’s development
into an independent patient-oriented researcher and includes training in clinical trial design and analysis,
implementation science, caregiver focused palliative care interventions, and preparation for independence. Dr.
Singh has assembled an exceptional mentorship team, led by Dr. Stacy Fischer, with complementary expertise
in clinical trials in an oncology population, palliative care social work, nursing home research, implementation
science, surrogate and end of life decision making, and caregiving research. The K23 award would enable Dr.
Singh to continue developing her research skills while providing her with data to prepare an R01 proposal for a
fully powered clinical trial of ALIGN evaluating efficacy. Successful completion of this research will inform the
development of a scalable model of palliative care that can be implemented in community SNFs to maximize
real-world effectiveness. Further, it will expand our understanding of how to best prepare family caregivers for
surrogate decision making to improve delivery of care aligned with patient preferences after discharge to SNF."

Down syndrome (DS) is considered a genetic form of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Most adults with DS have AD
pathology by age 40 and progress to dementia by 60 years old. Studying AD in adults with DS is critical for two
reasons. First, individuals with DS are living longer and most will experience dementia in their lifetimes, so AD
represents an emerging public health crisis in this population. Second, as the pathophysiological progression of
AD in adults with DS is considered similar to AD in the neurotypical population, the study of AD in DS has great
potential to provide insight into pathogenesis, course, and prevention or treatment strategies for the neurotypical
population as well. Despite a primary focus on the precipitating role of beta amyloid in AD, there is increasing
evidence that cerebrovascular disease and neuroinflammation play a critical role in AD pathogenesis and
progression. The proposed study will use a cross-disciplinary approach to understand: 1) the independent and
interactive consequences of cerebrovascular lesions and neuroinflammation on AD pathology and downstream
cognitive decline, 2) the relationship between cerebrovascular disease, blood-brain barrier disruption, and
neuroinflammation with AD pathology, and 3) the postmortem relationships among small vessel cerebrovascular
disease, neuroinflammation, and tau pathology. These aims will be examined in the Alzheimer’s Disease
Biomarker Consortium – Down Syndrome, the largest longitudinal cohort study of aging in adults with DS, by
examining the independent and synergistic impact of cerebrovascular and inflammatory markers on the
pathophysiology and progression of AD in adults with DS.
This fellowship will prepare the applicant, Natalie Edwards, for an independent, translational research career,
centered on the contributions of cerebrovascular disease (CVD), neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier (BBB)
disruption, and their interactions on the pathophysiology and progression of AD in adults with DS. The
comprehensive training plan focuses on an advanced methodological and biological understanding of the role of
CVD and neuroinflammation in DS-AD through formal coursework, hands-on experience, mentorship, and
professional development. Natalie will be supported by a mentorship team with a long history of collaboration,
commitment to training, and expertise in AD and DS, including Adam Brickman at Columbia University, Elizabeth
Head at University of California, Irvine, and Donna Wilcock at Indiana University. The mentorship team will
provide topical training in AD, DS, neurobiology and neuropsychology of neurodegenerative diseases, vascular
biology, and applied training in neuroimaging, biofluidic biomarkers, and neuropathology and strategies for
career development. The training plan will help Natalie develop an in-depth knowledge in: 1) advanced
neuroimaging techniques, 2) biofluidic biomarkers of AD and neuroinflammation, 3) fundamental
neuropathological techniques and analytic strategies, and 4) developing a novel line of translational research.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive primary brain tumor with a median survival of approximately 15
months. Currently, the standard of care therapy includes resection followed by chemotherapy and/or
radiotherapy. These treatments are limited by incomplete tumor resection and poor therapeutic delivery due to
the blood-tumor and blood-brain barriers. Gene therapy has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy for the
treatment of GBM. In fact, clinical trials have explored the delivery of oncolytic viruses, suicide genes, and the
p53 gene, however these therapies are also largely challenged by poor delivery. Nanoparticles (NPs) are
typically employed with gene therapies to protect nucleic acids from degradation and improve tissue
accumulation and penetration. However, NP gene delivery platforms often rely on passive accumulation in the
tumor facilitated by leaky vasculature (i.e., enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect) which is intra- and
intertumorally heterogeneous and only allows for a small fraction of the NPs to accumulate in the tumor. These
proposed studies aim to improve tumoral therapeutic accumulation by developing novel non-viral gene delivery
platforms for GBM. Brain penetrating NPs (BPNs) are a class of densely PEGylated polyethyleneimine (PEI)
NPs that have demonstrated enhanced tumor targeting as compared to conventionally PEGylated PEI NPs. In
our studies, we have modified BPNs (SH-BPNs) to target exofacial thiols overexpressed by tumor cells due to
the dysregulated protein synthesis in the tumor microenvironment. First, we will investigate the tumor-tropism
and transfection characteristics of SH-BPNs compared to BPNs via two different administration routes:
intratumoral injection and systemic delivery. Next, we will further optimize gene delivery by using focused
ultrasound (FUS) treatment regimens to enhance therapeutic delivery. To address the challenges of the EPR
effect, researchers have employed FUS to enhance the delivery of various therapeutic agents, including NPs,
across various biological barriers. We will investigate SH-BPN delivery at various time points relative to FUS
treatments. While most FUS-mediated delivery of NPs involves the intravenous administration of microbubbles
(MBs) followed by NPs, studies have shown that the coupling of the two to create a NP-MB construct improves
transfection efficacy. We will also explore the effects of SH-BPN conjugation to MBs (SH-BPN-MBs). Overall,
this study contributes to the development of targeted gene therapy strategies for GBM by addressing delivery
challenges and enhancing the therapeutic potential of nucleic acid-based treatments."

Therapeutic Resolution, organized by Drs. Valerie Horsley, Michael Longaker and Thomas Wynn. The
conference will be held in Whistler, BC, Canada from December 8-12, 2024.
Fibrosis is characterized by aberrant fibroblast activation and inadequate tissue repair. Fibrosis is a common
end-stage pathology in all major internal organs and solid tumors causing 45% of deaths in Europe and North
America. While advances have been made in the understanding of molecular mechanisms driving tissue injury
and fibrosis, there remains a need to identify targets/pathways that are relevant to human disease and can be
leveraged to promote repair and regeneration, as well as to develop translational strategies to facilitate clinical
development of novel therapies. This long-standing symposium series will serve as an engaging platform for
world-renowned researchers across the globe, both early-career and established, to exchange ideas, showcase
pioneering findings, and foster fruitful collaborations on topics of clinical innovations, immunobiology, and
mechanobiology in the field of fibrosis research. The program will include workshops on multiomics approaches
and lessons learned across tissues, as well as poster sessions, and informal activities to facilitate community
building and in-depth discussions. Additionally, the conference will provide unparalleled opportunities for
mentoring, training, and interactive scientific exchanges. With its wide-ranging scope of topics and unique

The International Lowe Syndrome Symposium, scheduled for November 2024 at Purdue University, aims to
transform the landscape of Lowe Syndrome (LS) research and care. This rare genetic disorder, marked by early
mortality and a lack of effective treatments, demands urgent attention and collaborative efforts. The symposium
will unite an international assembly of scientists, clinicians, patients, and families, fostering an inclusive and
multidisciplinary approach to understanding and treating LS.
Our primary goals are to advance scientific research, enhance clinical practices, promote diversity and inclusivity
in medical research, and empower junior investigators in the field of LS. A focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion
ensures broad representation and accessibility, enhancing the symposium's impact across various communities.
The Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (Indiana CTSI) infrastructure will be used as a vehicle
to engage a regional and national network, in order to attract a broad range of participants to the symposium.
A central initiative is the ""Bring a Junior Colleague"" program, supported by R13 funding, which is designed to
engage and develop emerging scientists and clinicians. This includes a “Poster Competition” to encourage
innovative research and provide young investigators with a platform for visibility and professional growth. The
2-day meeting agenda also includes current updates from key investigators, clinicians and patient families
through talks and panel discussions.
The symposium's outcomes are expected to be far-reaching: sharing cutting-edge research, establishing strong
networks for ongoing collaboration, raising public awareness, and identifying new translational opportunities.
Ultimately, the symposium seeks to improve clinical outcomes and enhance the quality of life for those affected
by Lowe Syndrome. In summary, the International Lowe Syndrome Symposium stands as a crucial convergence
point for accelerating progress in LS research and treatment, advocating for patients and families, and cultivating
the next generation of dedicated researchers."

area. Having a database to search for specific characteristics or knowledge, and a platform to identify and
introduce potential partners in is expected to lead to longer associations and startup success. SUD companies
may require some different skill sets, e.g., public health’s focus on the social determinants of health, or public
finance and non-profit management, and thus finding a way to match academic researchers with entrepreneurial
leaders interested in startups that tackle drug addiction is key to establishing successful ventures.
We will also generate and track possible measures of success including networking metrics and publish findings
on these associated metrics. Again, with specific reference to SUD ventures, we will hypothesize metrics that

The ability to sense osmolarity changes and maintain fluid osmolarity is required for normal physiological
functions of every single cell and thus vital for human health. Fluid imbalance, caused by high osmolarity
(hyperosmolarity) or low osmolarity (hypoosmolarity), can lead to irreversible damage to organs and cause
lethal neurological trauma. In humans, the osmolarity of body fluids is continuously monitored in the brain and
kept within a very narrow range (275-299 mOsm/kg). As little as a one percent increase in blood osmolarity is
enough to trigger thirst. A key element for such robust osmoregulation is the molecular osmosensors that
detect osmolarity changes. However, the molecular identities of osmosensors in the animal kingdom have
remained elusive. The difficulty in identifying osmosensors in animals is partly due to the lack of an unbiased
screening system. Previous efforts to identify osmosensors in animals were restricted to TRP channels.
However, osmosensors do not necessarily fall into the TRP channel family and thus may have eluded
detection. The nematode C. elegans is an ideal model to study osmosensing. Like mammals, C. elegans has
osmosensing systems, and conserved signaling molecules have been identified. This, together with its short
generation time (~3 days) and facile and rich genetic tools, makes C. elegans an ideal system for identifying
novel osmosensors. To identify osmosensors in C. elegans, we designed and conducted a neural activity-
based genetic screen. We have identified OSMS-1 and OSMS-2 as candidate osmosensors in C. elegans.
Despite this exciting finding, many questions remain unanswered. In the current proposal, we propose to test
the hypothesis that OSMS-1 and OSMS-2 are bona fide osmosensors and characterize the molecular
mechanisms by which OSMS-1 and OSMS-2 sense osmolarity. We will take a multidisciplinary approach by
integrating molecular genetics, behavioral analysis, calcium imaging, electrophysiology, and cryo-EM. To do
so, I will receive extensive training on calcium imaging, cell culture, electrophysiological recording, and cryo-
EM. The K99/R00 award will allow me to acquire these skills with guidance from my mentors Drs. Shawn Xu
and Melanie Ohi, which will help me to launch an independent research career. The proposed work will lead to
the identification of the first osmosensors in the animal kingdom, gain a molecular understanding of how
osmosensors sense osmotic stimuli, and provide novel insights into osmosensation, osmoregulation and
related human diseases."

early task of the stakeholder engagement core is to compile a list of stakeholder organizations that span the
breadth of societal interactions and care for people living with ADRD. The list will include advocacy groups, state
and federal government agencies, provider groups, and representatives from numerous industries:
pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, private equity/venture capital, foundations and venture philanthropy, insurance,
healthcare, long-term care, accountable care, and geriatrics, to name a few. A related early task is to lay out a
stakeholder engagement plan that delineates a process for reaching out to stakeholders, gathering input on

consortium website for stakeholder communication and resource sharing, and a monitoring and oversight plan
for assessing stakeholder engagement activities and accomplishments. We will convene formal stakeholder
meetings twice annually. We anticipate organizing these meetings with targeted groups that best represent on
the ground experience in one of the thematic priorities at a time – rather than complicating these meetings with
multiple categories of stakeholder groups. One meeting might focus on understanding new drug development,
another on formal and informal caregiving, another on health disparities, for example. Early meetings would be
largely to learn from stakeholders, and to improve the research plans, based on the on the ground experience
of the stakeholders. Later meetings would focus more on the translational opportunities inherent in the research

While several innovative and creative immuno-oncology (IO) strategies have shown promising results, a
significant expansion of their clinical use will require collaborative efforts to elucidate the resistance mechanism,
discover new immune targets, identify predictive biomarkers, evaluate combination therapies, and develop
preventive approaches. Utilizing a multi-disciplinary team approach, we will support Immuno-Oncology
Translation Network (IOTN)-funded components to discover new immune targets and evaluate novel immune-
based therapies and combination approaches that eliminate established cancers in adults or to prevent
cancers before they occur. Our DMRC strategy is to serve as an administrative and analytic hub at every step
of the IOTN’s translational studies, focusing to reduce the barrier for access to analytic expertise, improve the
productivity of IOTN investigators, maintain a high standard for data collection and management, design and
perform rigorous analytical strategies, and foster a collaborative and supportive research community.
An experienced, multidisciplinary team has been assembled to pursue four specific aims: First, we will provide
a centralized administration infrastructure to coordinate IOTN activities, building upon the NRG Oncology
Statistical and Data Coordinating Center’s experience of coordinating over 450 translational cancer studies
across hundreds of participating sites. Second, we will provide multidisciplinary analytic expertise to support
IOTN collaborative research, leveraging five of RPCI CCSG’s shared resources: Biostatistics, Bioinformatics,
Biomedical Data Science, Data Bank and BioRepository, and Immune Analysis. Our analytic support will be
armed with professional IT staff and informed by an experienced IO researcher team. Third, we will develop
innovative data integration methods to enhance IOTN research capacity, capitalizing on the well-respected
Bioconductor project and the independent research programs of the RPCI department of Biostatistics and
Bioinformatics. Fourth, we will actively promote the IOTN and engage in trans-consortium interactions, where
we will leverage Bioconductor’s decade-long experience in community engagement and the NRG data center’s
rich expertise in project coordination. Leveraging our active NCI-funded RPCI-committed resource to support
the proposed multi-institutional trans-disciplinary IO research is not only cost-effective, but also flexible in its
study-dependent scalability. Taken together, we envision that our DMRC, in close collaboration with the IOTN,
will allow us to conduct highly effective and innovative translational studies to address the significantly unmet

The goal of this STTR proposal submission is to develop a new extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
(ECMO) pump designed to efficiently accommodate the low flow rates needed for pediatric and neonatal
patients. In smaller pediatric patients including toddlers and neonates we need ECMO pumps that can operate
at lower blood flow rates to avoid the destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis), shear stress, and platelet
activation. For this project, based on the needs of our neonatal intensive care unit and carbon dioxide removal,
we propose to design, develop, and test a low-flow pump that can operate from 0.05 to 0.5 L/min (equivalent to
50 to 500 cc/min) for use in our neonatal patients and patients who require carbon dioxide removal. This flow
rate is an order of magnitude less than current pump designs and should significantly reduce hemolysis and
other centrifugal pump effects.
 Aim 1 – Pump Modelling, Design, and Construction: the pump design will be created to meet the flow rate
specifications of 0.05 to 0.5 L/min. Dr. Wu and his team at the University of Maryland will utilize computational
fluid modeling (CFD) to develop the pump with the optimal geometry parameters, such as impeller size and
volute diameter to provide high efficiency and good biocompatibility (low hemolysis and thrombosis potential).
Milestone: system bench tested for proper operation at low flow rates using distilled water.
 Aim 2 – Evaluate the Device through Comparative Blood Flow Testing: tests will be conducted within the
research laboratories at Children’s National to compare the performance of the new device to the current
standard-of-care pump models. These tests will examine the flow of blood through each pump at different
designated rates and measure the index of hemolysis based on plasma free hemoglobin (PFH) levels.
Milestone: hemolysis reduced by 20% at low flow rates compared to current models."

 Over 100 million adults in the U.S. live with chronic pain. They face risks such as prolonged opioid use,
depression, anxiety, stress, and various social, occupational, and financial problems. Even though opioids
were traditionally used to manage chronic pain, they are no longer the primary option due to their numerous
risks (e.g. overdose, addiction). The CDC and other authorities currently advocate the use of non-opioid
interventions for pain management. Although the shift in policy has successfully decreased opioid
prescriptions, many individuals with pain now encounter a treatment void due to the limited availability of non-
opioid therapies and a shortage of professionals skilled in providing alternative treatments. One promising
solution to these twin dilemmas is the advent of internet-based pain self-management programs. Such
programs have been shown to improve pain-related and mental health outcomes and to reduce prolonged
opioid use. However, some face obstacles in engaging and completing self-directed programs. These
challenges have been shown to diminish when the systematic guidance of trained professionals is available.
 The research team plans to create a Psychologist/Nurse Practitioner-guided version of an existing,
evidence-based online program, the Chronic Pain Management Program (CPMP) to be delivered via
Telehealth. The rigorously tested CPMP has demonstrated significant reductions in opioid use, pain severity,
emotional burden, stress, anxiety, and depression, while concurrently enhancing self-efficacy, coping skills,
and knowledge about chronic pain and its treatment. Despite these successes, the CPMP currently lacks an
option for professional guidance. Consequently, our strategy involves adapting the CPMP's delivery method by
developing a curriculum aimed at training and certifying licensed Clinical/Counseling Psychologists (CPs) and
Nurse Practitioners (NPs) to offer program guidance. This modified format will be integrated into a Telehealth
(virtual) treatment model, broadening the program's availability and accessibility.
The research team will 1) develop Psychologist/Nurse Practitioner Training materials (Aim 1), that align
with the topics and goals of the CPMP and 2) build a web-based Portal (Aim 2) to house the training program,
host profiles of certified CPs/NPs, permit matching of CPs/NPs to adults with chronic pain, provide user access
to the CPMP, and generate automated reports of client program use/progress on the CPMP.
Feasibility will be examined via formative evaluations of the Training materials and the Portal. An iterative
review and product revision process will be carried out by 20 adults with chronic pain and a panel of eight
CPs/NPs. These panels will examine factors such as content, usability, satisfaction, functionality, interest, and
willingness to use. The Goalistics team employed these methods in prior projects to craft a Phase I prototype,
proving its feasibility, technical value, and commercial promise. In Phase II, we aim to formally test the CP/NP
training/certification process and compare the efficacy of the CP/NP-guided CPMP to the self-directed version."
11005643,"The parent P01 asks how HIV vaccines can expand T cells with unique functional capacities, including high
proliferative capacity, cytotoxic function, and memory features. We suggest that only T cells with such features
can provide the host with capacity for control over the virus.
A central objective of our program is to understand the extent to which pre-existing host immune and
metabolic features constrain the quality of T-cell responses to therapeutic vaccination. Which
immunometabolic conditions predict and perhaps foster qualitatively superior responses? What fraction of the
T-cell response to vaccination is represented by new and previously undetected clonotypes, and how do the
functional capacities and differentiation of the new clonotypes differ from pre-existing ones?
A second major objective is to evaluate the relative ability of different vaccine regimens and metabolic
interventions to expand new HIV/SIV-specific T cells with stem-like qualities. We and others have shown
that HIV-specific T cells in natural HIV controllers express high levels of the memory-promoting transcription
factor, TCF-1, retain proliferative capacity, and exhibit metabolic plasticity. We hypothesize that vaccine-
induced cells with stem-like properties often derive from naïve T-cell clonotypes not previously expanded or
chronically exposed to antigen, and that different vaccine regimens differ in their ability to recruit such cells.
A third and central objective of our effort is to learn how peptide specificity, stemness, and metabolic
capacities of T cells responding to vaccination are related to control over viremia during ATI. A large
literature supports our premise that high T-cell quality is required for control over viremia, and more specifically
that T cell memory, or “stemness”, features are associated with effective host responses. However, these
connections remain relatively unexplored in the context of therapeutic vaccination, in part due to scarcity of
large therapeutic-vaccine studies that have yielded an appreciable efficacy signal. We will use samples from
human and non-human primate therapeutic-vaccine studies that have shown evidence for T cell-mediated
virologic suppression to understand if the T-cell features previously linked to control over infection are also
typical of successful immune responses to therapeutic vaccines.
This supplement is requested to allow completing evaluation of a RhCMV/Ad26 strategy that provides samples
for the -omics analysis. The work was initiated using prior funding but additional funds are required for
evaluation of macaques already challenged and for vaccination of additional animals. This experiment uses a
unique Ad26 vector expressing a dominant-negative IL-10 receptor to boost unique immune responses to
RhCMV/SIV vaccines. The hypothesis is that inhibition of IL-10 signaling in APCs will create T cells with
unique functional capacities and simultaneously evade regulatory responses that are particularly strong in
newborns."
10986741,"The Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) proposes a MOSAIC program that will
provide diverse scholars from historically excluded groups in biological and biomedical research with
professional skills needed to establish a successful academic career, coupled with mentoring, cohort support,
network development, and the fostering of resilience. This support will increase scholar retention in academic
research, thus diversifying the biomedical research enterprise and contributing to long-term improvements in
inclusive research environments at institutions and within scientific societies. In turn, this will lead to
advancements in health research outcomes due to the benefit of diverse perspectives brought to the effort to
address scientific challenges. FASEB has deep organizational experience in providing support to early-career
researchers. The project’s goals are to prepare five cohorts of diverse early-career researchers (postdocs
progressing to independent faculty) in research team management and provide support through training,
mentoring, and networking, leading to the MOSAIC scholars’ ability to persist in career advancement while
maintaining well-being through empowerment and resilience. Specific aims are to (1) develop research
management skill sets in diverse postdoctoral and early-career faculty researchers by leveraging FASEB’s deep
network of experts and mentors across scientific societies, as evidenced by scholar capabilities in setting up a
lab and progressing in research; (2) develop resilience in diverse postdoctoral and early-career faculty
researchers through identity development based on competence, performance, and recognition, as evidenced
by increased scholar confidence to overcome barriers and achieve stage-appropriate research career
progression both institutionally and through professional service; and (3) create sustaining support systems that
involve skills development, peer support, and safe spaces, as evidenced by scholar perceptions of the value of
such support in helping them persist in their career pathway while maintaining resilience and well-being.
FASEB’s MOSAIC program will implement a professional development series that covers skill sets important for
facilitating scholar career progression. The series covers foundational skills, professional skills, effective grant
writing, and academic career planning over four years. Resilience will be covered in a resilience and self-
advocacy course and through virtual support spaces. In a multi-mentor model, the scholars will be matched with
a mentor identified through FASEB’s extensive network to complement the mentoring they receive through their
home institutions. Mentoring will cover career issues, professional management, and work-life balance and will
foster the development of professional networks. Additional activities include financial support for conference
attendance; engagement of leaders at the scholars’ home institutions to align efforts; an online cohort support
forum; and opportunities to participate in networking, hone scientific communication skills, prepare for leadership
roles in scientific societies, and interact with FASEB committees."
10983587,"Abstract
 The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) controls the movement of the jaw but is susceptible to acquired
diseases, including osteoarthritis (OA). Osteophytes, referred to as fibrocartilage-capped bony spurs, are one
of the radiographic hallmarks of TMJ degenerative disease and cause skeletal deformities, chronic pain, and
limited condyle movement. Current treatments are limited, and patients may undergo reparative surgical
procedures, which are not always remedial. The etiology and pathogenesis of osteophyte formation in TMJ
OA remain unresolved and interfere with basic, translational, and clinical progress toward new effective
treatments. Recently, arthropathy, including in the TMJ, was reported for the first time in a patient with
compound heterozygous mutations in the PRG4 gene. Our preliminary studies show that Prg4-mutant mice
reproduce some key phenotypes in TMJ OA patients, including synovial hyperplasia and osteophytes.
Whereas heterozygous Prg4-deficient (Prg4+/-) mice did not exhibit a strong TMJ phenotype, osteophytes
did form in homozygous Prg4-null (Prg4-/-) mice, initiating ectopic chondrogenesis. The latter data indicate
that local normal anti-chondrogenic mechanisms had been deranged, possibly causing greater availability of
chondrogenic factors and leading to osteophyte onset. We tested this novel thesis and found that before
osteophyte formation, the expression of the heparan sulfate (HS) synthesizing gene EXT1 was downregulated
in the TMJ fibrocartilage. In addition, we found that the local levels of heparanase (HSPE), the primary
enzyme responsible for extracellular HS degradation, were markedly increased in osteophyte-forming regions
of TMJs. These preliminary data suggest that local decreases in HS and increases in HSPE cause a significant
drop in HS levels and create a robust prochondrogenic-inducing environment. In support of this thesis, BMP
signaling was more greatly distributed within the mutant condyles and developing osteophytes. These and
other data lead to our central hypothesis that a steep local loss of HS triggers osteophyte formation. Aim 1
will test whether conditional Ext1 ablation causes osteophyte formation or worsens the TMJ phenotype in
Prg4+/- mice. We will conduct single-cell RNAseq studies to assess cellular phenotypic characteristics,
developmental trajectories, signaling pathways, and networks during osteophyte formation. Aim 2 will test
whether Bmpr1a ablation will inhibit osteophyte formation in Prg4-null and other mutant mice above. To
expand treatment options and make them clinically relevant, we will test whether administering a BMP
signaling antagonist LDN-193189 prevents or inhibits osteophyte development. This project is based on new
data and insights into the mechanisms of osteophyte formation in the TMJ and will test the efficacy of drug
therapy. Given its novelty, the project is in its early stages but will undoubtedly have major and broadly
relevant implications for basic research and translational medicine for TMJ and other joint-related
musculoskeletal diseases."
10983588,"Suicide among Black preadolescents has increased rapidly over the last two decades, reaching unprecedented
levels. While there have been substantive gains in knowledge related to the etiology of preadolescent suicide
ideation and behaviors (SIB), most of this work has included predominantly White samples or have been cross-
sectional or short-term longitudinal studies. Less is known about the course of SIB during preadolescence, and
malleable individual-specific and social ecological precursors and correlates associated with this course, among
low-income, urban Black youth. Such work is vital to informing developmentally and culturally relevant preventive
interventions aimed at mitigating this major public health problem. The proposed R01 seeks to characterize the
epidemiology and course of SIB among a socioeconomically disadvantaged, urban sample of Black
preadolescents, and to identify factors that confer risk or protection for SIB over time in this understudied
population. To do this, we will build on data collection that occurred as part of a cluster randomized preventive
intervention trial (DA039869) conducted in 48 urban elementary schools with ~5,000 economically
disadvantaged K-2 students of which 2,100 are Black and will be between the ages of 10-12 in the fall of 2024.
The proposed 4-year longitudinal study seeks to accomplish the following aims: characterize the severity and
course of SIB during pre- and early adolescence in a random stratified sub-sample of 1,000 Black youth drawn
from the larger sample of 2,100. Urban, economically disadvantaged Black youth represent a disproportionately
understudied population in preadolescent SIB research (Aim 1); identify risk and protective individual (i.e.,
mental health), proximal and distal environments (e.g., life events, racial discrimination), as well as macro-level
factors (e.g., structural racism) that may be associated with the emergence and progression of SIB (Aim 2); and
determine whether the early elementary school-based universal preventive interventions targeting emotion
regulation and social problem-solving result in reduced engagement in SIB across the preadolescent and early
adolescent years (Aim 3). In addition, in Years 2 and 3 we will draw 2 random stratified sub-samples from the
larger sub-sample of 1,000 to conduct 2 pilot studies encompassing observations of parent-child interactions
(e.g., communication, conflict) and qualitative interviews aimed at better understanding Black youth’s
experiences and coping with racial discrimination. The consideration of multi-level influences and our multi-modal
approach to assessing these influences through the inclusion of quantitative and qualitative assessments will
provide a better understanding of the risk and protective factors that have otherwise been unmeasured and/or
missed in current research. The investigative team brings together expertise in the etiology, epidemiology, and
prevention of SIB among Black preadolescence; child and developmental psychopathology; minority health and
health disparities; and mixed methods; thus, we are extremely well-positioned to accomplish the study aims."
10984251,"Heart failure (HF) disproportionately affects the elderly who predominantly develop HF with preserved left
ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (HFpEF), for which no efficacious therapies exist. Pulmonary hypertension
(PH) – the most clinically recognized expression of pulmonary vascular dysfunction (PVD) – is a risk factor for
incident HF and is present in upto 83% of patients with prevalent HFpEF, among whom it portends worse
outcomes. PVD is therefore an attractive therapeutic target in HFpEF, but its pathophysiology is complex with
variable contributions from elevated left atrial pressure, pulmonary parenchymal injury, and intrinsic
pulmonary vascular dysfunction. A critical barrier to understanding PVD in HFpEF is a lack of knowledge
regarding the anatomic alterations in the pulmonary vasculature underlying abnormal hemodynamics. The
investigative team has pioneered development and validation of advanced image processing pipelines to
quantify pulmonary venous and arterial remodeling on non-contrast chest computerized tomography (CT)
scans. Their published and preliminary data from smokers in the NHLBI-funded COPDGene study show that
pulmonary vascular remodeling associates with RV dysfunction and worse functional capacity, and is more
frequently observed in HF. They now propose to extend these findings to a community-based cohort of older
adults to define the role of pulmonary vascular remodeling in the development of HFpEF. This proposal’s
central hypothesis is that activation of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways promotes pulmonary
vascular remodeling, partially via concomitant LV dysfunction and pulmonary parenchymal injury, leading to
PH, RV dysfunction, and ultimately HF. This project will leverage recently completed chest CT (for CAC) and
echocardiography in 1,579 Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study participants at the 7th study visit
(2/2018-11/2019; age ~81±4 yrs). Novel CT-based measures of pulmonary vascular remodeling and
parenchymal injury (fibrotic, emphysematous), and advanced 3D and strain-based echo measures of RV
function will be performed. These data will be integrated with clinical assessments, outcomes surveillance,
aptamer-based proteomics, and genomics to help define the most relevant targets to prevent progressive PVD
in the very elderly. Specific aims include: (1) Define the extent to which LV dysfunction and pulmonary
parenchymal injury promote pulmonary venous and arterial remodeling in the very elderly; (2) Determine the
extent to which pulmonary vascular remodeling predicts RV dysfunction, reduced functional capacity, and
incident HFpEF; and (3) Identify proteins and protein networks that predict pulmonary vascular remodeling.
Replication will occur in COPDGene and the Framingham Heart Study, and Mendelian randomization analyses
will identify the subset of potentially causal associations. Quantifying pulmonary vascular remodeling will
identify pathophysiologically distinct morphologic PVD sub-phenotypes enabling more precise application of
existing therapies, while discovery of associated molecular pathways may inform novel therapeutic targets."
10984300,"The goal of this renewal K24 proposal is to enhance the ability of Dr. Douglas White to mentor clinician-
scientists focused on developing and testing interventions to mitigate health disparities and promote
goal-concordant care for incapacitated patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF). Patients with ARF
and a poor prognosis often receive intensive, burdensome treatments near the end of life that are
inconsistent with their values and preferences. This is an important public health problem because
providing goal-concordant care is a core element of ethical medical practice. Moreover, it is well
established that there are health disparities in serious illness care; the NIH and NAM have highlighted
that there is a pressing need to determine the extent to which clinicians’ communication patterns
contribute to these health disparities and develop interventions to promote equitable care. Solving this
problem will require the collaboration of scientists with expertise in health disparities, communication
sciences, and health services research. Dr. White is well positioned to lead these efforts. He is a
midcareer investigator with a mature, NIH-funded program of research on surrogate decision making in
ARF. He has a strong record of successful mentoring in patient-oriented research. He has assembled a
team of senior scientists to accomplish the proposed research and mentoring plan. He will increase his
skills as a mentor and expand his scientific expertise by participating in targeted career development
activities in mentoring, academic leadership, and methodology in health disparities research. The
overarching research goal of this renewal K24 proposal is to conduct research examining whether
there are disparities in goals-of-care conversations in patients with ARF and to engage individuals from
marginalized groups in NIH Stage 0 intervention development research to understand their
perspectives on how clinicians can best support them when faced with difficult goals-of-care decisions.
In Aim 1, we will elicit the perspectives of individuals who are Black, Latinx, or have a disability on how
clinicians should support surrogate decision makers of patients with ARF to achieve goal-concordant
care. In Aim 2, we will determine whether racial/ethnic disparities exist in how clinicians counsel
surrogate decision makers in ICUs in a large and diverse dataset of audio recorded clinician-family
conversations (Aim 2a) and conduct exploratory analyses examining associations between
communication patterns in goals-of-care conversations and patient and family outcomes, such as
patient-centeredness of care, psychological distress, trust, and end-of-life health care utilization (Aim
2b). Together, these scientific aims and career development activities will expand Dr. White’s ability to
train the next generation of patient-oriented researchers in developing interventions to promote equity
and goal-concordant care for incapacitated patients with advanced respiratory failure."
10984305,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal presents a three-year research career development program focused on elucidating the molecular
mechanisms and clinical significance of a pathologic macrophage population (Spp1+ macrophages) in peripheral
arterial disease (PAD). The candidate is a currently an Assistant Professor of Surgery in the Division of Vascular
& Endovascular Surgery at Duke University. He has clinical expertise in PAD and research experience in skeletal
muscle biology (CTSA KL2). He has now chosen to focus on the role immune system, particularly macrophages,
play in orchestrating skeletal muscle repair in PAD. Hence, he has sought additional training. The proposed
experiments and didactic work will provide the candidate with a unique skillset that will enable him to transition
to independence as a surgeon-scientist.
Novel therapies for limb loss remain an unmet need. The long-term goal of my research program is to elucidate
the molecular mechanisms of skeletal muscle regeneration in PAD and develop cellular therapies for limb
preservation. Preliminary work in my lab has identified Spp1+ macrophages (Spp1+MΦ) as a pro-inflammatory
macrophage population that is associated with failed muscle regeneration in PAD patients. The overall objectives
of this proposal are to determine the mechanisms and clinical significance of Spp1+MΦ in PAD. The central
hypothesis is that Spp1+MΦ inhibit muscle regeneration by inhibiting muscle stem cell (MuSC) and macrophage
reparative programs. The rationale for this project is that determining the processes that regulate macrophage-
mediated tissue repair and establishing a link between macrophage phenotype and clinical outcomes will provide
a strong foundation for the development of immune-based therapies for PAD. The hypothesis will be tested by
pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine if Spp1+MΦ inhibit MuSC regeneration in the ischemic limb; 2)
Determine if Spp1+MΦ inhibit macrophage polarization to a regenerative phenotype in the ischemic limb; and 3)
Determine if Spp1+MΦ are positively correlated with myopathy, limb loss and mortality in human PAD patients.
In Aims 1 and 2, we will perform hind limb ischemia on mice with conditional overexpression or ablation of Spp1
in myeloid cells. We will assess muscle regeneration and macrophage polarization via histologic,
immunofluorescence (IF), and transcriptional analysis. In Aim 3, we will leverage our large institutional PAD
tissue repository and use spatial transcriptomics and IF analysis to link Spp1+MΦ with dystrophic muscle and
adverse clinical outcomes, such as major amputation and mortality. The research proposed in this application is
innovative because it represents a dramatic paradigm shift in the scientific approach to PAD. This proposal
places the investigative spotlight on the interplay between the immune system and skeletal muscle repair in
PAD. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to provide a strong scientific justification for
the continued investigation of muscle specific approaches, particularly immune-based strategies, for limb
preservation in PAD patients."

Accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) into Lewy Bodies and Lewy Neurites is a hallmark of the Lewy Body
Dementias (LBD), Dementia with Lewy Bodies and Parkinson’s Disease-Dementia. Additionally, some brain
regions in Alzheimer’s Disease have pathological α-syn. Therefore, α-syn is likely a major cause of cognitive
decline across several dementias. One possible mechanism underlying the core cognitive impairments centered
around impaired executive function in LBD may be loss or dysfunction of projection neurons from the basal
forebrain that produce acetylcholine (ACh). Across LBD, there is profound loss of cholinergic cells of the basal
forebrain, which project to the prelimbic medial prefrontal cortex (PL-mPFC), a known key brain nucleus for
executive function. Basal forebrain ACh acts through nicotinic and muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChR) to
modulate PL-mPFC glutamatergic projection neurons critical for normal executive function. Recent evidence has
further refined the mechanisms by which ACh regulates the PL-mPFC, and has suggested a key role for the M1
mAChR in regulating executive function. Despite this critical neuromodulatory role of ACh and M1 in the PL-mPFC
in executive function, there are few studies that examine this important relationship in the context of α-syn related
dementias. This has led to our overall hypothesis that cognitive decline in the context of α-syn linked
dementias results from disrupted ACh signaling in the mPFC. We have used the pre-formed fibril (PFF)
model of α-synucleinopathies to show that inputs into the PL-mPFC show enhanced ACh dependent long term
depression in PFF injected mice. Additionally, layer 5 pyramidal cells of the PL-mPFC show decreased excitability
in PFF injected mice compared to controls that may be attributable to ACh dependent changes in intrinsic
properties of these cells. This suggests that α-syn dysregulates multiples aspects of the PL-mPFC through
alterations in ACh release or signaling. To rigorously test this, we will perform a series of electrophysiology and
behavioral experiments to determine, define, and dissect how α-ayn dysregulates the PL-mPFC through loss of
ACh signaling or release. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that α-syn dysregulates PL-mPFC inputs through
altering ACh signaling. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that α-syn alters intrinsic properties and output of PL-
mPFC projection neurons through loss of ACh signaling. In aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that boosting
cholinergic signaling will rescue deficits in executive function. Completion of these aims will provide fundamental
understanding of how α-syn dysregulates ACh signaling to impair executive function in LBD."

In a well-received preprint, the investigator identified through unbiased analysis of own and published datasets
that during aging, and infection of the lung with influenza A, there is a progressive imbalance in the transcript
levels encoded by short genes relative to those encoded by long genes. Failure of gene expression homeostasis
impacts the rheostatic ability of almost all cellular processes implicated in aging impairing organ function,
particularly in response to systemic stress. Transcriptome imbalance could account for manifestations of aging
through several potential mechanisms, including: 1) The dysregulation of individual genes, 2) A dysregulation of
the stoichiometry of macromolecular complexes, 3) A relative upregulation of short early-response inflammatory
genes, 4) A breakdown of the coordination between molecular pathways and processes encoded by genes of
different lengths and 5) A reduction in the capacity of protein homeostasis and cell stress responses to respond
towards external stimuli by sequestering its activity toward a buffering of transcriptome imbalance. The
investigator will test the hypothesis that during aging transcriptome imbalance globally interferes with the
functions encoded by the genome and contributes to the loss of resilience in older individuals. To
address this fundamental question, he will focus on innovative mammalian ex vivo, in vitro, and in vivo models
of age-dependent transcriptome imbalance, and machine-learning approaches. Reflecting the interdisciplinary
character, he will work under the supervision of his main mentor Dr. Amaral, a network scientist and data-
scientist, and his co-mentor Dr. Morimoto, a molecular biologist studying protein homeostasis and aging. Further
marking his transition to independence, he will be mentored by Dr. Budinger, an immunologist studying changes
in immune aging, and Dr. McNally, a geneticist and bioinformatician, which is not part of a project grant of his
mentors. Aim 1 (K99): To determine whether SFPQ regulates transcriptome imbalance in aging. Aim 2 (K99):
To determine whether adaptive changes in proteostasis buffer transcriptome imbalance during aging after
influenza A pneumonia. Aim 3 (R00): To causally link transcriptome imbalance to the age-related susceptibility
to influenza A pneumonia. Importantly, the investigator’s mentoring committee has a very strong track record of
training postdoctoral fellows in transitioning into independent investigators. He will engage in seminars and learn
recent experimental techniques, grant writing, bioethics training, and training on running a laboratory, and obtain
additional off-site training on the biology of aging in mice with the purpose to facilitate collaborations. Combining
the new skills learned during his K99 mentored phase with his prior expertise in data science and transcriptomics
will ensure a strong technical foundation to launch an independent laboratory on gene expression homeostasis
in aging and the mechanisms underlying multi-system dysfunction."

In this proposal we plan to contribute addressing the above foundational and operational
challenges by advancing the science of influenza modeling and contributing novel methods and
data sources that will increase the accuracy and availability of seasonal and pandemic influenza
models. To address these challenges, we plan to build on the unique mechanistic spatially
structured modeling approaches developed by our consortium, that includes stochastic
metapopulation models and fully developed agent-based models nested together in our global
epidemic and mobility modeling (GLEAM) approach.
The objective of this project is to generate novel and actionable scientific insights from
dynamic transmission models of influenza transmission that effectively integrate key
socio-demographic indicators of the focus population, as well as a wide spectrum of
pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions. Our proposed work in specific aim 1
(A1) will leverage our global modeling (from the global to local scale) framework that can be used
to explore the multi-year impact of influenza vaccination, antiviral prophylaxis/treatment, and
community mitigation during influenza seasons and pandemics. Our specific aim 2 (A2) will focus
on using high quality data to model heterogeneous transmission drivers and novel contact pattern
stratifications that will allow us to guide mitigation strategies and prioritization for interventions. In
our Aim 3 (A3) we will use artificial intelligence approaches to identify interventions that are
particularly synergistic and well-suited to particular epidemic scenarios, for seasonal and
pandemic influenza. Our overarching goal is to provide a modeling portfolio with flexible and
innovative mathematical and computational approaches. We aim to address several questions
commonly asked about seasonal and pandemic influenza and match these with analytical
methods and outbreak projections. The modeling and data developed in this project can help
facilitate and justify transparent public health decisions, while contributing to the definition of
standard methods for model selection and validation. Finally, our influenza modeling platform can
also benefit the broader network of modeling teams and can be used to improve result sharing
and harmonization of modeling approaches."
10984178,"Project Abstract
Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common musculoskeletal disorder, presenting a large societal burden and
affecting over 300 million worldwide. Knee pain in patients with knee OA is a leading contributor to physical
disability and a major reason for hospital visits. Prior studies that have examined the determinants of knee
pain have not considered the complexity of knee pain reporting systematically (e.g., localized, regional or
diffuse knee pain). Moreover, the existing approaches focus on accurate prediction of knee pain and have
limitation on the interpretability. There is, therefore, a critical need to address this crucial void by developing
the computational tools with accurate prediction and interpretable properties.
The overall goal of this research is to is to build computational tools to accurately predict different incident
frequent knee pain spatial patterns and interpret the association between these knee pain patterns and the
structural abnormalities (i.e., Bone Marrow Lesions (BML)) detected on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).
The central hypothesis is that early in the disease course, abnormalities of structural features on knee MRI
will be determinants of specific knee pain spatial patterns.
This study is innovative in that it focuses on incident knee pain, examining knee pain spatial patterns early in
the disease course, and taking into account different definitions of knee pain. This study is also innovative in
that the study team will leverage excellent prediction performance of deep learning and interpretable
properties of statistical approaches to predict and understand different knee pain spatial patterns.
The specific aims are 1) To adapt a Transformer-based deep learning approach for predicting the incident
localized, regional, or diffuse knee pain from MRIs in the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI), and 2) to develop a
novel interpretable statistical framework for characterizing the relationship between BMLs on MRIs and
incident localized, regional, or diffuse knee pain."

Our preliminary studies show that the APP E590D variant, identified in two AD patients’ brains, substantially
induces more Aβ than APP-WT in vitro cell line and primary mouse cortical neurons. This APP E590D variant
also significantly increases APP protein stability and APP protein's endocytic process more than APP-WT.
Compared to APP-WT and many other APP mutants, APP E590D generates not only Aβ peptide but also another
extracellular 15kda fragment. Therefore, we take advantage of the human neurons directly converted from
primary fibroblasts to test the hypothesis that APP E590D promotes Aβ pathology while inducing abnormal
endocytosis of APP protein, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impairment of synaptic integrity in human neurons.
Unlike most other classified pathogenic APP missense variants located in the Aβ sequence or C terminus, the
APP E590D variant site is six residues away from the β-cleavage site beyond the Aβ sequence at the N terminus
APP protein, which results in a very conservative protein structure. Considering the patient carrying the APP
E590D variant has not only excessive amyloid deposition but also shows other non-AD-associated
neuropsychological dysfunctions at a very young age, we will (1) identify new C terminal cleavage site of APP
beyond the β-secretase cleavage using a mass spectrometry approach; (2) generate Aβ sequence-humanized
APP E590D knock-in mouse model of AD and test the pathogenic role of APP E590D in vivo.
The successful conclusion of these studies will (1) determine the pathogenic role of APP E590D in human
neurons and mice brains in vivo and uncover a new APP cleavage site with its unique fragment from APP E590D;
(2) provide a new APP E590D-based knock-in animal model of AD for other investigators in the field."
10992102,"Background: The suicide rate among female Veterans increased 63% between 2000 and 2014 – significantly
higher than the 30% increase observed among male Veterans during this period. Despite a large volume of
work examining risk factors, barriers to care, and care utilization among Veterans, little research has examined
these issues as they relate to females. Available research has been limited by small female sample sizes,
cross-sectional analysis, and other methodological limitations. As such, we know surprisingly little about the
health and psychosocial factors, barriers to care, and healthcare utilization patterns associated with suicidal
behaviors among female Veterans. Data on female risk for suicide and their healthcare utilization is needed to
direct valuable suicide prevention resources and help VHA address this growing and serious problem.
Objectives: The goal of our research is to inform gender-tailored suicide prevention approaches, using a large,
national sample of female and male Veterans with recent non-fatal suicidal self-directed violence (SSV: fatal
and non-fatal suicide attempts). We aim to: 1) Develop and test explanatory models of female and male risk for
repeat SSV over 12 months, and 2) Identify similarities and differences in patterns of healthcare utilization,
coping strategies, and symptom change over time between female and male Veterans at risk for SSV.
Methods: This will be the first mixed-methods, longitudinal cohort study of Veterans with a history of SSV, and
is guided by a public health, social-ecological framework to facilitate examination of the range of proximal and
distal risks for SSV. First, we will identify and enroll 30 female and 30 male Veterans for whom a non-fatal SSV
event was recorded in a suicide behavior report in VA's Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW). These 60
Veterans will participate in qualitative interviews to gather data on Veterans' perspectives and experiences with
suicidal thoughts and SSV, their recovery needs and experiences with the recovery process, barriers and
facilitators to care, and how clinicians and the healthcare system could better identify and address the needs of
Veterans like them. We will use a grounded theory approach to analyze transcripts to develop a theoretical
model of risk for SSV among female Veterans, directly informing survey construct selection, quantitative
analysis plans, and interpretation of quantitative findings. For the longitudinal survey, we will use suicide
behavior reports in CDW to identify and enroll at least 480 female and 480 male Veterans, who will complete
health and psychosocial measures at baseline, 6- and 12-month follow up. Self-report questionnaires will be
informed by the qualitative findings and include psychosocial and health-related measures such as coping
efficacy, interpersonal conflict, positive relations with others, trauma, occupational problems, barriers to care,
and mental health symptoms. Participants will be followed for 12 months to assess and document all SSV
events (primary outcome: an SSV event following baseline), which will be ascertained via multiple sources.
Health and utilization data will be obtained from CDW and medical record progress notes. Main quantitative
analyses will use a latent variable modeling framework to simultaneously model males and females in a multi-
group format to test models of female and male Veteran suicide risk. We will then use latent class and latent
transition analysis to identify differential responses to healthcare utilization and how certain health and
psychosocial variables cluster together by gender.
Significance: Findings from this study will provide previously unavailable evidence to support the selection of
intervention targets as well as identify high-priority services and barriers to care to direct programing and
research priorities for female Veterans at risk for SSV. This work has the potential to also benefit the broader
population of female Veterans with mental health conditions or other risk factors for SSV."

10996700,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a devastating disease with no effective therapeutic options for patients suffering from
advanced metastasis. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) offer promising treatment potential for a small subset
of patients with microsatellite instable (MSI)/mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) tumors. However, most CRC
patients have microsatellite stable (MSS)/mismatch repair proficient (pMMR) tumors that respond poorly to ICIs.
There is therefore an urgent need to identify novel targets and biomarkers of response to immunotherapy in MSS
tumors, which constitute over 90% of metastatic CRC. ZFP36L2, an RNA-binding protein mutated in 5-10% of
CRC, is a member of the TIS11 gene family which is known to suppress inflammation by blocking the expression
of proinflammatory chemokine and cytokine mRNAs in immune cells. Preliminary data from our lab suggests
that loss of ZFP36L2 function in human CRC leads to increased T cell recruitment into the normally
immunologically “cold” tumor microenvironment (TME) of MSS/dMMR TME. These data suggest that ZFP36L2
may also suppress the translation of cytokines and chemokines in CRC as a mechanism of immune evasion,
and further that ZFP36L2 mutations may give rise to increased immune cell infiltration into CRC tumors, which
may enhance responses to immunotherapy. To address this, we have developed a novel syngeneic mouse
ZFP36L2 knockout CRC organoid model and a ZFP36L2 knockout genetically engineered mouse CRC model.
These tools will allow us to delineate the ability of ZFP36L2 to regulate the inflammatory secretome of CRC
(Aim1) and assess how ZFP36L2 mutations impact the composition and functionality of the TME in CRC (Aim
2). This research will elucidate the functional consequences of mutations in ZFP36L2, whose function in human
cancer is poorly understood. More broadly, our work will increase our understanding of how tumors shape their
local immune environment to support disease progression. Our interrogation of the role of ZFP36L2 in CRC will
address critical unmet needs to develop novel treatment strategies for MSS CRC and identify clinically actionable
biomarkers of response to immunotherapy. This work has the potential to significantly improve the survival and
quality of life for CRC patients."

This collaborative project integrates fundamental molecular biology, cell level biophysics, animal-level
physiology, and computer modeling to advance understanding of molecular mechanisms by which inherited
mutations in cardiac myosin binding protein C (cMyBP-C) cause disease. Some individuals who inherit mutations
in this protein are at increased risk of developing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy but clinicians know that not all
mutations lead to significant disease. Linking genotype to phenotype is particularly challenging for missense
mutations as these often cause cMyBP-C molecules with abnormal function to be expressed in a patient’s heart.
More than 1000 missense mutations have already been identified but there is rarely enough clinical information
to determine the severity and/or best treatments for a given variant. Therefore, most are still characterized as
variants of unknown significance. Further, the field’s understanding of the basic mechanisms by which missense
mutations in cMyBP-C cause disease is limited because cMyBP-C exhibits complex behaviors and it’s N-terminal
and central domains can impact contractile function in diverse ways by interacting with both myosin and actin.
While it seems likely that the mutation’s location on the molecule determines its impact on contractile function,
mechanistic analyses of the region-specific molecular underpinnings of cMyBP-C missense variants has not yet
been performed.
The large number of variants makes it impractical to create animal or cell-based models for each missense
mutation. This project advances the field by combining strategically selected biological experiments with
computer modeling to develop a data-driven pipeline that can ultimately be used to identify which missense
mutations currently classified as variants of unknown significance pose the greatest risk to patients and the best
way to treat each variant.
To address this important problem we assembled a multidisciplinary research that will integrate experimental
approaches that span temporal and spatial scales, and complementary expertise in basic mechanisms of
cMyBP-C and clinical presentation of cMyBP-C related HCM. The research plan has 3 Aims:
 1) Predict the mechanisms and severity of missense mutations in cMyBP-C that cause hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy.
 2) Test predictions of cardiac phenotype using AAV9 to express mutant cMyBP-C in mouse hearts.
 3) Use a data-driven mechanistic approach to determine the most effective treatment for cMyBP-C variants.
The plan is highly innovative and makes intelligent use of the skills and resources of four leading investigators.
The team are committed to developing shared resources and will publish their computer code as open-source
projects as well as sharing their cell and animal-level data as freely-accessible databases to accelerate future
research."
10996621,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer therapy, providing lifesaving treatments for an
increasing number of malignancies. However, ICIs have also been associated with off-target multi-organ
immune-related adverse events, including an increasing incidence of cardiovascular toxicities. After early
reports of acute fulminant ICI-myocarditis, active surveillance of ICI cardiotoxicity using cardiac biomarkers
such as troponin-I has been recommended. This has resulted in the increased detection of asymptomatic, low-
grade cases of unknown natural history and clinical significance.
This study will address critical knowledge gaps by investigating risk stratification and outcomes
across the entire spectrum of ICI cardiotoxicity subtypes. The applicant’s central hypothesis is that a
subset of patients with abnormal troponin-I levels who are asymptomatic have lower risks of adverse cardiac
outcomes compared to those with symptomatic disease, and peripheral biomarkers like troponin-I and novel
immune markers can help distinguish between “higher” and “lower” risk patients who may tolerate safe
continuation of ICIs. To test this hypothesis, the applicant will (1) retrospectively examine cardiac and
oncologic outcomes associated with ICI cardiotoxicity stratified by patient symptoms and troponin-I
measurements; (2) retrospectively examine the risks of ICI continuation after asymptomatic troponin-I elevation
during ICI therapy; and (3) prospectively investigate the role of cardiac, established inflammatory, and novel
immune biomarkers in predicting cardiac risks after ICI continuation. These aims will leverage comprehensive
data from the Stanford Troponin Monitoring Cohort, consisting of > 1591 consecutive cancer patients with
prospectively collected serial troponin-I measurements during each cycle of ICIs, and the International ICI-
Myocarditis Registry of > 700 patients with confirmed ICI-myocarditis.
The results of this study will lead to critical advances in the field of cardio-oncology by enhancing
cardiac risk assessment for ICIs and establishing, for the first time, the role of biomarkers in evaluating
the risks of ICI continuation after troponin-I elevation. This will have serious implications for the safe
continuation of potentially lifesaving cancer therapies in affected patients. Through this fellowship training, the
applicant will also gain important competencies to advance in her long-term goal of becoming a leading
physician-scientist in the clinical phenotyping of cardiotoxicity from cancer therapies and forging evidence-
based practices in cardio-oncology."
10996437,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Background: VDJ recombination, Class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM) are
three B lymphocyte-specific processes that mediate antibody gene diversification. VDJ recombination requires
the DNA double-strand break generation by the recombination activation genes (RAG1 and RAG2) whereas
CSR and SHM require the single-strand DNA break activity of the activation induced deaminase (AID) enzyme.
Both RAG1/2 and AID activities are coupled with noncoding RNA transcription at sites of DNA break/mutation.
The properties of the ncRNAs generated at sites of programmed DNA breaks are poorly characterized in B-
cells. Recently advances in biology have provided compelling evidence that post-transcriptional and co-
transcriptional regulation of chromatin associated noncoding regulatory RNAs expressed from the IgH
locus (here, nomenclatured as VDJ-carRNA) and their modifications may have significant roles in driving B cell
development and function and prevention of THES immunodeficiency, a severe inherited disorder. In this
application, supported by preliminary data generated in our laboratory, we are evaluating the role of VDJ-
carRNA in early B cell development and VDJ recombination.
Objective/Hypothesis: VDJ-carRNAs expressed from the IgH locus of immature B cells are processed by the
RNA exosome complex to promote VDJ recombination via mechanisms that are relevant for RAG enzyme
activity.
Specific aims: Aim 1: Can B cell development be rescued in exosome deficient mice; Aim 2: Are specific RNA
helicases important for B cell development and VDJ recombination?; Aim 3: Do VDJ-carRNAs influence VDJ
recombination efficiency?
Study Design: Using cell lines and mouse models, we will study potential mechanisms by which RNA
exosome and substrate chromatin associated regulatory ncRNAs (VDJ-carRNA) on the IgH locus play roles in
orchestrating VDJ recombination. We will generate direct evidence that in the absence of RNA exosome and
its essential helicase cofactors B cell development is attenuated due to a direct defect in VDJ recombination.
We will use a combination of various genomic and biochemical tools to elucidate the associated mechanisms.
Disease Relevance: B cells are a central component of the adaptive immune response, but also prone to
undergo leukemias and lymphomas when antibody gene diversification processes are not well controlled.
Moreover, B cells deficient in RNA exosome demonstrate trichohepatoenteric (THES) syndrome, a B cell
immune system disease."
10997711,"ABSTRACT
A first-line treatment for head and neck cancer is radiation therapy, but ionizing radiation can lead to chronic oral
complications such as fibrosis of the salivary glands (SG) and xerostomia. Therapeutic strategies to restore SG
function include gene therapy, stem cell transplantation and various bioengineering approaches; however, they
are dependent on the presence of residual functional SG tissue, a condition not met with full radiation treatment
due to extensive fibrotic coverage of the SG. Although a role for Lysyl Oxidase (LOX) in radiation-induced fibrosis
has not been investigated in SG, it is notable that each LOX family member has been implicated in various
fibrotic disorders affecting a wide range of organs. This has prompted efforts to develop monoclonal antibodies
targeting specific LOX enzymes; however, recent Phase II clinical trials of a monoclonal antibody against Lysyl
Oxidase-Like (LOXL2) failed to show efficacy against primary sclerosing cholangitis. These findings underscore
the importance of considering functional redundancy when targeting individual LOX and since the catalytic site
of all LOX family members possesses a conserved binding site for copper (Cu), focusing on inhibition of Cu
delivery to these enzymes is a novel antifibrotic strategy. Preliminary studies have identified a novel compound,
MKV3, as a potent inhibitor of the ATP7A copper transporter. Furthermore, ATP7A trafficking to the plasma
membrane enhances LOX activity in cancer cells which is blocked by MKV3. Ionizing radiation was found to
stimulate Cu-dependent ATP7A trafficking in rat parotid Par-C10 cells and that copper modulators, such as
tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) and MKV3, block this process. To extend these findings to in vivo studies, preliminary
results indicate that radiation treatment not only triggers Cu-dependent ATP7A trafficking in mouse
submandibular glands (SMG) from the perinuclear region to the plasma membrane but also causes collagen
deposition of extracellular matrix, with these events being reduced by TTM. Finally, ATP7A localization was
found to be altered in the fibrotic SMG of irradiated patients, thus indicating a likelihood for clinical applications
of these findings. Based on the above, it is hypothesized that ionizing radiation triggers Cu-stimulated ATP7A
trafficking in SG, which facilitates the metalation of LOX enzymes leading to increasing collagen crosslinking and
fibrosis. Therefore, the following Aims are proposed: Aim 1 will elucidate the molecular mechanisms of altered
Cu homeostasis in irradiated SG. Aim 2 will evaluate the therapeutic potential of SMG-specific Atp7a gene
silencing on radiation-induced fibrosis and saliva secretion. Aim 3 will evaluate the therapeutic effects of
pharmacological targeting of copper transport on radiation-induced SMG fibrosis. Together, these studies will
demonstrate that targeting of Cu metabolism can be used as a novel treatment for radiation-induced SG fibrosis."
10998197,"PROJECT SUMMARY
One of the most critical social decisions that animals make is whether to approach or ignore a
conspecific based off of previous interactions. For instance, mice will readily investigate novel
conspecifics while avoiding familiar conspecifics. Emerging research has established that the
ventral hippocampus (vHPC) is necessary for discriminating between novel and familiar
conspecifics. However, it remains unclear how novelty recognition information encoded by the
vHPC is transformed by a series of downstream brain regions to guide subsequent behaviors
such as social approach and investigation. The lateral septum (LS) receives strong projections
from the vHPC, and it in turn projects to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a region that promotes
social approach and affiliation. Therefore, the LS is ideally positioned to integrate recognition
information from the vHPC and in turn promote investigation through its projection to the NAc. In
this proposed project, I will leverage sophisticated in vivo recording techniques, projection-specific
optogenetic stimulation, and novel computational approaches to elucidate the role of the vHPC-
dLS-NAc pathway in novelty-related social investigation. In Aim 1, I will use cellular resolution
calcium imaging to determine how social recognition information and motivated social behaviors
are encoded in vHPC-LS and LS-NAc projection populations. In Aim 2, I will optogenetically excite
and inhibit LS-NAc neurons to determine if this projection is causally involved in regulating
investigation of a novel conspecific. Completion of these aims will answer a fundamental question
regarding how sensory information of a social stimulus is transformed into motivated social
behavior. Additionally, findings from this study will open avenues for future research that can
explore how this pathway might be disrupted in disorders that impact social recognition such as
Alzheimer’s Disease."

Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is the second most common cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) before age
twenty-five. The spectrum of disease is defined by response to steroids, divided into steroid resistant nephrotic
syndrome (SRNS) and steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS). SRNS has limited therapeutic options and
often progresses to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and ESKD, while SSNS carries significant morbidity due to
long-term treatment with non-specific immunosuppression. We aim to improve our understanding of the genetic
drivers of NS to more precisely guide clinical management and create targeted therapies.
The past two decades have seen an increased understanding of the genetic basis of NS, particularly in the
discovery of Mendelian causes of NS. Mendelian forms of NS are primarily recessive, with two pathogenic
variants being essentially fully penetrant for the more severe form of NS, SRNS. The first recessive Mendelian
NS gene discovered was nephrin (NPHS1). In keeping with this inheritance model, the heterozygous state has
been thought to be clinically silent – a true “carrier” state. Recently, a published analysis of a Finnish population
cohort (FinnGen) challenged that model by showing that carriers of “Fin-Major”, a specific NPHS1 loss-of-
function Mendelian founder mutation in Finns, have increased odds of kidney disease. Additionally, genome
wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated common variants in NPHS1 with increased risk of SSNS,
reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and lower serum albumin. Taken together, these
discoveries suggest that forms of genetic variation beyond bi-allelic Mendelian variants, such as heterozygous
rare pathogenic coding variants and common regulatory variants, may alter NPHS1 function and contribute to
kidney dysfunction and disease.
The overall goal of my project is to discover the association of coding and non-coding NPHS1 variants across the
allele frequency spectrum with diverse kidney diseases and traits. More specifically, I hypothesize that in the
general population, heterozygous, pathogenic Mendelian NPHS1 variants and common risk variants discovered
by GWAS are associated with lower eGFR, higher urine protein levels, and increased odds of nephrotic syndrome.
To test this hypothesis, I propose testing the following specific aims amongst 1.5 million people enrolled in
multiple large population- and hospital system-based biorepositories:
Aim 1: Discover the clinical consequences of Fin-Major carrier state in the FinnGen cohort.
Aim 2: Discover the prevalence and clinical impact of rare and common NPHS1 variants in 5
hospital based and population cohorts collectively totaling approximately 1,500,000 individuals."

Eden Medical is pleased to develop the Smart Foot Mat (SfM), as a simple in-home appliance for
stopping diabetic foot complications. We propose a powerful game-changing strategy having
diabetics step on their smart mat at home once a day to monitor their foot oximetry and
temperature over time to alert them early signs of ulcer onset. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)
biomarkers provide a quantitative ulcer risk metric and can used to predict diabetic foot onset.
Complications of diabetes that affect the lower extremities are common, complex, and costly.
Diabetes is the most common metabolic disease worldwide with global cost of diabetes
management including foot ulceration is now $825 billion dollars every year. Foot ulceration is
the most frequently recognized complication with 537 million adults who live with diabetes
globally and it predicted to rise to 643 million by 2030. Recent investigations suggest that 40%
of patients experience a recurrent diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) in the year after healing, and almost
60% within 3 years. Daily in-home monitoring will provide ulcer-free living for high-risk
diabetic patients."

In the US, sexual and gender minority (SGM) older adults are disproportionately at risk for Alzheimer’s disease
and related dementias (AD/ADRD) and more likely to rely on long-term services and supports (LTSS) than their
cisgender, heterosexual peers. Without training in culturally responsive care of the LTSS workforce, SGM
residents are vulnerable to receiving inappropriate and/or inferior care contributing to poorer quality of life and
health outcomes. To address this, some states have recently mandated training of the LTSS workforce in the
culturally responsive care of SGM older adults. There are two major barriers to this approach being successful.
First, we lack research on LTSS policies governing SGM with AD/ADRD care (in states where cultural care
training is not mandated), which would inform whether such state legislation is needed. Second, there are no
scalable, sustainable, evidence-based training programs to train the LTSS workforce in SGM with AD/ADRD
culturally responsive care. This application is focused on the Training to Serve curriculum, which has trained
over 12,000 LTSS workers in 12 states. This acceptable, feasible, and promising curriculum employs a
multilevel approach to train management and frontline LTSS staff in culturally responsive care to SGM with
AD/ADRD. But it has not been rigorously evaluated and relies solely on in person instruction. This mixed
methods and comparative effectiveness study has three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will conduct a
comprehensive policy analysis of 362 nursing homes and 362 assisted living facilities in Minnesota to assess
the number and proportion of agencies that have explicit SGM affirmative policies in human resources,
marketing, training, governance; anti-discrimination policies guiding culturally responsive care, and resident
sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data collection. These findings will inform Aim 2 curriculum. In
Aim 2, to make Training to Serve more scalable nationally and with high fidelity, we will design and develop an
asynchronous online version and pilot it with 30 LTSS management and 30 staff. In Aim 3, to assess the effects
of training, we will conduct a 3-arm, management/staff stratified, group randomized, controlled trial of the in-
person training versus an online curriculum versus a waitlist control group (in 62 LTSS agencies, with 310
management and 450 staff per arm). At the individual level, we will assess management and staff knowledge,
attitudes, and skills providing care to SGM clients. At the agency level, at six months follow-up, we predict
agencies who receive training will have more SGM explicit policies, more SGM welcoming environments, SOGI
data collection at intake, and staff with significantly greater knowledge, comfort, and skills in providing SGM
with AD/ADRD culturally responsive care."

11005360,"Project Summary/Abstract
The goal of this project is to develop a prototype instrument and techniques for photochemical patterning
of lipids in tissue sections for mass spectrometry structural analysis and imaging. The proposed instrument
uses focused laser beams to drive photochemical reactions in the tissue that tag lipid double bond locations.
The tissue is then analyzed using a commercial matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass
spectrometer. Fragmentation of the lipids by tandem mass spectrometry produces diagnostic ions that reveal
the lipid double bond location that is otherwise indiscernible.
Lipids are important cellular components and important in the diagnosis and treatment of many diseases.
Mass spectrometry is a powerful method for identifying and quantifying lipids in tissue and mass
spectrometry imaging can localize lipids in tissue at spatial resolution approaching cellular precision. One
of the greatest challenges in mass spectrometry of lipids is determining the structure of these structurally
and biochemically diverse compounds. Determining the location of double bonds in unsaturated lipids can
be accomplished using photochemical reactions such as the Paterno-Büchi carbonyl cycloaddition reaction
which forms products that readily fragment in mass spectrometry experiments to reveal lipid structure. The
device to be developed in this project allows photochemical reactions to be performed on tissue sections
with selected patterns that facilitate identification and distribution of lipids.
This project will develop new technology for patterned tissue photochemistry for mass spectrometry
imaging. The process is general and applicable not only to lipid identification but can also be applied to
protein photochemistry and structural analysis, lipid and protein photo-crosslinking, and photochemical
cage release reactions. The target commercial potential for this technology is clinical and research
laboratories using MALDI mass spectrometry imaging. This technology provides capabilities that are not
commercially available in any device and the system can be directly integrated into current mass
spectrometry imaging workflows."
11006241,"Proactive goals of care conversations (GoCCs) conducted in advance of clinical deterioration are a hallmark of
high-quality, patient-centered care. When done well, GoCCs allow healthcare providers to tailor end-of-life care
to patient values and improve key outcomes for patients, caregivers, providers, and the healthcare system.
Given the need for structures and processes to promote GoCCs, the VA National Center for Ethics in Health
Care implemented the Life-Sustaining Treatment Decisions Initiative (LSTDI) at all VA facilities in 2018 to
promote standardized documentation of GoCCs for Veterans at high risk of clinical deterioration. As of early
2020, proactive GoCCs remained vastly underutilized. The onset of the COVID pandemic reinforced the
need for and importance of GoCCs to guide end-of-life care, acting as a catalyst for innovations to
LSTDI implementation. In response to the pandemic, guidelines and lay media instilled a new urgency among
patients and providers to proactively discuss and document GoCCs. Many sites both within and outside of VA
developed innovations to facilitate proactive GoCCs, including outreach to high-risk patients (e.g., those with
dementia), holding GoCCs by telehealth (a new modality for these sensitive discussions), and tasking and
training outpatient providers previously unreached by the LSTDI with conducting GoCCs. [At least 40 VA
facilities have increased outpatient GoCCs in 2021 compared with pre-pandemic rates.]
[Yet it remains unknown how these sites increased and maintained GoCC rates, or whether COVID-catalyzed
LSTDI implementation innovations improved GoCC rates at the expense of GoCC quality or equity. Our
hypothesis is that some facilities prioritized outpatient LSTDI implementation during the pandemic, achieving
sustainable increases in both reach and quality of GoCCs without exacerbating disparities in GoCCs among
Black Veterans. From close evaluations of LSTDI implementation at selected sites, we will identify sustainable
innovations catalyzed by the pandemic that can be spread across VA to improve LSTDI implementation and
delivery of high-quality, equitable, patient-centered end-of-life care, even after the pandemic recedes.]
Our sequential explanatory mixed methods study is designed to [comprehensively assess the long-term
impact] of the COVID pandemic on LSTDI implementation and the frequency, quality, and equity of GoCCs.
We begin with time series analyses to examine how COVID affected LSTDI implementation across VA
facilities, with attention to [sustained] changes in reach to Veterans and adoption by providers (Aim 1). We will
then leverage time series and proportional hazard analyses to assess quality and equity of outpatient GoCCs,
as determined by documentation of National Quality Forum preferred practices in LSTDI notes (Aim 2a), and
length of time from GoCC to death, a marker of proactive advance care planning (Aim 2b). Finally, in Aim 3, we
will interview Veterans, providers, and leaders from [10] sites purposively selected based on Aims 1 and 2
findings to identify best practices to improve [and maintain frequency, quality, and equity of GoCCs, with
special attention to approaches to engage Black Veterans and patients with dementia]. Findings will inform a
playbook to improve quality, equity, and sustainability of LSTDI implementation.
The changes wrought by the pandemic to VA healthcare delivery created an unprecedented opportunity to
identify innovations, challenges, and unintended consequences in implementing the LSTDI, as well as
outcomes of GoCCs on quality and equity of end-of-life care delivered before, during, and after COVID. This
study is designed to leverage the unique circumstance and sense of urgency created by the pandemic and will
produce a usable deliverable: an implementation playbook capturing best practices and innovations catalyzed
by the pandemic. This work is strongly supported by our partners in the National Center for Ethics in Health
Care and the Office of Primary Care to help spread the LSTDI, and it is of central importance to achieving the
VA mandate to conduct GoCCs to improve the quality, equity, and patient-centeredness of end-of-life care."

Over one million Americans suffer from Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, an autoimmune disease for which there
is no cure. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus) is a chronic autoimmune disease. The disease
presentation is heterogenous, women are nine times more likely to develop SLE than men, and lupus is
significantly more prevalent in people of Asian, Hispanic, Native American, and African ancestry than people of
European ancestry. Lupus is a significantly understudied disease. Monozygotic twin concordance is found to be
as low as 25% and familial aggregation studies suggest that lupus results at least in part from genetic
predisposition. Most experts in the field agree that gene-environment interactions are important for lupus
development. Recent work from our laboratory suggests that aberrant DNA repair leads to the development of
lupus in a mouse model of the disease. We originally showed that a mutation in the POLB gene in mice results
in development of lupus as a result of defective VDJ recombination and somatic hypermutation. In collaboration
with Dr. Lindsey Criswell we have now identified a large number of coding germline variants that are enriched in
individuals with lupus. In preliminary research, we have demonstrated that mice harboring one of these variants
within the mismatch repair pathway develop high levels of antinuclear antibodies and lupus-associated lung
disease. We have shown that somatic hypermutation is abnormal in these mice and results in the production of
autoantibodies. Our RIVER project is focused on providing mechanistic insights into the development of lupus
as a result of gene-environment interactions. A challenge in the field is understanding how environmental
exposures influence lupus development. We suggest that many previous analyses may be underpowered
because the genetic predisposition factors of the individuals studied are likely to differ, and that genetic factors
play a significant role in the response of the organism to the environment. Our approach to address this challenge
is to construct mouse models of coding genetic variants in DNA repair genes that are significantly enriched in
individuals with lupus. This will be followed by characterization of the disease pathologies emerging in these
mice in the absence and presence of environmental exposures that are known to be linked to lupus development.
We will then take a combined genetic, molecular, and biochemical approach to elucidate underlying mechanistic
insights into the development of lupus. Our project has significant potential to uncover the genetic and
environmental bases of lupus development and to yield paradigm-shifting results that will impact the treatment
of this devastating disease."

Heart disease has been the leading cause of death in the United States and the world for more than a century,
ever since the early 1900s. About 697,000 people die of heart disease in the United States every year (CDC,
2022) and 17.9M death worldwide (WHO 2021). The epidemic burden is enormous; in 2016, cardiovascular
disease (CVD) cost $555 billion in the US alone and by 2035, the cost will skyrocket to $1.1 trillion (CDC, 2023)
A high cholesterol level is well-known risk factors for heart disease. Although blood cholesterol can be lowered
using a number of marketed drugs, of which statins are the leading drugs, in the US, more than 7M patients who
have high LDL-cholesterol are not sufficiently responsive to statin, and an additional 4M patients are statin
intolerance and 1.3M are familial hypercholesteremic (FH). These and other patients will substantially benefit
from a different mechanism for treatment of hypercholesterolemia. The long-term goal of this work is to develop
novel orally bioavailable drugs for cholesterol lowering. Our therapeutic target is the protease proprotein
convertase subtilisin-like kexin type 9 (PCSK9). PCSK9 controls the degradation of the LDL receptor (LDLR) in
the liver and thereby contributes to cholesterol homeostasis. PCSK9 is synthesized as a precursor protein that
undergoes processing. Secreted PCSK9 binds to the LDL-receptor (LDLR) and chaperones it to the degradation
pathway. To achieve our goal, we identified a nanomolar orally active small molecule PCSK9/LDLR antagonist
(P-21) that showed outstanding potency and safety profile in animal in vivo. The LDL-cholesterol lowering effect
of P-21 is as potent as the marketed monoclonal antibodies. Currently, we have completed bulk of the IND-
enabling studies, including the rats GLP toxicology. As part of this direct SBIR Phase II proposal, our goal is to
obtain funds that are urgently needed to support the dogs DRF, GLP toxicology, safety pharmacology and FDA
Regulatory Services which are crucial to successfully complete the IND-enabling study to initiate Phase-I clinical
trial."
11005852,"Project Summary/Abstract
Problem The prevalence of diabetes mellitus in the U.S. is high and increasing in both adults and children—over
1.5 million Americans are diagnosed with diabetes annually. Among the consequences of diabetes, diabetic
foot ulcers (DFUs) are a common and major complication, resulting in lower quality-of-life, hospitalization,
disability, amputation, and even death. DFUs are the leading cause of hospitalization and disability in patients
with diabetes, and are the largest category of excess medical costs associated with diabetes. In light of the
impending diabetes epidemic and the high prevalence and grave consequences of DFUs, the need for improved
prevention of DFUs and their recurrence is clear.
 The major risk factors for DFUs include diabetic peripheral neuropathy, peripheral arterial disease (PAD),
higher pressure on plantar surfaces, and an unsteady gait. DFUs can arise from acute trauma or from recurrent
weight-bearing activity that is undetectable by the patient due to insensate feet. Research suggests that active
management of foot health can prevent the occurrence and reoccurrence of a DFU; however, approaches must
be multifaceted and require continual monitoring from both patients and caregivers.
Solution The SoleSaver system is a sensor-enabled, unobtrusive, and non-binding foot-worn garment similar
to a sock that can be used to continually monitor multiple facets of foot health in order to maximize DFU
prevention and minimize DFU recurrence. SoleSaver measures both the pressure and temperature across the
plantar surface, tracks gait indices, and provides an index for PAD status and changes thereto. SoleSaver also
measures adherence to use of offloading or other prescribed footwear. SoleSaver collects data continuously and
relays measurements wirelessly to a portable computing device (e.g., a smartphone). A specialized software
application automatically generates interpretive reports for clinicians, sends reminders, and delivers timely alerts
and warnings to the patient. Compiled data and results are also offloaded to a secure, cloud-based provider
dashboard. The provider dashboard enables caregivers to securely and remotely review patient data and provide
clinical feedback and advice (e.g., “we need to adjust your offloading footwear”) without the need for burdensome
and costly office visits that only provide a snapshot picture of the patient’s foot health. The SoleSaver software
automatically generates clear, concise reports that include summary data to simplify interpretation by clinicians.
SoleSaver fulfills the need for an ergonomic, accurate, reliable, and low-cost DFU prevention system for use in
healthcare and clinical research.
 The proposed Phase I SBIR effort will demonstrate proof-of-concept and feasibility for the SoleSaver method-
ology via rigorous evaluation of a Phase I prototype on patients with diabetes and age- and sex-matched healthy
participants."

Late onset AD (LOAD) is a heterogeneous disease that involves complex interactions between genetic,
epigenetic, and environmental risk factors. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several
thousand sequence variants linked to increased or decreased risk of AD, most of which are noncoding. The
current paradigm posits that noncoding variants contribute to disease etiology by perturbing transcriptional
regulation in disease-relevant cell types, while environmental risk factors contribute to pathogenesis in part via
alterations to the epigenome. However, a lack of maps and tools to explore gene activities and their
transcriptional regulation at cellular resolution in the brain has presented a major bottleneck to the functional
interpretation of noncoding AD risk variants. In prior work, we applied Droplet Paired-Tag multi-omic profiling of
transcription and histone post-translational modification to post-mortem AD and control parietal cortex,
demonstrating its capacity to profile cellular epigenetics and transcription from bulk samples. This technology
has garnered significant interest through our early-access program. In the proposed study, we will develop a
manufacturing quality management system incorporating references and reference measurements for the
production of Droplet Paired-Tag Kits. We will optimize our protocols specifically on post-mortem AD and
healthy brain tissue from hippocampus, white matter, and cerebellum, as well as on peripheral blood; and
further optimize Droplet Paired-Tag for application to sorted nuclear populations. We will publish the resulting
data as a comprehensive cellular encyclopedia of DNA elements. If successful, the research would catalyze
the study of the epigenetics of AD, and enable the widespread application of next-generation multi-omic assays
to AD and other neurological diseases."

Paralytic Polio is a devastating cause of flaccid paralysis, and its eradication is a major initiative of the World
Health Organization (WHO). Eradication requires control of viral shedding and environmental transmission of
poliovirus (PV). Inactivated polio vaccines (IPVs) fail to establish mucosal immunity and viral shedding despite
generating protective antibody responses. Live attenuated oral poliovirus vaccines (OPVs) stimulate mucosal
immunity and limit transmission, but the viral strains used can revert to neurovirulence when shed in the feces
of vaccinees, thus sustaining a viral reservoir for environmental transmission. The candidate will maximize
evaluation of existing data and biospecimens from key clinical PV vaccine-challenge studies using vaccine
shedding as a gold standard assessment of effective antigen-specific mucosal immunity. Through the analyses
described, Dr. Crothers will characterize human immune responses during OPV infection to identify immunologic
target profiles associated with effective mucosal immunity, investigate the relative impact of two modifiable
variables (vaccine priming and the gut microbiota), and evaluate the potential of a novel mucosal adjuvant
(dmLT) to stimulate target immune profiles. This work aligns with the NIAID 2018 strategic plan on vaccine
adjuvants which highlights development of mucosal adjuvants and emphasizes maximizing evaluation of clinical
trial data to enhance our understanding of their mode of action. Through this K23 Mentored Clinical Scientist
Research Career Development Award, Dr. Crothers will pursue advanced training in clinical research and
computational techniques with a focus on data integration across clinical trials and data types. This work will
build on the candidate’s background of doctoral research training in immunology and microbiology and build new
skills in microbiome data analysis, bioinformatics, and novel computational approaches through formal
coursework and practical application. Situated in the stimulating environment of her primary mentor (Dr. B.
Kirkpatrick) at the University of Vermont Translational Global Infectious Diseases Research Group and Vaccine
Testing Center with easy access to the research groups of her co-mentor (Dr. P. Wright) and key advisor (Dr. A.
Hoen) at Dartmouth College, her work will be guided by a team of experts in poliovirus immunology,
computational methodologies, and translational research. This work will position the candidate to launch her
career as an independent physician scientist at the intersection of enteric infectious diseases and mucosal
immunology with a focus on harnessing the clinical potential of the human microbiome to prevent and treat
enteric diseases."
10983644,"The Neuropathologic Landscape of Alzheimer's Disease in Hispanic Decedents (R01 AG062517) commenced
in August of 2019 with the main objective to determine if the neuropathological landscape differs based on
Hispanic ethnicity. We made great strides in cycle 1 working around the constraints imposed by the pandemic.
We compiled demographic and clinical data, completed standardized histology, and detailed neuroanatomic
distributions of Alzheimer disease (AD) and related disorders (ADRDs) pathologies in 185 persons who identified
as non-Hispanic white (NHWs) and 92 as Hispanic decedents across three cohorts from University of California
Davis, Columbia University, and University of California San Diego. We formed a rich uniformly characterized
dataset with over 7,500 stained and evaluated slides (19 Terabytes), generating results supporting our central
hypothesis that Hispanic decedents have different neuropathologic landscapes when compared to NHWs,
revealing neuroanatomical and pathological specific differences. Specifically, the frontal cortex contained
statistically significant higher semi-quantitative densities of neuritic plaques and neuropil threads in persons of
Hispanic descent compared to age and gender-matched NHWs decedents while these pathologies had similar
densities in parietal and temporal cortices. Cycle 1 accomplished additional key goals including: review articles
promoting cohort diversity and deeper phenotyping of human tissues, methodologic papers on developing, and
enhancing pipelines for quantitative area-specific assessments of neuropathologies and understanding the
effects of pre-analytic variables on machine learning algorithms. Moreover, we expanded our impact by
engaging communities, focused on those who identify as Hispanic, as we piloted novel crowdsourcing methods
producing expert-like pathological analyses to ameliorate analytic bottlenecks in computational approaches
based on a type of machine learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this competitive renewal
application, we seek to leverage resources from cycle 1 of the application to further expand beyond non-Hispanic
White centric paradigms providing insight into three main questions: 1) How does the way we evaluate
pathologies alter demographic and clinical associations? 2) Can we use citizen science to engage the
communities, especially those of Hispanic/Latino descent and aid in ground truth datasets for AD pathologies as
well as provide outreach and educational opportunities? 3) how does Hispanic heritage (evaluating both self-
reported and genetic admixture) relate to pathologic, demographic, and clinical manifestations of AD? To provide
answers to these questions we will utilize an established multi-disciplinary group of experts and an established
diverse cohort of 277 individuals with 92 Hispanic/Latino decedents and expand innovative methods for scalable
quantitative neuropathology assessments. These synergistic yet independent questions will fill critical gaps to
provide refined objective quantitative understanding of neuropathologic differences, leading to better precision
medicine approaches especially for persons within the Hispanic community."

Substance use disorder (SUD) diagnosis and treatment requires laboratory drug testing, which
inflicts monetary, time, and interpersonal barriers to professional care. To date, there are no
remote, non-invasive and instant opioid testing options available, limiting the potential for clinical
outreach. Tenvos’ solution is an Artificial Intelligence based technology that detects opioid use
from 15 seconds of speech. Tenvos allows clinicians to screen for opioid use remotely,
mitigating the barriers to clinical intervention, streamlining the clinical workflows, reducing costs,
and improving the overall quality of patient care. Tenvos’ solution is an easily-deployable
API-first product, allowing for seamless integration into various workflows– integration with
virtual health platforms, phone appointments, or large scale automatic phone-based screening
campaigns. This new approach will increase access for rural and low-income populations as
well as incarcerated individuals.
This project aims to further develop Tenvos’ solution and the understanding of opioids’ effects
on voice production, while comparing the detection solution to current gold standard tests. The
specific aims for the project’s Phase I set of activities include: Aim 1: Collecting clinical data
from patients before and after the opioid treatment. Aim 2: Identifying 10 vocal characteristics
that are affected by opioid use and ranked from Most Affected to Least Affected. Aim 3:
Determining the accuracy of the machine learning model trained on this data measured by
Sensitivity and Specificity and 95% CI. This project will achieve the aforementioned aims
through a multisite observational study at Doctors Medical Center and Loma Linda University
Health. Selected patients in the sites’ emergency departments will provide voice samples prior
to and following opioid administration. This data collection will allow for vocal analysis to identify
characteristic differences between the voice samples taken before opioid administration and
those taken after. Furthermore, this sample collection will provide the initial feasibility data to
facilitate the necessary steps toward commercialization."

For half a century, groups across the world have been investigating the hypothesis that reactive oxygen
species influence the biology of aging. However, technical limitations have, until recently, heavily limited the
precision at which studies can interrogate this hypothesis. For example, reactive oxygen species are
known to post-translationally modify cysteine residues on proteins throughout the proteome, however,
only recently have proteomic techniques been developed allowing for deep and quantitative analysis of
cysteine oxidation on proteins in a biological sample. This proposal will develop preliminary data which
identified a broad increase in cysteine oxidation across 10,970 cysteines in the proteome in C. elegans during
aging and begin to link these events to regulation of the biology of aging. Specifically, this proposal will
focus on redox regulation of proteasome activity during aging. First, this proposal will determine the relative
contribution of cysteine oxidation to regulating age-dependent changes to proteasome activity. Second, this
proposal will identify and define regulatory cysteines involved in redox regulation of the proteasome and
determine their influence in the maintenance of longevity. Third, this proposal will generate new cysteine
oxidation data sets to determine how longevity interventions influence the trajectory of age-dependent
cysteine oxidation. Finally, this proposal will evaluate the intriguing hypothesis that reactive oxygen
species can be carefully titrated to promote fitness through stimulating dormant proteasome activity in
aged organisms. This work will synergistically employ the skillsets of multiple investigators to perform
impactful, cutting-edge research. In addition to providing significant insights into important areas of cell
biology, the proposed work will also contribute to the development of a future academic scientist at Harvard’s
T.H. Chan School of Public Health, one of the best places to receive scientific training in the world. These
studies will both develop a research program which the trainee can use to establish an independent, academic
scientific research group as well as equip the trainee with the skillset needed to be successful in this
professional domain. The trainee will receive experience in all areas required of a successful academic
investigator, such as mentoring, scientific communication, grant writing, project management and
budgeting and receive significant technical training in a new model system, new fields and many new
techniques. Together, this work will define fundamental mechanisms contributing to development of the
biology of aging with broad implications for human health and disease and provide strategies to promote
healthy aging."

The proposed R34 will develop and test digital helpline intervention components aimed at reducing heavy
episodic drinking (HED) during the first 3 months postpartum. HED is prevalent among women of reproductive
age, and more than half of women who reduce their drinking during pregnancy return to pre-pregnancy levels
within 3 months postpartum, making this a critical time for intervention. Addressing postpartum HED is key to
preventing negative maternal and child health outcomes, including fetal alcohol spectrum disorder in
subsequent pregnancies. Postpartum mothers are unlikely to seek treatment for HED, due to stigma and fear
of child removal. Helplines that use real-time synchronous text with a professional, as well as automated
messaging, are a promising mechanism for reaching postpartum mothers to deliver effective brief interventions
for HED, as they are widely accessible, convenient, free, and anonymous. The proposed study will apply the
Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) framework to develop standard helpline interventions (assessment,
psychoeducation, and links to resources), and evidence-based brief interventions for alcohol use (motivational
interviewing and coping skills training), all tailored to the postpartum period and delivered via scheduled
sessions of synchronous texting with a helpline specialist. The standard helpline component will also include
the asynchronous support typical of helplines. Following development, a pilot factorial trial will evaluate the
standard helpline interventions for this unique population, examine the feasibility and added value of evidence-
based brief interventions delivered via helpline, and assess the added impact of 4 weeks of automated
messages to provide ongoing reinforcement of intervention content. Specific aims are to (1) develop
intervention components, Helpline staff training, and fidelity monitoring protocols via an iterative user-centered
design process with 15 mothers, 5 helpline specialists, and an expert panel; and (2) conduct a pilot 2X2X2
factorial trial with 120 new mothers to assess feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity of each intervention
component, and obtain preliminary proof-of-concept effects of intervention components on proximal
(motivation, self-efficacy, and self-regulation) and distal (quantity and frequency of HED) outcomes to prepare
for a future fully-powered optimization trial. Study products will be a set of piloted intervention components for
delivery via digital helpline, ready for optimization and evaluation in an R01. Partnership to End Addiction’s
existing Helpline infrastructure will support future testing and ultimate scalability."
10984689,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Patients who undergo cardiac surgeries to establish the Fontan circulation (FC) suffer from lifelong complications
and early mortality. Engaging in physical activity (PA) may help to counteract these negative consequences.
Youth with the FC engage in less physical activity (PA) than their peers and demonstrate decreased aerobic
performance and lower skeletal muscle mass portending worse clinical outcomes. We now know that patients
with the FC can safely engage in PA and improve their aerobic exercise performance in hospital-based exercise
programs. Unfortunately, these programs are highly selective, costly, and inconvenient, and thus not
generalizable or equitable. Digital health applications can mitigate these barriers by remotely promoting PA
beyond the point of care, especially with caregiver support. However, gaps in knowledge remain about whether
a home-based digital intervention can 1) increase PA and 2) improve aerobic performance and increase skeletal
muscle mass and muscle strength, in youth with the FC. Thirdly, from an equity standpoint, it is not known how
individual, family and neighborhood level factors influence the effectiveness of a home-based PA intervention.
Thus, there is a critical need to develop and test innovative digital interventions to improve PA and clinical
outcomes among all youth with the FC. The study team’s objective is to evaluate the efficacy of a digital
intervention to increase PA and clinically relevant measures of physical fitness in youth with the FC. To
accomplish this, the team proposes a randomized controlled trial with three specific aims. A wrist-worn physical
activity tracker will be given to all participants, but they will be randomized to “enhanced usual care” (tracker plus
standard encouragement to exercise) or a digital PA intervention for 6-months. The intervention arm will include:
(1) personalized aerobic-based physical activity, (2) personalized resistance exercise sessions, and (3) financial
and non-financial engagement strategies, targeting youth and caregivers. These intervention components will
be delivered using an advanced mobile health informatics platform. Clinical assessments will be made at
baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Under aim 1, we will determine if the multi-component digital intervention
increases PA levels in youth with the FC. Under aim 2, we will determine if the intervention leads to
improvements in physical fitness outcomes (aerobic capacity, muscle mass, and strength). Finally, under aim
3, we will test whether medical, neurodevelopmental, sociodemographic and/or neighborhood factors, are
associated with the efficacy of the digital intervention, using qualitative and quantitative approaches. It is
anticipated that the digital intervention will significantly increase PA and improve physical fitness. Further,
multi-level factors will be identified that associate with the efficacy of the intervention, thus providing
the foundation for future implementation trials. These findings will lead to the integration of equitable
and sustainable digital PA interventions for youth with a FC in the pediatric cardiology clinical setting."
10984776,"Abstract Diet and nutrition influence our cognitive abilities, how our brains age, and vulnerability to
neurodegeneration. However, the interaction of diet with the human brain is complex and influenced by every
person’s unique genetic composition. Clinical studies found that ketogenic diets and supplements improve
cognition and protect against Alzheimer's disease (AD) in most individuals but have no beneficial effect on
individuals with the strongest genetic risk factor for AD, APOE4. How APOE4 interacts with diet at the cellular
and molecular level to influence AD is unknown. The primary metabolite of ketogenic diets beta-hydroxybutyrate
freely passes across the blood-brain barrier into the human brain where it is converted to acetyl-CoA. Our data
demonstrate that cholesterol transport is impaired in APOE4 glia leading to intracellular cholesterol accumulation
which triggers inflammation, AD pathogenesis, and cognitive decline. As a compensatory mechanism to impaired
cholesterol trafficking, APOE4 glia upregulates cholesterol biosynthesis, which uses acetyl-CoA to generate
cholesterol. We hypothesize that impaired cholesterol trafficking and upregulation of cholesterol
biosynthesis in APOE4 glia adversely interact with high-fat/ketogenic diets to exacerbate and accelerate
AD pathogenesis. We established methods to mimic ketogenic diets in vitro. This revealed in APOE4 glia
ketones increase aberrant intracellular cholesterol deposits and promote neuroinflammation and
hypomyelination. We developed an in vitro model of human brain tissue that contains all the major cell types and
tissues including cerebrovasculature, neurocircuits, myelination, and neuro-immune cells. Aim 1 will employ this
system (miBrain) to further investigate the interaction of APOE genotype with high-fat/ketogenic diets and its
contribution to AD pathogenesis in human brain tissue. Using transcriptomic and biochemical approaches we
will discover the underlying mechanisms that we will modulate via chemical and genetic approaches to identify
therapeutic targets for promoting beneficial APOE4-diet interactions. We will complement this with studies in
APOE3/3 and APOE4/4 humanized mice in Aim 2 to mechanistically dissect the interaction between APOE
genotype and high-fat/ketogenic diets at the organismal level. Together aims 1 and 2 will provide holistic insight
into the peripheral and central interactions of APOE4 with ketogenic diets. Several other AD risk variants also
have functional roles in cholesterol and lipid homeostasis. We further hypothesize that cholesterol
dysregulation and its interaction with diet is a central pathogenic mechanism of AD. In Aim 3, we will
investigate using isogenic human brain tissue generated from iPSCs harboring genetic risk factors in SORL1,
TREM2, ABCA7, and APOE. We will determine how each risk variant interacts with ketogenic diets to influence
pathogenic outcomes in AD. Collectively, this study will pioneer approaches and technology that will deliver a
detailed molecular understanding of the interactions between genetics, diet, and neurodegeneration opening
avenues to genetically informed therapeutic and diagnostic opportunities."

In this UO1 application, the Medical College of Georgia and Rush Gastroenterology & Neurology Research
Centers propose prospective cross-sectional and longitudinal studies to test the overarching hypothesis that
disruptions in the Gut-Microbiota-Brain-Axis (GMBA) contribute to PD pathogenesis / pathophysiology. We posit
that a comprehensive model, incorporating validated clinical measures and PD relevant pathophysiological
markers of GMBA disruption, will predict disease severity and progression. Aim 1 will evaluate the relationship
between GMBA disruption and PD severity (cross sectional), Aim 2 will evaluate the relationship between the
GMBA and PD progression over 36 months (longitudinal), and Aim 3 is focused on prodromal PD. The GMBA is
multifaceted, and, as such, the global statistical test (GST) approach to examine multiple variables
simultaneously will be used to evaluate the different elements of the GMBA including the gut microbiota, intestinal
barrier, inflammation, resilience, biological aging, and alpha-synuclein pathology. To accomplish these Aims, this
project will leverage an existing Rush sample repository (sample Repository Cohort), a newly recruited group of
subjects (New Cohort), and the resources of the NIDDK Consortium (Consortium Cohort). Outcomes from this
project will reveal the relationship between the GMBA and PD severity and progression which will shed light on
disease mechanism and is expected to define new therapeutic approaches for PD. Our Aim 3 offers the
Consortium an infrastructure to approach the same GMBA modeling for the group’s study of the very earliest
phases of defined disease. For all Aims, this project, in combination with the NIDDK Consortium evaluating the
GMBA in PD, will facilitate the sharing of metadata and samples which is expected to vertically shift the field."
10996763,"The long-term objective of this project is to improve the walking speed and stability of Veterans disabled by
incomplete SCI (iSCI), stroke, or multiple sclerosis sufficiently to safely participate in community activities
outside of the home, and thereby enhance their independence and daily function. We will advance this goal by
implementing the Networked Neuroprosthesis System (NNPS), a fully implanted neuroprosthesis that
stimulates peripheral nerves to augment the actions of selected weak or paralyzed muscles based on real-time
feedback of voluntary body movements. The system is currently under evaluation for hand function in people
with SCI; this overall project would extend the technology to new applications and user-populations. This
Stage 1 proposal will ready the team for a Stage 2 submission. Specifically, we will achieve the following aims:
 1) Verify the pre-clinical test plan for the NNPS. We anticipate that we already completed most of the pre-
 clinical testing as part of a separate prior IDE submission to evaluate the NNPS for hand function after
 SCI. We will confirm the following additional tests: 1) MRI compatibility modeling and testing to identify
 whether NNPS users are allowed to undergo MRI testing. This test will enable people with MS to
 receive the implanted system while continuing routine MRI testing. 2) battery drainage testing to verify
 the remaining time that the system can run to requiring recharge, so that an alert can be incorporated
 into the user interface to provide warnings about time remaining. 3) Additional electrical safety tests that
 are now required since the prior IDE was submitted. Any additional tests that the FDA identifies will be
 added to the Stage 2 pre-clinical test as well. During Stage 1 we will also identify contractors for any
 tests that need to be conducted offsite (e.g. MRI compatibility testing).
 2) Confirm the clinical test plan to evaluate the NNPS in people with partial paralysis for walking. We
 propose a case series where each person serves as their own longitudinal and concurrent control. The
 primary comparison will be walking capability after receiving the implant comparing the device turned
 on relative to walking with the device turned off. Each implant recipient will receive a system
 customized to their unique needs. The system will be tuned and then users will be trained to walk with
 the system at home and in the community to facilitate independent use. During pre-submission
 meetings with the FDA we will confirm the inclusion/exclusion criteria, outcome measures, and risk
 analysis to maximize participant safety and potential benefit.
 3) Prepare for Stage 2 submission and execution. Based on feedback from the FDA, we will revise our
 pre-clinical and clinical testing plans for the Stage 2 submission. At the same time we will identify any
 necessary contractors for tests that must be completed externally or begin developing the test plans for
 internal tests. We will also determine necessary elements for the clinical test plan and any remaining
 human factors and usability testing required prior to IDE submission.
This Stage 1 project is a critical step in moving towards restoring independence for Veterans with paralysis. It
will prepare for a VA Translational Rehabilitation Research Award: Stage 2 and then a subsequent pivotal trial
by determining what the FDA will require and creating the plans for to complete those tests and begin an early
feasibility study. The results will identify potential impact sizes for powering a clinical trial and identify methods
to refine related to implantation, system tuning, and user training. Successful completion of this project will
define a new intervention for Veterans with difficulty walking due to partial paralysis such as stroke, MS, and
iSCI, thus enabling them to be independent ambulators and accelerating their access to life opportunities as
active participants in their communities and society at large."
10996897,"Multiple innate immune mechanisms regulate commensal microbes and promote responses to pathogens.
Identification of non-redundant functions of such mechanisms is not a simple task, especially with regulation of
complex microbial communities such as intestinal commensals. Commensals are indispensable for the existence
of their eukaryotic hosts and provide essential functions) required for the host’s survival. The composition of
microbial communities varies greatly from individual to individual and is shaped by multiple factors including the
mode of transmission during birth, breastfeeding, alimentary infections and diet. An important question remains
unanswered: to what extent and which host’s polymorphic genetic mechanisms are involved in shaping the
repertoire of the commensals. Although many polymorphic genes were found to be good potential contributors to
shaping commensal communities, a drastic difference in expression of defensins alpha (aDef encoded by Defa
genes) was detected between the small intestines of B6 and BALB/c mice. Defensins are anti-microbial
peptides that are thought to safeguard the stem cells of the gut epithelium. Defa genes are localized to a
chromosomal locus that undergoes a rapid evolution and is characterized by multiple duplications and deletions.
In addition, these genes have very high level of homology and there are other defensins with similar functions.
There is no consensus whether aDef have some specificity towards different groups of microbes or whether their
specificities are very broad. Most of specificity suggestions came from the studies of bactericidal effects in vitro
(done with limited variety of Defa-encoded peptides and from the studies of MMP7 KO mice, a metalloprotease
that cleaves aDef peptides to activate them), which by today standards cannot be fully accepted as these studies
did not exclude cage (legacy) effects. Armed with two state of the art approaches – CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing
and germ-free technology – we aim at shedding light on the spectrum of specificities of the aDef peptides, their
contribution to host’s genetic polymorphism in shaping the microbiota and resistance to pathogens.
The current proposal aims at defining the place of aDef in homeostatic and induced by pathogenic signals innate
host defense. Most importantly, it will be done in the most refined and most reliable way.
We will pursue the following specific aims:
Specific Aim 1. Use the combination of reverse genetic and gnotobiotic approaches to study the
homeostatic role of alpha-defensins.
Germ-free mice carrying aDef deletions will be colonized with natural or synthetic microbiomes to detect shifts
in microbiota composition or gene expression dependent on aDef peptides.
Specific Aim 2. Study importance of aDef using infectious and non-infectious stress.
Mice lacking Defa will be tested for sensitivity to infections with intestinal pathogens and chemical insult on the
intestinal epithelium."
10996840,"Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent childhood psychiatric disorders, impacting up to one third of youth.
Pediatric anxiety disorders are highly impairing and, when not effectively addressed in childhood, persist
across the lifespan and predict the onset of additional psychiatric disorders. Up to 50% of youth who receive
the current first-line psychosocial treatment for pediatric anxiety do not sufficiently improve, highlighting the
urgent need to improve treatment response rates. Prior research underscores the critical role of parents in
supporting children’s fear regulation. Across species, parental presence is associated with alterations in key
corticolimbic circuitry associated with fear regulation. In healthy youth, parental modulation of corticolimbic
circuitry is in turn linked with reductions in anxiety. However, youth with anxiety disorders may be at risk for
becoming overly reliant on parents for fear reduction. The vast majority of anxious youth (90%) report relying
on their parent to help regulate their anxiety, and 97% of parents of youth with anxious children report
accommodating their child’s anxiety by engaging in behaviors to reduce their child’s distress. Although
accommodation reduces children’s anxiety in the short-term, it contributes to the maintenance and worsening
of anxiety in the long-term. Supportive Parenting for Anxious Childhood Emotions (SPACE) offers an entirely
parent-based alternative to traditional child-focused treatment that directly addresses parental accommodation
of anxiety and targets parental modulation of their child’s medial prefrontal cortex activation to fearful stimuli.
While SPACE has established efficacy, it is unlikely to be equally effective for all families, and questions remain
regarding which families are likely to benefit most from this targeted intervention. The current multimodal study
aims to identify specific pre-treatment predictors of the efficacy of SPACE as a step towards personalized
treatment for pediatric anxiety disorders. A well-characterized sample of children with anxiety disorders (n=212,
ages 6-12 years) completed an fMRI paradigm assessing youth’s neural reactivity to fearful face stimuli in the
presence versus absence of a parent. A subset of families was then randomized to complete 12 sessions of
SPACE (n=106) as part of an ongoing R61/R33-funded trial. Aim 1 will use a whole-brain approach to identify
neural mechanisms related to parental accommodation of youth’s anxiety pre-treatment. Aim 2 will examine
how pre-treatment individual differences in these neural and behavioral factors relate to changes in anxiety
symptoms following SPACE. Finally, Aim 3 will use connectome-based predictive modeling to predict the
efficacy of SPACE based on pre-treatment patterns of task-based functional connectivity. This study has
important implications for improving our mechanistic and clinical understanding of family-level factors involved
in anxiety. The results of this study could ultimately improve our ability to determine which families would
benefit most from SPACE and thus mark an important step towards personalizing treatment for pediatric
anxiety disorders."

Immunoglobulin E (IgE) binds with high affinity to its receptor, FCeR1, found on the surface of basophils and
mast cells. When an antigen binds to receptor bound IgE, it can lead to IgE receptor cross-linking and
activation of basophils and mast cells. In this case, the antigen is subcategorized as an allergen. Thus, IgE is a
pivotal molecule in the initiation of allergic reaction in a wide range of tissue. The IgE-dependent activation of
basophils leads to the release of granular mediators and, also, to the production of Th2 inflammatory
cytokines, IL4/5/13. Recent work has revealed a novel, allergen independent mechanism by which IgE, bound
to its receptor, can lead to basophil activation resulting in greater IL4/13 production compared to standard IgE-
dependent activation. The mechanism of this allergen-independent activation involves the sugar-binding
protein Galectin-3 (Gal-3), which has been shown to bind directly to IgE. The data reveal that when a Gal-3
bearing cell physically comes into contact with a basophil, it leads to strong basophil activation. However, the
parameters of this interaction remain poorly defined. I hypothesize that Gal-3 interacts with IgE independently
of allergen specificity due to IgE’s variable glycosylation patterns, and that such glycosylation patterns may
differ between allergic and non-allergic subjects. IgE with more N-glycan sugars will interact better with Gal-3
while IgE with more sialic acid will not interact as well. My first aim is to compare Gal-3 with standard IgE-
dependent activation of basophils sensitized by serum from either allergic or non-allergic patients. My second
aim examines the hypothesis that the affinity of Gal-3 for IgE is based on the presence of N-glycan structures
and that this binding can be masked by terminal sialic acid residues. I will treat both whole cells and purified
IgE with glycan modifying enzymes and quantify the Gal-3-induced cytokine production in basophils. My
preliminary data shows that neuraminidase treatment, to remove terminal sialic acid residues, of whole
basophils primed with IL-3 and bearing IgE augments Th2 cytokine production when placed in co-culture with
Gal-3 bearing cells. The results of the study are expected to provide insight into a novel mechanism of allergen
independent IgE activation and should prompt investigation to correlate it with clinical relevance."

 Worldwide, the number of adults over the age of 60 will double to 2.1 billion by 2050, leading to an
enormous rise of age-related, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as dementia, type 2 diabetes, and
cardiovascular diseases. Previous work with small-scale, subsistence-level groups suggests that these
“diseases of aging” may be avoidable and not an inevitable part of getting older. For example, age-matched
samples of Tsimane forager-horticulturalists in Bolivia exhibit the lowest levels of coronary artery disease in the
world and slower brain atrophy than Americans and Europeans. The ability of subsistence-level groups to
“escape” age-related diseases has been hypothesized to be partially driven by differential immune investment
across the life course: these groups are highly physically active, often resource constrained, and constantly
exposed to immune threats–all factors which are predicted to keep the runaway sterile inflammation associated
with many NCDs in check. However, no study to date has used modern ‘omics tools to understand age effects
on immune investment in subsistence-level contexts, or how lifestyle change may directly alter these patterns.
 The central objective of this study is to use a multi-omic approach to understand the effect of lifestyle on
immune activity across aging. Using within and between-population comparisons, I will test how immunological
aging varies between individuals experiencing diverse lifestyles, ranging from traditional subsistence-level to
highly urban lifestyles. To do so, I will work with the Tsimane of Bolivia, the Turkana of Kenya, the Orang Asli of
Malaysia, and with public data generated from US individuals. I will focus on three molecular phenotypes from
peripheral blood that are known to be age-associated in post-industrial contexts–gene expression, DNA
methylation (DNAm), and clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP)–and I will characterize these
features in subsistence-level Tsimane, Turkana, and Orang Asli. I will then explicitly ask how lifestyle variation
impacts patterns of aging and immune function using (i) cross-population comparisons between these
subsistence-level groups and a highly urbanized population (i.e., the US) and (ii) within-population comparisons,
as subsets of the Turkana and Orang Asli have recently moved to urban city centers while others still practice
their traditional pastoralist (Turkana) or hunter-gatherer (Orang Asli) lifestyles. I predict that the energy excess
characteristic of sedentary, calorie dense urban lifestyles will be associated with age-related changes in
somatic mutation rates as well as inflammatory DNAm and gene expression, while in subsistence-level
settings immune variation will primarily track pathogen responses with blunted age effects. Importantly,
I will assess these predictions using both within- and between-population comparisons to reveal robust,
generalizable results. Together, this study will illuminate how urbanization impacts immunological aging typical
of NCDs and will generate extensive ‘omics and health knowledge for historically marginalized groups that are
chronically under-represented in genomic studies."
10996622,"Asthma and COPD are the most commonly diagnosed chronic lung diseases in the United States. Studies have
shown that asthma is the most important risk factor for COPD that develops through a course of low lung function
from school age that tracks into adulthood. However, there is a fundamental gap in understanding the basic
underlying mechanisms of this progression. In the first cycle of funding, we addressed this gap by focusing on
the role of CC16 in mediating the immune response that yields protection against lung function decline. We
published several key reports providing mechanistic and clinical evidence supporting the notion that persistent
early life infections in the context of CC16 deficits may be a previously overlooked link in understanding
progression of asthma into severe asthma with fixed airflow limitation. Additionally, we identified 2 novel ligands
for CC16’s protective activity in different compartments, a4b1(VLA-4) in the circulation and a2b1 (VLA-2) in the
respiratory tract. By engaging with VLA-4 in circulation on activated leukocytes, CC16 limits cellular migration
into the airways and reduces airway hyperresponsiveness. By engaging with VLA-2 on epithelial cells, CC16
promotes antimicrobial and antiviral secretion thereby aiding in host defense against pathogens.
In this renewal application, we will continue these translational studies and test the overall hypothesis that
CC16 protects against Rhinovirus (RV) infection by promoting epithelial-driven antiviral host responses and that
early life infections in the context of low CC16 leads to epigenetic changes resulting in enhanced airway
remodeling. RV is the most common trigger of asthma exacerbations, especially in severe asthmatics and elicits
acute exacerbations. Since CC16 is known to be lower in asthma patients, we will test the hypothesis that
epithelial-driven antiviral host responses are decreased in asthma patient nasal epithelial cell samples via CC16-
dependent mechanisms and that delivery of rCC16 and CC16-derived peptidomimetics offers a therapeutic
benefit by enhancing antiviral host responses, thereby reducing RV infection, and limiting airway remodeling.
This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine mechanisms by which CC16
promotes epithelial-driven host defense against respiratory pathogens, 2) Examine the impact of CC16
deficiency during early life viral infection on lung development and function in adult life and 3) Determine if
circulating CC16 levels and asthma status impact nasal epithelial cell production of antimicrobials and antivirals
and if exogenous CC16 can augment production in a VLA-2 dependent manner."

 An intact epithelial barrier is key for maintaining intestinal homeostasis and preventing inflammation. Barrier
dysfunction has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease and increased susceptibility to enteric
infection. Previous work from the Kuhn lab has demonstrated that IL-6 produced by TCRαβ+ CD4+ colon
intraepithelial lymphocytes (cIELs) are required to maintain epithelial barrier integrity and thus intestinal
homeostasis. In contrast with phenotypically distinct small intestine IELs, which have been widely characterized,
very little is known about cIEL function and development beyond the importance of IL-6 production. This project
aims to define the mechanism that recruits cIELs to and retains them in the epithelium. Preliminary data indicate
that upon exposure to luminal bacteria, myeloid cells produce sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) in a MyD88-
dependent fashion. Conditional knockout of MyD88 in myeloid cells and S1P signaling blockade significantly
reduce the number of TCRαβ+ CD4+ cIELs in the epithelium. However, further experiments are required to
confirm this mechanism and understand the characteristics of recruited cIELs. Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs)
express MHC class II (MHCII) and act as non-professional antigen presenting cells capable of influencing T cell
function independent of local dendritic cells, and conditional knockout of MHCII on IECs changes cIEL effector-
memory ratios. This proposal hypothesizes that intestinal bacteria are recognized by myeloid cells to recruit
commensal reactive cIELs through S1P signaling to the epithelium, where interactions with epithelial MHCII lead
to tolerance. Aim 1 seeks to demonstrate the mechanism by which myeloid cells recruit commensal reactive
cIELs to the colon epithelium. The requirement for cIEL S1P signaling and myeloid cells will be shown by
inhibiting each variable using the S1P receptor 1 inhibitor W146 and CD11c-DTR mice, respectively. cIELs will
be stained for markers of differentiation, antigen experience, and activation. Commensal-reactive cIELs will also
be identified by staining with MHCII-restricted tetramers containing the commensal antigenic peptide Cbir1, and
their TCR Vβ chains will be identified using a flow screening panel. Aim 2 will investigate the mechanism by
which cIELs are recruited to the colon epithelium by utilizing a conditional knockout mouse line in which IECs
are deficient in MHCII (MHCIIΔIEC). Single cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC) sequencing
and bulk T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing will be performed on cIELs from MHCIIΔIEC and MHCIIWT mice. These
experiments will identify how epithelial MHCII influences cIEL gene regulation and TCR repertoire diversity,
respectively. Lastly, MHCIIΔIEC and MHCIIWT mice will be infected with the murine enteric pathogen Citrobacter
rodentium. This experiment will demonstrate the importance of epithelial MHCII in influencing cIELs in the
immune response."

Dental caries is the most prevalent chronic infectious disease, affecting an estimated 2.5 billion people
worldwide. Streptococcus mutans is an important pathogen in dental caries due to its ability to acidify the oral
pH, inhibiting the growth of health-associated non-aciduric bacteria and narrowing the diversity of the oral
microbiota. Candida albicans has emerged as a synergistic partner to S. mutans in dental caries, with the two
organisms being co-isolated from early childhood, root, and dentinal caries. Dual-species S. mutans-C.
albicans biofilms demonstrate enhanced matrix formation, cariogenicity, and stress tolerance including
chlorhexidine and hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide has a more than century-long history of oral use for
its anti-microbial effect. Many oral hygiene products including mouthwashes and toothpastes incorporate
hydrogen peroxide. While hydrogen peroxide has shown to be efficacious as an adjunct in treating
periodontitis, its anti-caries effect is less studied. Interestingly, S. mutans is relatively susceptible to oxidative
stress in comparison to health-associated oral streptococci. However, the enhanced oxidative stress tolerance
of S. mutans in co-culture with C. albicans may reduce hydrogen peroxide's effectiveness as an anti-caries
agent. C. albicans encodes a robust set of oxidative stress tolerance genes. Notably, these include 6
superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes (3 of which are extracellular) and a catalase enzyme, which detoxify
superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and hydrogen peroxide to water, respectively. S. mutans encodes only a
single SOD enzyme. Our working hypothesis is that C. albicans oxidative stress tolerance enzymes, catalase
and extracellular SODs, enhance S. mutans oxidative stress tolerance in S. mutans-C. albicans biofilms. The
goals of this application are to elucidate the mechanism of C. albicans protection of S. mutans oxidative stress
tolerance in vitro and in vivo. To accomplish these goals the PI will utilize biofilm, survival, interruption, and
confocal microscopy assays (Aim 1) and rat caries model (Aim 2) to determine the roles of C. albicans catalase
and extracellular SOD enzymes on S. mutans oxidative stress tolerance and subsequent cariogenicity
Knowledge gained from this study will provide a novel target for disruption of S. mutans-C. albicans synergism
and the highly cariogenic biofilms these organisms produce. Additionally, the comprehensive training plan
provided will further the PI's development to a well-rounded dental researcher through formal coursework,
opportunities to learn new techniques, mentor students, improve scientific presenting and writing skills,
balancing dental practice and research, and networking with other dentists and scientists at conferences."

The standard treatments against other human herpesviruses have limited efficacy against Kaposi’s sarcoma-
associated herpesvirus (KSHV). A mechanistic understanding of KSHV infection and virion production will help
us develop new therapies to limit spread of the virus and thereby prevent the associated diseases, such as
Kaposi’s sarcoma. Viral packaging is an essential, conserved process in herpesviruses and is therefore a
promising therapeutic target. Although the essential proteins and necessary molecular events of packaging are
known, we lack a detailed mechanistic understanding of the process. These knowledge gaps must be addressed
to enable rational drug design. ORF68 is an essential packaging protein of unknown function whose role in this
multi-step packaging process is unknown. Recombinant ORF68 forms a pentamer with a positively central
channel that binds dsDNA in vitro. This work will bridge a critical knowledge gap between these in vitro
observations and ORF68 molecular function during infection in vivo. In Aim 1, I will determine the oligomeric
state of ORF68 during KSHV infection in vivo. In Aim 2, I will determine if the ORF68 oligomerization interface
is required during KSHV infection in vivo. In Aim 3, I will directly assess whether DNA binds inside the ORF68
pentamer channel. This work will unveil the molecular function of ORF68 in the context of infection, bringing us
closer to a mechanistic model of KSHV packaging."

A counterbalance to RNA synthesis, RNA degradation is critical for regulating gene expression. The
understanding that RNA degradation is critical for gene expression traces back to 1959 when Pardee, Jacob and
Monod demonstrated in a historical paper that there had to be an unstable intermediate directing protein
synthesis. Groundbreaking research over the past decades led to the identification of a variety of specific and
tightly regulated RNA decay pathways and biochemical characterization of the enzymes involved in them, both
in eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. The clinical applications in the post-transcriptional regulation/RNA field
are now being realized with the initial development of Nusinersen/Spinraza® to successfully treat Spinal
Muscular Atrophy and the more recent description of Milasin® to treat a single patient through a personalized
RNA therapy. Of course, in 2020, RNA burst onto the global stage in a way we could not have predicted with the
COVID-19 RNA virus impacting life as we know it across the globe. Who would or could have guessed that RNA
could also represent a potential path back to a new normal via the rapid development and deployment of the first
mRNA vaccines. All these examples highlight why the FASEB meeting on ‘Mechanisms of RNA Decay’ is timely.
This meeting has developed into a unique conference that brings together the leading experts in RNA decay in
humans and other metazoan animals, plants, fungi, viruses, and bacteria. This meeting is the 13th is a series of
FASEB meetings on this topic where there is a long tradition of sharing key discoveries, building collaborations,
and contributing to career development for junior scientists in the field. This meeting, held August 18–22, 2024
in Lisbon, Portugal, is co-organized by three leaders in the RNA decay field, Dr. Olivia Rissland from University
of Colorado School of Medicine, USA, Dr. Alicia Bicknell from Moderna Therapeutics, and Dr. Oliver Muhlemann
from University of Bern, Switzerland. We propose three specific aims for this meeting: 1) Bringing together the
international community working on RNA degradation and providing an intellectually stimulating and mutually
supportive forum for the presentation and discussion of the latest advances in the field; 2) Providing an inclusive
and friendly environment for establishing collaborations between researchers studying RNA degradation with
different approaches and in different organisms; and 3) Encouraging productive interactions between a diverse
group of both junior scientists and world leaders in the RNA degradation field. In keeping with the meeting goals,
the organizers are committed to inclusive excellence: Among the 28 invited speakers, there are 13 women (46%)
and a well-balanced gender ratio will be ensured among the 25 additional oral presentations that will be selected
from the submitted abstracts. Also, among the 10 session chairs, six are women. We are excited to include
trainee co-chairs, who will be selected from the short-talk presenters. The long-term goal is to continue a
successful meeting series that addresses modern and timely topics in RNA decay and strengthens the
interactions within a diverse and inclusive community of collaborative scientists and colleagues."
11003999,"SUMMARY OF PARENT GRANT:
Regeneration is a remarkable phenomenon that is both ubiquitous and mysterious; although many different
animals are capable of replacing damaged and/or lost structures, it is unclear how these regenerative species
maintain both the cellular stability required for tissue integrity and the cellular plasticity needed to reactivate
tissue development upon injury. Moreover, as regeneration is often induced by spontaneous and imprecise
tissue damage, how do cells translate broad and sudden signals into cell-type-specific transcriptional changes?
 Genomic regulators such as transcription factors and chromatin-modifying enzymes work together to
instruct cell fate during developmental processes. Although there is substantial data describing how these
factors orchestrate embryogenesis, much less is known about how they are activated to induce regeneration.
My central hypothesis is that chromatin serves as a mediator between the signaling events that are triggered
by significant tissue loss and the cellular changes they induce to activate regeneration. To uncover the
fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying this process, my laboratory studies the planarian model of
animal regeneration. Planarians are free-living flatworms with incredible regenerative capacities. They are also
amenable to genetic perturbation through RNAi, easily dissociated for single cell analyses, and encode
chromatin modifying proteins with strong homology to those in other organisms. We are particularly interested
in how some planarian cell types respond to injury by activating specific, essential, regeneration genes, while
others activate an entirely different set of loci in response to the same injury. My lab uses multiple customized
methods to isolate specific planarian cell types, both differentiated and stem cells, in order to characterize the
chromatin state of these cell types before and after injury. We also leverage data showing that RNAi depletion
of the MLL1/2 chromatin enzyme in the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea leads to loss of cilia on its outer
epithelium. In addition, we have recently isolated and characterized a new planarian species that has a unique
cilia pattern on its outer epithelium, providing an exciting opportunity to use comparative genomic approaches
to identify specific genes that are linked to this particular trait. Combining all these approaches, we aim to
dissect the functional role and molecular signaling cues contributed by specific cell types during regeneration.
 The outer epithelium and other differentiated tissues are essential for planarian regeneration in large part
because they signal to a population of heterogeneous multi and pluripotent stem cells that are maintained in
adult planarians. Because these stem cells must differentiate into all needed cell types in response to missing
tissue signals, it is not surprising that they are highly plastic and transcriptionally heterogeneous. Yet it is
unknown how they create and maintain this heterogeneity in vivo. We will test the hypothesis that a conserved
chromatin signature regulates this critical feature. These studies will uncover important mechanisms underlying
both regeneration and other biological processes that require dynamic gene regulation across complex tissues.
SUMMARY OF PROPOSED RESEARCH FOR CANDIDATE:
A growing body of research in the planarian field supports the hypothesis that longitudinal muscle fibers
secrete signaling proteins that are required for the regeneration of new tissues. However, these papers largely
do not address the role of muscle contraction in this process. Nonetheless, it is known that muscle contraction
is induced immediately after injury and required for wound closure. In my lab, we are interested in how
signaling events triggered by injury lead to changes in gene expression that are required for regeneration. We
hypothesize that the muscle contraction triggered by a significant injury induces the activation of essential
tissue patterning genes. We are using chemical inhibitors, RNA interference, and physiological measurements
to test our hypothesis.
 This project has been the focus of a talented undergraduate student in my laboratory, Easter Kabuya,
who graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology in December 2023. We are requesting funds to
support her as a post-baccalaureate researcher in the laboratory so that she can complete her ongoing project,
assemble it into a first author publication, and enhance her competitiveness as an applicant to M.D./Ph.D.
programs as well as future fellowships and grants. The completion of this project will not only further the career
of this candidate, but also the objectives of the parent grant by connecting injury-induced changes in a specific
tissue type with functional changes in gene expression during regeneration."

Rumination is a transdiagnostic risk factor for developing depression and anxiety in
adolescents. Rumination reflects compromised inhibitory control capability and is fundamentally
a maladaptive psychological process in response to stressors. Understanding the neural
correlates of rumination and inhibitory control enriches our knowledge on the neural and
cognitive propensity for rumination, thereby informing the design of effective clinical programs
for the prevention and treatment of adolescent mental health issues. To achieve the objectives
of identifying neural features associated with trait rumination and inhibitory control capabilities,
the proposed project will analyze the multimodal data from the parent R01 including anatomical
MRI, resting state fMRI, the severity and temporal dynamics of trait rumination measured via
Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA), and performance profiles from a Sustained
Attention to Response Task (SART). Voxelwise-based morphometry (VBM) will be used to
obtain voxelwise estimate of gray matter density. Algorithms for calculating the Amplitudes of
Low Frequency Fluctuation (ALFF) from the resting state fMRI data will be utilized to obtain
voxelwise ALFF maps. Resting State Functional Connectivity (RSFC) analyses will be
conducted using Regions of Interest (ROI) including subgenual prefrontal cortex, left amygdala
and Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC). Voxelwise maps of gray matter density, ALFF and RSFC
will be used for linear regression analyses with EMA and SART metrics as regressors to identify
significant clusters after false discovery rate correction. Based on existing knowledge on the
neurobiology of rumination and inhibitory control, we hypothesize trait rumination to be
significantly associated with the gray matter density of the Dorsal Lateral Prefrontal Cortex
(DLPFC), the ALFF values of the medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus and
subgenual cingulate cortex, as well as the RSFC between the subgenual prefrontal cortex and
Default Mode Network (DMN); we also hypothesize SART commission errors (incorrect
response to “no-go” trials) and frequencies of task-unrelated thoughts during SART probe trials
to be associated with the gray matter density at DLPFC and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex as
well as the RSFC between DMN, frontal-parietal network and salience network. Finally, the MRI
metrics of the significant clusters identified above will be entered into Machine Learning (ML)
processes to predict depression severity as measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies
Depression (CESD) scale scores. The ML processes include data-driven feature selection and
cross-validation steps to quantitatively evaluate the predictive power of these neural features."

Our long-term objective is to fill the unmet need for treatments for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Caveolin-1 is
a promising therapeutic target in fibrotic diseases. The profibrotic effects of caveolin-1 deficiency in cells and in
mouse models is suppressed by a peptide equivalent to its active site (caveolin-1 scaffolding domain, CSD).
We demonstrated the beneficial effects of CSD using model systems for lung, skin, heart, and kidney fibrosis.
CSD almost completely suppressed the dramatic increases in fibrosis, vascular leakage, and inflammatory cell
infiltration and the deficits in organ function occuring in these models. Similar aging-associated pathological
changes also occur in the heart and kidneys of otherwise untreated 18-month-old mice and were reversed by
CSD. Thus, CSD reverses pathological changes even when they are established prior to treatment initiation.
However, CSD lacks key pharmacologic properties for drug development. Therefore, we undertook a rational
series of steps (devising CSD fragments, making the fragments water soluble, comparing fragment efficacy) to
select a Lead Compound (W94-101). These studies were performed by s.c. delivery; however, we recently
determined that oral delivery can be just as beneficial. Our Lead Compound selection and demonstration of
oral efficacy puts us in a strong position to successfully perform these logical next steps in developing our Lead
Compound as a CKD treatment. 1) Determine the Therapeutic Index of the Lead Compound (toxic dose to
therapeutic dose ratio). We will determine the dose-dependence of the beneficial effects of daily oral delivery of
the Lead Compound in angiotensin II (AngII)-induced kidney disease and the dose-dependence of the toxicity
(if any) associated with treating healthy mice with Lead Compound daily at high doses. Success will be defined
as a Therapeutic Index >25. Readouts in the beneficial effect studies both in Aims 1 & 2 will be kidney function
(albuminuria, BUN, creatinine, glomerular filtration rate), fibrosis/tissue morphology (analyzed by Western blot
and IHC), and vascular leakage. 2) Further Validate the Lead Compound: Second Model System, Scrambled
Lead Compound, Comparison to Drug Used to Treat Kidney Fibrosis, Less Frequent Dosing, Therapeutic
Protocol. Two mouse model systems will be used: AngII Infusion and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO)
surgery. These models are complementary because in the AngII model glomeruli are most affected, while in
the UUO model the tubulo-interstitium is most affected. In each model we will compare daily oral administration
of the Lead Compound with daily oral administration of scrambled Lead; daily oral administration of the drug
finerenone; and less frequent Lead Compound administration. We will also determine whether the Lead
Compound is efficacious when its administration is initiated only after AngII-induced disease is already well-
established (Therapeutic Protocol). We will consider these studies to be a success if the Lead Compound
inhibits the pathological effects of AngII and UUO on kidney function, fibrosis, and vascular leakage by >50%."
11006033,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cardiometabolic disease (CMD), which includes cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and stroke, is
the number-one cause of death in the world. Drugs currently used to treat CMDs by lowering LDL-C, such as
statins and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, are either not completely effective,
have numerous side effects, are very expensive, or are delivered by injection. In addition, these drugs do not
reduce the incidence of T2D and insulin resistance. Thus, there is a critical need for new therapies that treat the
various conditions of CMD and that address the shortcomings of current treatments. Secretion of gut hormones
in response to nutrient ingestion is critical for the proper management of lipids, glucose, and appetite; however,
gut hormone responses are impaired in patients with hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and obesity.
BioKier is developing the first orally administered therapeutic, BKR-017, that restores gut hormone secretion in
the colon of patients with CMD. The active ingredient is butyrate, one of the most important natural activators of
gut hormone release. BioKier’s approach is to improve the delivery of butyrate to the active site of gut hormone
secretion, the colon, and thus improve gut hormone secretion in conditions of CMD. This approach is a significant
advance on the use of other formulations of butyrate that do not specifically target the colon and on injectable
GLP-1 analogs that have efficacy but also have dose-limiting side effects. BKR-017 is designed to address
deficiencies in gut hormone secretion, improve cardiometabolic conditions, and, due to its novel mechanism of
action, complement the actions of existing therapies.
The overall aim of this Phase I project is to demonstrate the safety of BKR-017 in a Phase 1 clinical trial. Safety
in Phase 1 is the first step in the clinical development of novel drugs under an IND. Successful completion of this
Phase I SBIR project will position BKR-017 for a Phase II SBIR application in which we plan to propose a Phase
2 clinical trial to investigate the efficacy of BKR-017 in lowering LDL-C levels in subjects with elevated LDL-C
and the associated risk of cardiovascular events. Pilot studies by BioKier indicated that BKR-017 significantly
reduced total cholesterol, LDL-C, non-HDL-C, apolipoproteins, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMOA), and fatty liver
biomarkers, which are all indicators of increased cardiovascular risk. However, these studies were conducted in
subjects selected for T2D but not for hyperlipidemia. These results suggest that BKR-017 will have even more
significant effects in hypercholesterolemia patients, many of whom cannot lower their LDL-C to safe levels with
statin use alone.
Development of BKR-017 along the path of prescription drug approval will significantly increase the value of the
drug and its appeal to large corporate partners who have the capacity to commercialize it. BioKier has
commissioned a market analysis that indicates that there is a large and growing market for new drugs that are
effective in patients who are resistant to, or unwilling to use, statins. Other options are not widely accepted
because of cost, inconvenient administration, and/or side effects."

Obesity is a complex disease that disrupts hormonal and metabolic pathways, increasing the risk of chronic co-
morbidities like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Obesity itself afflicts more than 1 billion globally
and, when combined with its associated risk factors, contributes to over $480 billion in direct annual healthcare
spending. Roux en Y Gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) leverages duodenal nutrient exclusion (DNE) to achieve
best-in-class weight loss results; however, the high costs, extensive procedural risks, and limited reimbursement
have greatly limited access to care. Further, pharmacotherapies and weight loss devices have failed to strike a
balance between affordability and efficacy, which has both limited adoption and widened socioeconomic access
disparities. As such, there is a pressing need to develop novel weight loss interventions that can achieve best-
in-class results while maintaining attractive safety and cost profiles. Using technology licensed from MIT, Syntis
Bio has created a gastrointestinal synthetic epithelial lining (GSEL) that is administered orally and leverages
endogenous enzymes to form a robust muco-adhesive coating specific to the duodenal epithelium. When co-
formulated with cross-linking nanoparticles, GSEL creates a semi-permeable barrier capable of blocking nutrient
absorption (GSEL-Barrier). The goal of this proposed project is to create a once-daily oral pill that blocks nutrient
absorption in the duodenum, thereby mimicking the effects of RYGB. Thus far, GSEL-Barrier has demonstrated
the ability to reduce glucose absorption by 70% in pigs when challenged with an oral glucose tolerance test
(OGTT). In this Fast-Track SBIR proposal, we seek to expand on this this early pig work to further optimize GSEL
composition for barrier formation, engineer GSEL into solid tablet formulations, and test efficacy in beagles which
more closely reflect human gastric emptying times. Successful completion of these aims will yield optimized solid
dosage form tablets that have been validated in large animals and are ready for first-in-human testing. Syntis
will then be ready to start scaling GMP manufacturing as well as initiate GLP pre-IDE studies in preparation for
first-in-human trials."

Leading to over 270,000 deaths in the US annually, septicemia is the systemic inflammatory response to a
bloodstream infection (BSI). Studies have shown that early detection and the administration of appropriate
antimicrobial treatment for BSIs are crucial for proper patient management and lead to improved patient
outcomes and reduced hospitalization times. However, the current diagnostic standard of care relies on blood
culture, which is not only slow, requiring ~1-3 days to return a positive result, but also demonstrates reduced
sensitivity in the presence of antimicrobial treatment. Consequently, there is a substantial demand for innovative
diagnostic approaches that eliminate the need for blood culture and deliver faster and more accurate results.
To address this unmet need, HelixBind developed RaPID/BSI, a fully automated sample-to-answer test which
identifies BSIs directly from blood in four hours, without cultures. Implemented on the RaPID (Resistance and
Pathogen IDentification) platform and appropriate for placement throughout the hospital, RaPID/BSI
incorporates a broad test menu of 20 bacterial and fungal pathogens and, crucially, is not compromised by prior
antimicrobial treatment. Species level detail is provided with single CFUs/ml sensitivity, enabling selection of
appropriate antimicrobials. Commercialization of RaPID/BSI will provide timely characterization of BSIs,
enabling intervention with targeted antimicrobials. This is expected to result in improved patient outcomes and
a reduction in the use of unnecessary antimicrobials, slowing the rise of antimicrobial resistance. Reflecting
RaPID/BSI’s significant advantages over exiting diagnostic standards and the potential to markedly improve
care and quality of life, the FDA designated RaPID/BSI a Breakthrough Technology.
In this proposed Phase II project, HelixBind will complete verification and validation activities necessary to
prepare our submission to the FDA for regulatory clearance. This work includes improvements to the external
control material to be provided with the system along with completion of analytical and clinical studies, as
reviewed with the FDA. Upon successful completion of this project, we will file for regulatory clearance for
RaPID/BSI and bring this breakthrough device to market."

The goal of this project is to develop a novel synthetic biology-based cellular medicine that leverages natural
microbiome pathways to inhibit gut inflammatory processes for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD). Over 3 million adults in the U.S. suffer from IBD, an umbrella term encompassing two chronic
inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract: Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)1. IBD is
typically diagnosed in the second or third decades of life, is life-long, and there is no cure. Current IBD
treatments can have serious side-effects, and patients become refractory. Novel therapies that are safe and
effective, particularly restoring the intestinal membrane barrier, are needed and would be life changing.
Intestinal immune regulatory signals tightly govern healthy gut homeostasis, and their breakdown may result in
IBD40. The human microbiome, harboring trillions of bacteria, is a critical regulator of these mechanisms.
Commensal bacteria function to maintain intestinal epithelial barrier integrity and regulate innate and adaptive
immune cell function41. Surface layer proteins (Slps), including SlpA, SlpB, SlpX, and lipoteichoic acid (LTA)
interact with pattern recognition receptors (PRR) expressed on innate immune intestinal cells to fine immunity
in steady state and diseased conditions42-45. Our research team demonstrated that SlpA is the predominant
anti-inflammatory Slp signal. SlpA binds to the C-type lectin Specific Intracellular adhesion molecule-3
Grabbing Non-integrin homolog-Related 3 (SIGNR3) receptor expressed on dendritic cells lining the gut
prevents experimentally induced colitis in multiple models15. Oral delivery of SlpA via L. lactis (also known as
R-3750 or R110) reduced inflammatory cytokines, strengthened the mucosal membrane barrier, and supported
a healthier microbiota make-up in animal models of gut inflammation20. Notably, the effects and protection
mediated by SlpA were not observed in Signr3-/- mice, suggesting that SlpA interaction with SIGNR3 plays a
key protective role in regulating the disease condition15. New data from our Phase 1 clinical trial in patients
suffering from ulcerative colitis (NCT05666960) showed that R-3750 was safe and yielded promising biomarker
data and clinical outcome results demonstrating clinical proof-of-concept.
Our goal is to develop R-3750, a synthetic biology engineered SlpA-expressing Lactococcus (L.) lactis strain,
as a novel, orally administered drug that functions as immune therapy to reduce gut inflammation, improve
gastrointestinal mucosal barrier function, and restore the natural microbiome make-up in IBD patients. This
CRP application is intended to build upon our prior product development success and advance R-3750 into
Phase 2 clinical testing. The specific aims are: 1) establish 250L scale GMP manufacturing infrastructure, 2)
develop 250L scale process for R-3750 clinical manufacturing, 3) perform clinical GMP manufacturing of R-
3750 Drug Substance, 4) prepare Drug Product for distribution to clinical sites, and 5) obtain FDA regulatory
approval to start a Phase 2 clinical trial."

Project Summary
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is the most common form of inflammatory bowel disease affecting up to one in 5,000
individuals. The pathologic inflammation occurs in the inner lining of the colon and rectum due to an inappropriate
response of resident leukocytes to normally tolerated bacteria and other pro-inflammatory material in the gut.
This results in potentially life-threatening ulcerative lesions and significant disruption to quality of life. Currently
indicated small molecule and biologic drugs are not effective in all patients, or many patients become
unresponsive to therapies over time, and additional treatment options are needed. One promising and novel
therapeutic approach to controlling UC is to restrict anti-inflammatory drug action to the inner lining of the gut
where the local inflammatory response is most extreme, thereby simultaneously limiting systemic anti-
inflammatory side effects of the drug. An orally available drug with such gut-restricted properties would be acting
similarly to topical agents applied to the skin to control autoimmune inflammation of the skin. The leukocyte Ca2+
release activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channel is operative on gut monocytes and T cells (primary cellular drivers of
UC), is triggered by leukocyte receptors for foreign antigens, and the CRAC pathway regulates many pro-
inflammatory genes in these cells through activation of NFAT and NF-B transcriptional activity. These attributes
make the CRAC channel a suitable target for development of a gut-restricted small molecule drug.
Vivreon’s candidate therapeutic CRAC channel blocker exhibits physical properties consistent with a gut
restricted oral drug candidate, including strong potency and limited systemic exposure upon oral dosing. Vivreon
seeks NIAID Phase 2 funding for investigational new drug (IND)-enabling good laboratory practice (GLP) toxicity,
safety, and genotoxicity studies. Specifically, NCI funding will go towards two-species GLP 28-day toxicity
studies, GLP safety pharmacology and genetic toxicology, GLP pharmacological respiratory safety assessment,
and GLP cardiovascular telemetry. Activities in this proposal will run in parallel with chemistry manufacturing and
controls (CMC) processes. Completion of these studies will support and be written up in an IND application, with
the final milestone being IND submission to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)."
11007625,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH, formerly NASH) is a liver disease characterized by
the unnatural accumulation of lipids within hepatic cells, inflammation, and ultimately fibrosis. It is frequently
connected to obesity and estimated to affect up to 5% of adults in the U.S., and despite huge investments by
the pharmaceutical industry, there are not (yet) any FDA-approved drugs for MASH. Anti-inflammatory
compounds are relatively under investigated for this disease, and may have the potential to minimize the
dangerous liver fibrosis that occurs as MASH progresses.
This project will investigate a novel approach to the treatment of MASH: the induction of anti-inflammatory
signals in liver tissue via biased small molecule modulators of protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), called
parmodulins. Published and unpublished results using wild-type and PAR1-modified mice fed high-fat diets
(HFD) suggest that inflammatory effects of MASH are lessened with a natural activator of PAR1, activated
protein C (APC), and also by compounds that can block the inflammatory signaling initiated by the activation of
PAR1 by thrombin (i.e., thromboinflammation). In this project, we will test the ability of orally-active
parmodulins to produce protective effects in mice by tipping the balance of PAR1 signaling in liver tissue from
a pro-inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory phenotype.
In Aim 1, novel parmodulins will be synthesized that have been designed to lack the potential to generate toxic
metabolites, and which may possess improved potency at PAR1. In Aim 2, these compounds will be tested in
cellular models of PAR1 signaling and inflammation, and promising examples will be studied in a series of
standard drug-like profiling assays, including cytotoxicity, solubility, plasma and metabolic stability, and off-
target activity. In Aim 3, select parmodulins will undergo PK studies, and representative examples will progress
to a mouse model of advanced MASH in the lab of co-investigator Dr. James Luyendyk (Michigan State Univ.).
Mice with a high fat, high cholesterol, and high sugar diet will be dosed with carbon tetrachloride to induce an
advanced form of MASH with significant fibrosis. Mice will then be treated with parmodulins at high and low
doses to determine their ability to inhibit a range of measures of liver injury, steatosis, inflammation, and
fibrosis. It is anticipated that parmodulins will have minimal bleeding risks relative to certain thrombin inhibitors
and PAR1 antagonists, and this will be supported with a guinea pig hemostasis study.
Successful results in these studies will justify the completion of lead optimization and the future preclinical
development of parmodulins for the treatment of MASH and potentially other liver diseases."

We propose to develop an undergraduate research program that promotes the advancement of students from
underrepresented (UR) groups in the field of addiction research: the Training in Research Undergraduate
Experience through the Rutgers Addiction Research Center, the “TRUE RARC” Scholar Program. The lack of
diversity among addiction scientists is associated with real opportunity costs, from hindered scientific
innovation to persistent disparities in outcomes of substance use treatment for diverse populations.
Undergraduate research programs are necessary to remedy underrepresentation, as they build a bridge to
advanced STEM degrees by helping students envision a future career in research, learn foundational research
skills, and build competencies and self-efficacy. Rutgers is an ideal environment in which to build an
undergraduate addiction research training program. As The State University of New Jersey, Rutgers enrolls
>45K undergraduates across three campuses, each of which ranks highly in diversity and social mobility for
low-income students. Further, Rutgers is home to the largest comprehensive addiction research center in the
United States, consisting of >150 researchers representing more than 40 departments and schools, that
closely coordinates with Rutgers Health, which provides substance use services across the state of New
Jersey. The specific aims of our proposal for the TRUE RARC Scholar Program are: (Aim 1) Develop an
innovative three course sequence (Data Science & Addiction Research 1 & 2, followed by a Capstone course)
to teach students about the foundations of addiction research and data science methods, culminating in a
digital badge representing measured competencies. Our course sequence will make use of the Adolescent
Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study data, introducing students to a hallmark NIH resource, while
teaching them about interdisciplinary addiction research, including genetics, neuroscience, and social/
environmental influences on substance use outcomes. (Aim 2) Upon completion of their foundational
coursework, engage 10 or more students from underrepresented backgrounds in six-month, mentored
research experiences in RARC faculty labs, culminating in a research presentation at the annual RARC
symposium. (Aim 3) Provide professional development opportunities for career readiness and graduate school
matriculation by collaborating with our robust network of academic, industry, state, and health care partners.
(4) Create a national resource for addiction research education by building a web repository to publicly
disseminate core aspects from our proposed program, and that of other RARC-affiliated and NIDA/NIAAA-
sponsored training programs, including coursework and professional development content. This will expand
the impact of our undergraduate training program beyond the Rutgers campuses. In summary, our program will
build an undergraduate pipeline into a range of graduate programs, and create associated resources for the
field, to significantly remedy underrepresentation among addiction scientists."

Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection worldwide, and public
health measures including test-and-treat strategies have been ineffective at curbing incidence and prevalence.
As a consequence, Ct pelvic inflammatory disease and sequelae of ectopic pregnancies and infertility continue
to be important medical issues. Currently there is no therapy that prevents PID-associated infertility. The central
hypotheses of the grant based on Chlamydia muridarum (Cm) mouse model data is that selective TNFR2
blockade will prevent chlamydia PID associated immunopathology and infertility. Enabling this investigation are
a humanized inhibitory anti-human TNFR2 monoclonal antibody developed by the Johnson lab and a new
humanized TNFα/TNFR1/TNFR2 (hTNF) mouse model developed by Biocytogen. Aim #1: To establish a hTNF
mouse breeding colony and compare Cm bacterial shedding and immunopathology scores in hTNF mice with
wild type C57BL/6 mice bred in the same facility. Aim #2: Use gene synthesis technology to rapidly generate
subclass variants of the successfully humanized rat anti-human TNFR2 26C09 monoclonal antibody to
investigate their inhibitory activity in human PBMC activation assays and determine efficacy of mouse
equivalents for preventing immunopathology in the Cm-hTNF mouse model."
10986540,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) exerts a significant clinical and financial burden worldwide. OSCC
continues to have poor prognosis despite advances in treatment modalities including surgery, radiotherapy and
immunotherapy, highlighting the urgent need for development of novel therapeutic strategies for this deadly
disease. Recently, there has been increasing interest in the role of the microbiome in OSCC. Extensive
research—including studies by Dr. Al-Hebshi—has shown OSCC to be associated with a distinct microbiome.
However, mechanistic in vitro and animal studies have almost exclusively focused on exploring of the role of
tumor-associated species (i.e. the pathobionts) while overlooking the potentially protective role health-associated
species could play in oral carcinogenesis. Indeed, there is growing evidence to support the use of natural and
engineered bacteria as anti-tumor agents. Additionally, studies have found the microbiome to modulate response
to cancer immunotherapy. However, such studies in the context of oral microbiome and oral cancer are lacking.
Our overarching goal is to identify oral bacterial species with anti-cancer properties and exploit them for
prevention or/and treatment of OSCC. Our central hypothesis, supported by preliminary data, is that health-
associated oral bacteria can interfere with OSCC tumor development and progression by inducing cytotoxicity
in cancer cells, inhibiting proliferation, downregulating CD36, and/or modulating the microbiome. We also
hypothesize that health-associated oral bacteria activate antitumor immunity, which in turn can enhance efficacy
of immunotherapy. To address these hypotheses, we propose the following Specific Aims: Aim 1 To assess
effect of S. mitis and H. parainfluenzae on development of chemically-induced OSCC in vivo (Prevention setting);
Aim 2 To study the ability of these species to modify the response of chemically-induced OSCC to checkpoint
inhibitor immunotherapy (Adjunctive therapy setting). We will employ a range of technologies including digital
imaging, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, q-PCR, fluorescent in-situ hybridization and
16S and RNA sequencing to investigate the effect of treating 4-NQO mice with the test species. The proposed
studies explore for the first time the novel concept of using health-associated bacteria as anticancer and
immunomodulatory agents in OSCC. These studies have high potential for translational impact in OSCC.
Given the accessibility of the oral cavity, local delivery of bacterial species with anti-cancer properties via gel,
mouthwash, or lozenge may be used in human subjects as a new paradigm for OSCC prevention and/or as
adjunctive therapy. An additional strength of our approach is that it employs health-associated bacteria, that are
unlikely to be cleared by the immune system or to induce adverse effects."
10983619,"The NLRP3 inflammasome is a key regulator of inflammatory responses. These include responses to
infection by pathogens but also are a component of many chronic inflammatory diseases, including
neurodegenerative diseases. The end point of the inflammasome response is the secretion of mature
inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β and IL-18. To accomplish this, the NLRP3 inflammasome is assembled and
activated through a complex series of events, some of which remain poorly understood. The first step in
NLRP3 inflammasome activation is the de novo biosynthesis of NLRP3 itself through transcriptional
upregulation, and the assembly or newly synthesized NLRP3 molecules into inactive oligomers. How this
occurs is only partially understood. We have evidence that the ubiquitin ligase SCFFBXW7 is required for this
particular process. The objective of the proposed research is to test a hypothesis where SCFFBXW7 places
ubiquitin chains on the N-terminal end of NLRP3 which are bound and capped by a UIM (ubiquitin interacting
motif) near the C-terminus. The constraints enforced by this interaction would lock NLRP3 in a conformation
that would promote the assembly of inactive oligomers."
10984399,"Lewy body dementia (LBD) is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer’s disease. In particular, Parkinson’s Disease (PD) progression has been associated with LBD and cognitive decline in a number of cognitive domains including executive function, attention, processing speed, episodic memory, and visuospatial processing. The predominant clinical motor features of PD are bradykinesia, resting tremor, and muscular rigidity; however, the prevalence and severity of the nonmotor effects of PD have significant detrimental effects on quality of life. While conventional pharmacological and surgical treatments of PD are effective in improving motor symptoms of PD, they do not improve cognitive deficits and may even have long-term deleterious effects on verbal fluency and cognition. 
Chronic high frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) is efficacious for improving motor symptoms of PD. Current stimulation parameters are optimized for motor benefit, with frequencies in the high gamma (100-180 Hz) range. Interestingly, increased low frequency oscillations (i.e. theta rhythms (4-8 Hz)) have been implicated in a range of cognitive functions, including spatial and episodic learning and memory. There is growing evidence that low (theta) frequency STN stimulation preferentially improves executive function compared to standard-of-care gamma DBS (cDBS). Indeed, we have generated data in PD patients with STN DBS that indicate “on” theta stimulation improves hippocampal-based verbal fluency compared to “off” or “on” gamma stimulation. Unfortunately, low frequency (theta or beta; 5-30 Hz) stimulation is not beneficial for motor symptoms. However, recent advances in stimulation programming allows for theta burst stimulation, which integrates high frequency (gamma 50-200 Hz; trains of 5-25) bursts of stimulation repeated at theta (5-10 Hz) frequency intervals. This theta burst stimulation increases theta oscillation activity. Moreover, there is evidence that STN theta burst stimulation is not only safe, but also has comparable motor outcomes compared to conventional gamma frequency STN DBS. 
Overall Goal: In light of our recent findings that theta stimulation improves cognitive function in PD patients with STN DBS, we hypothesize that chronic theta burst stimulation will confer a long-term cognitive benefit while concomitantly maintaining the motor benefits of gamma stimulation. The proposed randomized double-blind phase 2 clinical trial will focus on determining if 1) short-term and 2) chronic theta burst STN stimulation will improve both cognitive and motor measures; and 3) determining if theta-burst DBS and cDBS result in differing acute and chronic functional brain connectivity. The interpretation of data from this research will improve understanding of the acute and chronic effects of theta burst DBS on cognition and motor function. If successful, this study has the potential to develop a novel STN stimulation paradigm to treat both motor and cognitive PD symptoms as well as understand the effects of theta burst DBS compared to gamma DBS on fMRI functional connectivity measures. As this study is aimed at modulating cognitive networks, the ultimate goal is to develop novel stimulation parameters to treat chronic cognitive dysfunction in PD dementia and more broadly Lewy body dementia. Moreover, data collected, and collaborations developed will lay the foundation for a definitive Phase 3 clinical trial utilizing theta-burst stimulation for cognition and motor symptom improvement."

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is the most common muscular dystrophy seen in children, which affects
both muscle and bone. To date, the mechanisms that contribute to the poor skeletal health in DMD are not fully
understood and no targeted therapies exist to slow or halt the progression of osteoporosis and related fractures.
We have identified a novel bone-regulating myokine, FGF-21, which is typically not expressed in skeletal muscle
under physiological conditions, is dramatically increased in dystrophic skeletal muscles in DMD mouse models.
However, the mechanisms which drive FGF21 expression in dystrophic muscle and the pathological role of
FGF21 on bone metabolism in DMD are not clear, representing a significant gap in knowledge. The purpose of
this proposal is to identify the cellular source of elevated FGF21, determine the molecular mechanism(s) that
drive FGF21 expression, and to characterize the pathological effects of muscle-derived FGF21 on bone in DMD.
The cellular and molecular mechanisms of upregulated FGF21 expression will be determined in skeletal muscle
of dystrophic mouse models. The pathological role of muscle-derived FGF21 on skeletal muscle, bone and
whole-body metabolism will be determined by skeletal muscle conditional FGF21 knock out animals and in in
vitro cell models. Completion of these studies will not only provide understanding of the pathogenesis of DMD
skeletal abnormalities but also elucidate a novel muscle/bone crosstalk signaling pathway mediated via myokine
FGF21. The proposed studies will provide the groundwork for developing potential therapies targeting FGF21
signaling to manage poor bone health in DMD patients."

 Systemic sclerosis (SSc) or scleroderma is a chronic multisystem autoimmune disorder. The underlying
pathophysiology includes innate/adaptive immune system abnormalities, endothelial injury with small vessel
vasculopathy, and fibroblast activation with subsequent fibrosis. Digital ischemia/digital loss is a feared
complication of SSc. Prospective studies report that an estimated 50% of patients with SSc experience digital
ulcerations over 5 years of follow-up, and 20% experience finger amputation secondary to ischemia. The
currently available clinical tools for the assessment and monitoring of the underlying pathophysiology
(vasculopathy, tissue ischemia and fibrosis) are only semi-quantitative. The dearth of quantitative tools to
evaluate potential treatments has resulted in patients with SSc enduring significant morbidity.
 Here we propose to use multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with SSc for a
comprehensive quantitative assessment of vasculopathy, tissue hypoxia, and fibrosis in the hands, which
contributes the most to patient disability in SSc. In Aim 1, we will test quantitative MRI biomarkers to complement
established clinical assessments of vasculopathy, ischemia, and fibrosis. In SubAim1a, we will test whether
quantitative MRI physiologic biomarkers correlate with clinical assessment of vasculopathy, ischemia, and
fibrosis. In SubAim1b, we will determine the association between MRI physiological biomarkers and vascular
symptoms and complications (digital ulcers and digital loss). In Aim 2, we will test whether short-term changes
in quantitative MRI biomarkers can predict long-term changes (12 and 24 months) in symptoms and vascular
complications. Collectively, this work will provide new noninvasive imaging biomarkers to inform prevention and
treatment interventions and to monitor effectiveness of therapy for digital ischemia.
 Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus
erythematosus. Peripheral vascular disease is the leading cause of disability in SSc. The applicant’s long-term
goal is to become a leader in cardiovascular imaging in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases. The
applicant is already an expert in cardiac imaging. Now, formal training in peripheral vascular imaging is
necessary. We propose a focused, intense career development training plan which will include 1) mentorship
from a team of experts led by the primary mentor, an expert in peripheral vascular imaging, 2) advanced didactic
coursework on peripheral vascular imaging, quantitative image analysis and machine learning, and 3) hands-on
experience with peripheral MRI techniques (guided by an expert MRI physicist, co-mentor) and quantitative
image analysis with integration of machine learning (guided by expert image analysis/machine learning advisor).
The proposed work will center on an established cohort of clinically well characterized SSc patients, but the skill
sets obtained will be broadly applicable. At this award’s conclusion, the candidate will emerge as an expert in
peripheral vascular imaging in rheumatic diseases and be poised to assume the role of independent investigator."

This proposed Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) will provide Samuel
Gentle, MD, with the mentorship, training, and research experience needed in his transition towards an
independent clinician scientist and leader in the field of bronchopulmonary associated pulmonary
hypertension (BPD-PH). Over the course of his career, Dr. Gentle aims to reduce morbidity and mortality in
children with BPD-PH, a disease in which 50% of children die by 2 years of age and nearly half of survivors
have continuation of disease into adulthood. This commitment therefore directly aligns with the mission of
the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to prevent and treat heart and lung disorders so that individuals
live longer and more fulfilling lives. Dr. Gentle will accomplish this career goal through novel translational
and interventional investigations and future multi-center clinical trials of therapeutic strategies that reduce
adverse outcomes in infants with BPD-PH. In order to further facilitate these accomplishments, Dr. Gentle’s
complimentary and comprehensive mentorship and advisory team provides a group of investigators with a
rich history of NIH funded investigations and prior mentorship; formal training inclusive of a (1) Master of
Science in Public Health in Biostatistics, (2) completion of a graduate certificate in Medical Signal and Image
Analysis, and (3) echocardiographic assessment of BPD-PH; and a research strategy that is an intentional
extension of his ongoing research in infants with BPD-PH. Dr. Gentle has recently produced multiple high
impact publications in AJRCCM including an investigation of intermittent hypoxemia characteristics related
to BPD-PH thereby providing a surrogate metric to evaluate therapeutic responses to BPD-PH interventions
including those in the current proposal’s SA2 and SA3. These characteristics, in addition to demographic
and clinical characteristics detailed in Dr. Gentle’s additional publication in AJRCCM, provide the framework
for BPD-PH risk estimation as detailed in SA1. In summary, the current proposal addresses the minimal
evidence for (1) prediction of BPD-PH in extremely preterm infants (SA1), (2) characterizing subphenotypes
of infants with BPD-PH using group trajectory modeling (SA2), and (3) oxygen saturation targets that reduce
echocardiographic BPD-PH by performing a randomized, crossover trial in infants with established BPD-PH
randomized to oxygen saturations of 92-95% and 95-98% (SA3). Insights from these investigations will
strengthen the currently expert consensus-based recommendations from the American Thoracic Society and
American Heart Association in the optimal oxygen saturation targets and pulmonary hypertension specific
pharmacotherapies used to treat children with BP-PH. Subsequent R01 funded multi-center clinical trials will
provide consequential evidence that will influence standards of care in children with this disease."

Summary
Non-invasive, quantitative assessment of coronary atherosclerosis will lead to improved, personalized patient
management for the leading cause of death in the US — cardiovascular disease. Detecting high-risk lesions at
the earliest stages of coronary artery disease would facilitate timely medical interventions to hinder the pro-
gression of coronary atherosclerosis and prevent catastrophic complications. Intravascular imaging modalities
such as intravascular optical coherence tomography (IVOCT) have been used to identify the presence and
characteristics of coronary atherosclerosis. IVOCT, with its high resolution and contrast, is recognized as the
best method for identifying local high-risk lesions (e.g., thin cap fibroatheroma). However, intravascular imag-
ing is invasive, limiting its applicability, especially for patients early in the disease process. Coronary computed
tomography angiography (CCTA) is the only non-invasive imaging modality allowing the assessment of luminal
stenosis as well as plaque morphology. We will develop new AI methods for CCTA evaluations of high-risk
coronary atherosclerotic plaque by comparing them to concurrently-acquired, high-resolution/contrast IVOCT,
deemed the best method to assess high-risk plaque. To enable a new, non-invasive evaluation of atheroscle-
rosis, we will register CCTA images to concurrently-acquired IVOCT images and determine image features in
CCTA that associate with and predict high-risk plaques as seen in IVOCT. In addition to this concurrent deter-
mination of high-risk plaque in CCTA, we will take what we learn and apply it to the long-term prediction of ma-
jor adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Specifically, we will: 1) Create highly automated methods for as-
sessing high-risk plaques seen microscopically in IVOCT and develop CCTA feature candidates suggestive of
high-risk plaque; 2) Use novel IVOCT to CCTA registration to associate segmental CCTA features to IVOCT-
defined high-risk plaque features and to create a CCTA classification model for high-risk plaque; and 3) Apply
the most promising segmental CCTA features to predict long-term adverse outcomes in CCTA data. With suc-
cess, our research will lead to decision support software for the prediction of MACE, facilitating revasculariza-
tion strategies, therapeutic decisions, and furthering precision medicine approaches. The project team will build
on expertise in cardiology, machine learning, biostatistics, and advanced image analysis of IVOCT and CCTA.
 In this project, I will build upon my experience in machine/deep learning analysis of intravascular images to
include new training in image analytics of CCTA data, biostatistics, and bioinformatics of metabolomics and
genomics, providing me with a foundation for a future career in cardiovascular disease. For example, I will be
well situated to integrate CCTA image analytics and genomics to further my understanding of cardiovascular
disease. Importantly, I will explore issues in cardiovascular disease and expand my network to include premi-
ere cardiologists who can help me understand new issues and formulate hypotheses for future studies."
10984629,"Understanding human mobility is critical to achieving malaria elimination. This is particularly important in regions
such as the Amazon, which has the goal of eliminating malaria by 2030, and where declining incidence rates are
leading cases to become increasingly clustered into networks of villages that are connected due to human
mobility and other environmental factors. These networks and villages are therefore at risk of malaria importation.
However, efforts to understand how human mobility contributes to importation and diffusion are either incomplete
or ill-suited to the Amazon context. For example, while mobile phone data have been used to track mobility in a
number of settings, coverage is nonexistent in the rural Amazon, and is otherwise unable to capture the many
different reasons people travel. Other approaches in the region have leveraged GPS tracking or individual-level,
participatory mapping approaches, which cannot be easily scaled to collect data across an entire region to
identify metacommunities or quantify mobility within and between them. Moreover, none of these approaches
are able to track parasite populations. However, the molecular studies that do so are either cost-prohibitive or
have insufficient coverage of the malaria genome to inform about importation in increasingly low transmission
settings. Finally, all of these studies ignore the crucial role that community network ties have on human mobility
and, by extension, malaria parasite structure and importation. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to
effectively link scalable and actionable network and molecular tools to understand the ways in which human
mobility contributes to malaria population structure, importation, and diffusion in the northern Peruvian Amazon.
Aim 1 of this proposal focuses on collecting primary community network data to: 1) quantify human mobility
patterns, including drivers of mobility and seasonal variability, 2) identify networks of villages based on mobility
patterns, and 3) quantify the effects of mobility on malaria transmission. Aim 2 will link these community network
data with genomic surveillance of malaria parasites to: 1) identify how network structure contributes to malaria
population structure, and 2) identify source and sink communities of malaria transmission, and 3) quantify the
effect of different types of human mobility on malaria importation both between villages and between networks
of villages. The overarching hypothesis is that network structure is a fundamental driver of malaria population
structure, while human mobility within and between networks drives importation and diffusion. This proposal will
make significant contributions to ongoing malaria surveillance and control in the region, and be conducted in
collaboration with Peru’s Malaria Zero program, which his tasked with eliminating malaria in the region."
10984777,"Project Summary/Abstract
Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s disease, constitute one of
the greatest challenges in modern therapeutic development due to an inadequate understanding of the
interplay of pro- and anti-apoptotic feedback mechanisms operative in the progression of these diseases. This
inadequate understanding is in part due to a lack of practical (crosses blood-brain-barrier, well-studied
mechanism of action) biochemical tools to modulate and effect related cellular processes, such as neurotrophic
responses (pro-survival, pro-growth, and pro-differentation responses), and metal ion homeostasis levels,
which are both significantly perturbed in neurodegenerative contexts.
 The Williams lab and Epp lab propose to evaluate the mechanism and pathological impacts of a non-peptide
small molecule, called trans-banglene (t-BG), which has demonstrated neurotrophic effects in cell culture,
primary neurons and mouse models of neurodegeneration, is orally bioavailable, and also has recently been
shown by the Williams lab to alter iron-binding proteins in PC 12 cells. This combined impact on neurotrophic
responses and iron homeostasis makes t-BG well suited to provide insight into the interplay between these two
cellular response mechanisms. However, a cellular target and mechanism of action is not yet known for t-BG.
 The following proposal outlines work to 1) identify the cell recognition/binding partner and localization upon
binding, 2) characterize t-BG treatment impacts on known neurotrophic signal transduction pathways, iron
localization, and lipid oxidation profile in cells and tissues and 3) to evaluate impacts on neuronal morphology,
plasticity and neurogenesis in AD mouse models. The interdisciplinary setting of the Williams lab enables both
synthetic access to derivatives of this molecular scaffold as well as cell response data from biochemical assays
of their activity. The Epp lab will concurrently validate mechanistic impacts in hAPOE4 knock-in mouse tissues
and measure changes in neurogenesis/neuron structure.
 Importantly, these mechanistic studies will improve understanding of the differential drivers of neurotrophic
effects and iron homeostasis. Once mechanism of action is determined, and validated in mouse models, this
orally bioavailable molecular tool can be broadly employed in the biomedical community to study inhibition of
neurodegenerative disease progression, helping to create the foundation for new medicinal strategies. Further,
once a cellular target is established, future work will use structural information regarding binding mode to inform
optimization studies that increase potency and drug-like characteristics for t-BG, improving its utility and
facilitating drug development investigations."

Cognitive decline with aging, including Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), is a public health
imperative that impacts quality of life and disability. Survivors of acute surgical or medical illness contribute
greatly to the crisis of cognitive decline. Hospitalization confers a 1.5-2-fold increase in the odds of new onset
dementia. Surgery is common in older adults, but it (and its resulting hospitalization) is associated with
significant cognitive decline. Individual interventions to reduce this decline have exhibited limited success. The
COgnitive and Physical Exercise to improve Outcomes after Surgery (COPE-iOS) study is evaluating a
program of cognitive and physical training throughout the perioperative period. The intervention consists of
adaptive computerized cognitive training plus guided aerobic exercise sessions, whereas the active attention
control consists of a non-adaptive control computer game and guided stretching sessions. Comprising both
prehabilitation and rehabilitation, the two study arms participate in activities for at least 2 weeks prior to surgery
and for 3 months after discharge and involve significant weekly interaction with our study team. The study
assesses global cognition, disability, depression, and mechanistic pathways. Multiple additional factors,
including social support, may influence postoperative recovery, and organized support groups empower
patients are associated with improved outcomes after surgery. Throughout the COPE-iOS study, participants in
both arms consistently engage with a core team of personnel and sessions are group-based, allowing
participants to engage with and support one another. This design provides a much higher level of interaction
with providers and peers facing similar circumstances than standard perioperative care. While the active
attention control design is essential to the COPE-iOS study to evaluate the efficacy of the cognitive and
physical exercise program, the active attention control may confer more benefit to patients than previously
anticipated. The Investigating Functional Outcomes and Cognition thrU Surgery (InFOCUS) study is a
prospective observational cohort measuring cognitive and physical outcomes after major surgery in older
adults who are receiving usual care. The primary hypothesis of this proposal is that outcomes in usual care will
be worse than both a combined cognitive and physical exercise program and an active attention control
program with regard to global cognition (Aim 1) and disabilities and depression (Aim 2). The InFOCUS study
will enroll 125 patients ≥60 years old awaiting major inpatient surgery and assess global cognition, activities of
daily living, and depression at baseline and at 3 and 12 months after discharge to allow better understanding of
the efficacy of the combined cognitive and physical exercise program and further our knowledge on potential
contributions of enhanced systemic support around major surgery to improve outcomes when compared to
usual care."

To survive, living organisms must collect information about their environment and use it to select appropriate
behaviors. However, information from the environment is often noisy, incomplete and ambiguous. Currently,
no theory or model comprehensively explains how nervous systems solve the problem of navigation based
on noisy information. Without such a theory, we cannot improve the ability of living systems or autonomous
machines to make better decisions by processing the imperfect sensory information that is typically available
to them.
We propose to build a complete data-driven model of how nervous systems turn noisy sensory information
into action selection during navigation. We have previously been able to decipher aspects of this process by
studying the Drosophila melanogaster larva — a small, transparent organism that is exceptionally good at
navigating towards food odors despite having only 10,000 neurons. My lab has developed methods to
rigorously quantify odor landscapes; measure how neurons represent these odors; automatically track larval
movement; create virtual sensory realities for the larva; and change the real-time behavior of the larva on-
demand with optogenetics. We have also recently mapped an entire pathway within the larval nervous
system. Here, we will determine how and when noisy sensory information causes the larva to reorient (stop
and turn) as it is navigating towards an attractive odor source (chemotaxis). Our objective is to uncover the
neural mechanisms that accumulate, filter, and process noisy sensory evidence and use ambiguous
information to make coherent perceptual decisions (action selection). By combining theory, experiments,
and modeling, we will iteratively build a quantitative model which predicts the cellular and circuit-level
computations transforming sensory (olfactory) signals into navigational decision-making (chemotaxis) that is
robust to environmental disturbances (noise)."

Deadly lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, lung injury, constrictive
bronchiolitis, and pulmonary fibrosis affect >300 million people worldwide and cause ~3 million annual deaths.
Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic and the lingering effects of Long COVID have exacerbated lung disease
morbidity and mortality. Indeed, despite the vast morbidity and mortality of lung diseases, there is currently no
widespread clinical imaging modality to perform high-resolution functional lung imaging: CT, conventional MRI,
and chest X-ray generally only provide structural images of dense tissues—informing about pathologies like
tumors and pneumonia—but yielding little information about lung ventilation, perfusion, alveoli size, gas-
exchange efficiency, etc. This state of affairs contrasts with cancer imaging, which includes MRI, CT, ultrasound,
mammography, Positron Emission Tomography, which collectively enable early detection, diagnoses, and
monitoring response to treatment. Pulmonary functional MRI using hyperpolarized Xenon-129 gas was FDA
approved in December 2022 because it enables 3D imaging of lung function on a single breath hold and reports
on regional lung ventilation, diffusion, and gas exchange. Despite effectiveness and safety of hyperpolarized
Xenon-129 gas MRI to diagnose a wide range of lung diseases, widespread clinical adaptation of this imaging
modality faces major translational challenges, including the high cost and complexity of the equipment for
production of hyperpolarized Xenon-129 gas. The central and most expensive component (and frequent point of
failure) of a xenon-129 hyperpolarizer device is the high-power laser diode array (LDA) that provides the resonant
light used to polarize the xenon-129 spins. Current xenon-129 hyperpolarizers employ lasers with ~0.3-nm
bandwidths; although a significant improvement from the multi-nanometer linewidths of previous un-narrowed
LDAs, it is still several-fold wider than the intrinsic linewidths of atomic absorption lines. This mismatch often
results in most of the laser light being wasted. Next-generation lasers have recently become available that can
provide unprecedented control of the LDA bandwidth down to ~0.02 nm – an order-of-magnitude improvement
over current-generation systems. This advance allows the laser output to be matched to the narrow atomic
absorption lines, potentially enabling the Xenon-129 hyperpolarization efficiency to be improved by several fold!
If successful, this innovation should lead to the development of substantially more efficient and easier-to-site
hyperpolarization instrumentation for clinical-scale production of hyperpolarized Xenon-129 contrast agent.
Here, we propose to explore and characterize the Xenon-129 hyperpolarization performance of this next-
generation laser technology. We will investigate the utility of tunable laser bandwidth – in addition to tunable
wavelength and laser power – for increasing the overall efficiency of our commercialized clinical-scale
hyperpolarizer device, with the long-term goal of improving the biomedical community’s access to hyperpolarized
Xenon-129 gas contrast agent for functional pulmonary imaging."

Thus, our team developed, implemented and evaluated a school clinician training and ADHD/ODD intervention (i.e., the Collaborative Life Skills [CLS] program) for Mexico: a setting with high unmet need. We integrated technology into our in-person program (CLS-FUERTE) to create a digitally-enahnced version (CLS-R-FUERTE). Given findings demonstrating feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of both program versions, we propose a Type 2 Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation Design to evaluate the program effectiveness, mechanisms of intervention change, and maintenance barriers/facilitators in a scaled-up cluster randomized controlled trial with n = 40 schools across two Mexican -while also- exploring the impact of an implementation strategy in which we adapt the program to fit each school’s needs/resources during the maintenance period to encourage sustainability (i.e., CLS-A-FUERTE). Our implementation process is guided by the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment (EPIS) model with evaluation following the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) Framework. 
Aim 1) Test the effectiveness and implementation of the CLS-A-FUERTE school clinician training and ADHD/ODD intervention program adapted for schools across Mexico. We expect:
H1) School clinicians will engage in training and implement chosen intervention components with fidelity
H2) Teachers and/or families will engage in chosen intervention components and adhere to the strategies
H3) Students receiving CLS-A-FUERTE will show greater improvement in ADHD/ODD symptom and impairment severity (rated by parents/teachers) compared to students receiving school services as usual 
Aim 2) Evaluate mechanisms of sustained intervention change. We expect:
H4) Improvements in parenting behaviors will mediate sustained intervention effects 
H5) Improvements in teacher and/or school clinician competency will mediate intervention effects
Aim 3) Identify CLS-A-FUERTE maintenance barriers and facilitators. We expect across adaptations that sustained intervention effects and continuation of program activities at follow-up will relate to: 
H6) Program feasibility (i.e., cost estimates) and acceptability (i.e., participant satisfaction)
H7) Characteristics of participating schools and school context factors
Aim 4) Expand research capacity to a novel university setting. We expect emerging investigators will:
H8) Complete clinical research coursework and produce deliverables (i.e., presentations, papers, grants)
H9) Show improved EBT skills, research capacity and culture ratings, and competency as program trainers"

State of the art methods for the early detection and monitoring of cancer are either invasive, time-consuming,
expensive, or frequently inaccurate, which hinders the routine screening of at risk-patients to improve survival
rates. The multiplexed detection of oncometabolites circulating in minimally or non-invasive biofluids, such as
saliva, blood plasma, or sweat, could provide significant clinical and economic benefits. Metabolites and related
circulating biomarkers are structurally unique elements with distinctive absorptive fingerprints in the infrared (IR)
portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Common approaches that provide multiplexed metabolite detection,
such as mass spectrometry (MS), Raman spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy,
are expensive and difficult to miniaturize. On the other hand, inexpensive miniaturized electrochemical techniques
lack specificity, sensitivity, ease, and suffer from limited multiplexing. Portable technologies capable of rapid and
accurate diagnostics of early/late-stage cancer are not readily available.
To address this challenge, our multidisciplinary team proposes an innovative Neural Network Enabled Cancer
Spectroscopy (NNECS) liquid biopsy platform based on plasmonic nano-micro electromechanical systems
(NMEMS) to diagnose and monitor early/late-stage head neck cancer (HNC). Instead of targeting individual
metabolites, we propose to process the entire IR spectrum of saliva, blood plasma, and sweat as a biomarker.
Our focus is head and neck cancer (HNC), a highly metabolic disease where stratification of patients according
to better diagnostic information would greatly improve outcomes. Our platform combines IR NMEMS sensors to
accurately detect IR spectral fingerprints with neural network (NN) frameworks to find the appropriate
combinations of spectral bands that will inform the design of highly multiplexed miniaturized biosensor.
We will take a novel, interdisciplinary approach within the framework of five key components: (i) collecting and
analyzing (FTIR, MS, histopathology/imaging) biofluids (saliva, sweat, blood) from a large number of early/late
stage HNC patients and healthy subjects per year; (ii) developing powerful NN architectures and diagnosis tools
for segregating early/late-stage HNC samples from controls, considering IR data streams from each individual
biofluid as well as their potential combinations; (iii) developing a NNECS platform using arrays of plasmonic
NMEMS targeting specific IR bands resolved by ML algorithms; (iv) determining NNECS early/late-stage cancer
detection performance in terms of specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy; and (v) elucidating which metabolites
drive the changes in the IR absorption of cancer biofluids supported by MS. The expected outcome is a
miniaturized, label-free, affordable, and accurate technology able to radically improve the ability to diagnose early-
stage HNC as well as the monitoring of recurrent HNC patients. Moving beyond, NNECS can be adapted for the
diagnosis and monitoring of a wide range of metabolic conditions, including many types of cancer, diabetes, and
heart-diseases."

Conference Type: Research Training, Infrastructure and Career Development
PROJECT SUMMARY
The importance of having physicians who share diverse characteristics with their patients, such as racial and
ethnic background, religion or gender, is rooted in several factors that contribute to the overall quality of
healthcare and patient outcomes. While it's essential to note that the quality of care is not solely determined by
the diversity of the physician, diverse representation in the healthcare workforce can have positive
impacts for several reasons, including: cultural competence, enhanced communication, increased trust and
reduced health disparities. In Emergency Medicine (EM) specifically, there is a great need to increase the
diversity of trained physicians and researchers to adequately represent the population of patients seen in
emergency departments across the nation. Particularly, the creation of a diverse and sustainable
Emergency Medicine investigator pipeline will support the advancement of health services research in
EM, building a strong network of clinician scientists who have the relevant background, training and
support to conduct high quality research representative of the diverse population of patients seen in
the emergency department (ED).
The Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM) is a professional association serving over 8,400
emergency care providers with an interest in academics. The SAEM Annual Meeting (SAEM24) is the premier
forum for original research and innovative education in academic EM. This year, the SAEM24 Consensus
Conference aims to address the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s (AHRQ) strong and continued
interest in achieving equity in healthcare delivery in the United States by bringing together hundreds of key
stakeholders to develop a comprehensive program aimed at creating a sustainable and diverse pipeline of
federally-funded clinician-scientists in the specialty of EM. The conference will be held May 14, 2024 in
Phoenix, Arizona at SAEM’s 35th annual meeting. The scope of the plan will include identifying and prioritizing
evidence-based strategies and tactics that specifically focus on undergraduate and medical student training,
resident and fellow training, early career faculty and mid-career faculty training. It's important to recognize that
while physician diversity is valuable, it is just one aspect of a broader strategy to improve healthcare outcomes
for all patients. Other critical factors include improving access to care, addressing systemic barriers, and
promoting cultural competence training for healthcare providers of all backgrounds. The outcomes of the
SAEM24 Consensus Conference will address these factors and create a national plan for research training,
infrastructure and career development for the future. The proceedings of the conference along with the plan
will be submitted for publication and widely disseminated through SAEM’s national communication channels,
creating the opportunity for stakeholders to take meaningful action to improve current practices."

In individuals with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, epilepsy surgery can often reduce or eliminate seizures by
resection or ablation of regions responsible for seizure generation, or epileptogenic zones (EZs). Successful
epilepsy surgery depends critically on accurate and complete localization of these EZs. Current clinical strategies
for EZ localization include noninvasive presurgical evaluation, plus invasive intracranial monitoring with stereo-
SEEG (SEEG) in over 50% of cases. However, 33-50% of patients continue to suffer from disabling seizures
after surgery, as traditional presurgical testing does not consider the connectivity of presumed EZs to other brain
regions. We hypothesize that true EZs are network nodes with abnormal and identifiable connectivity patterns,
and brain network connectivity measurements may supplement standard clinical testing to guide EZ localization.
Here we propose innovative, multimodal studies incorporating structural and functional MRI connectivity
measures, resting-state and seizure (ictal) SEEG recordings, and electrically-stimulated cortico-cortical evoked
potentials (CCEPs) to help guide surgical decisions and localize “true” EZs using network connectivity. In Aim 1,
we will develop a novel supervised machine-learning approach using whole-brain MRI structural connectivity to
identify epilepsy subtypes and predict surgical outcomes. These measures may guide initial surgical decisions,
and help patients avoid intracranial monitoring when it is not necessary. In Aim 2, we will use a combination of
resting-state and ictal SEEG as well as CCEPs to define connectivity fingerprints of true EZs, which we
hypothesize will demonstrate increased inward (inhibitory) connectivity at rest but increased outward (excitatory)
connectivity at seizure onset (the Interictal Suppression Hypothesis). Using these measures, we will create a
combined SEEG connectivity model to supplement traditional ictal interpretation and improve EZ localization. In
Aim 3, we will relate SEEG and functional MRI connectivity measures to each other using penalized regression,
aligning brain states during both modalities using simultaneous scalp EEG. This will allow us to identify
noninvasive functional MRI network measures for EZ localization that are validated by SEEG in the same
patients. Our multimodal network approaches will use both electrophysiology and neuroimaging connectivity
measures, combining invasive and noninvasive techniques, to ultimately aid accurate EZ localization and guide
surgical decisions. Overall, our goal is to develop novel and innovative network measures that can be applied
broadly using existing hardware at surgical centers to improve patient care in drug-resistant focal epilepsy."

One of the main research directions of my laboratory focuses on regulation of the endothelial barrier and
endothelial cell migration. These processes are critical for physiological function of vascular system and they
are often dysregulated in human diseases. A lot of progress has been made in understanding signaling that
regulates endothelial barrier and cell migration. However, stimulation of endothelial cell migration during
angiogenesis is a highly localized and transient event. Defining the role of the local and temporal components
of angiogenic signaling has been challenging due to limitations of current tools. Furthermore, spatiotemporal
regulation of the endothelial barrier by these stimuli has been poorly understood. Our proposed work will focus
on determining how the location and duration of migratory signals direct endothelial cell invasion and migration
through extracellular matrix, and how they affect the organization and permeability of the endothelial barrier.
The endothelial barrier is controlled at the level of adherens junctions (AJs), cell-cell adhesion structures
mediated by the transmembrane protein VE-cadherin. Phosphorylation-mediated signaling regulates the
structure and permeability of AJs. In our recent studies, we described a dual role of tyrosine kinase Src and its
phosphorylation of VE-cadherin in regulation of endothelial permeability. Our results demonstrated that Src-
mediated phosphorylation induces formation of dynamic AJs that still retain their barrier function. This suggests
a mechanism for the regulation of AJ plasticity that does not compromise barrier permeability during
endothelial cell migration. In parallel studies, we dissected a mechanism of Src-regulated degradation of the
extracellular matrix by the endothelial cell and discovered a novel cytoskeletal component that mediates
formation of matrix-degrading podosomes. The studies proposed here will continue to build on our previous
findings and focus on dissecting how phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and angiogenic signaling by Vascular
Growth Factor Receptor 2 (VEGFR2), Sphingosine-1-phosphate Receptor 1 (S1PR1), and Src regulate
plasticity of AJs as well as invasion and migration of endothelial cells. We will employ novel optogenetic tools
that will allow us to interrogate these processes with precise spatial and temporal control. We will use
engineered light-regulated VEGFR2, S1PR1, and Src to determine the effects of locally and temporally
controlled angiogenic signals and dissect mechanisms that mediate regulation of AJs and migration of
endothelial cells in three dimensional environment. Our long-term goal is to define the processes that control
migration of endothelial cells and endothelial barrier function during angiogenesis."
11084210,"Project Summary/Abstract
At Magnetic Tides we developed a radically new NIBS approach, one in which subthreshold modulation of neural
excitability is brought about via oscillating magnetic fields at kilohertz frequencies. This system, referred to kTMP
(kilohertz Transcranial Magnetic Perturbation) significantly increases the range of subthreshold E-field induction,
and through modulation of the envelope of the kHz carrier frequency, can impose E-fields at physiological
relevant frequencies. In the parent grant, the initial experiments are conceived to test tolerability and efficacy of
kTMP in healthy participants, leading to behavioral experiments which focus on improving motor skills with kTMP.
The goal of the supplement research project is to test the impact of amplitude-modulated kTMP (AM-kTMP) on
a language task by targeting physiologically relevant frequencies to manipulate brain oscillations and speech
perception. These results could have important consequences for the use of AM-kTMP as an intervention in the
treatment of receptive aphasia. In parallel, the supplementee will help to test and validate our hypotheses about
the needs of motor and language rehabilitation practitioners and center with regard to our novel neurological
treatment. She will help target market segments and create value propositions with these customers. This aim
will include customer discovery and business model hypothesis testing focused on building a scalable business
model by talking to customers, partners, and competitors.
The supplementee intends to apply to medical school to become a neurosurgeon. At this stage in her career her
main goal is to gain a solid foundation in cognitive neuroscience and to be exposed as much as possible to the
neurological rehabilitation setting. By the time her appointment ends, she will have acquired the core skills
necessary to carry out an independent research project. She will also have a thorough awareness of the field of
rehabilitation on many different levels, from the clinical aspect to the broader biomedical/health technology
landscape."
