 The goal of this grant proposal is to advance the preclinical development of a novel macrocyclic peptide,
Orynotide™ MTD12813, for treatment of multidrug resistant (MDR) Gram negative bacterial infections, with the
initial focus being on infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). The emergence of
infections by multiple CRE pathogens has created an urgent public health threat, because carbapenems are
drugs of last resort for infections caused by an increasing fraction of MDR bacterial pathogens. Just two species,
Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, cause an estimated 140,000 nosocomial infections per year in the
United States alone, and many are carbapenem resistant. There is global consensus that new preventive and
therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to combat the growing problem of MDR bacterial infections. The
applicants, leaders in the field of θ-defensin biology, are responding to this need by developing Orynotides, a
new class of host-directed antimicrobial macrocyclic peptides bioinspired by the structural and biological
properties of theta (θ)-defensins, macrocyclic peptides expressed exclusively in Old World monkeys (but not
humans). Exploiting the pleiotropic host defense properties of θ-defensins, we produced a library of novel
Orynotides that includes several compounds that are highly effective in MDR Gram negative septicemia models.
Hit-to-lead studies identified MTD12813 as the lead Orynotide candidate for preclinical development as a first-
in-class immunotherapeutic agent for MDR Gram negative infections. In the mouse peritoneal sepsis model,
single dose administration of MTD12813 is highly effective (enhanced survival with concomitant bacterial
clearance) against multiple strains of CRE-K. pneumoniae and CRE-E. coli, and additionally was shown to be
effective in septicemia caused by MDR Acinetobacter baumannii. Consistent with the range of pathogens
against which MTD12813 is active in vivo, we showed that the peptide’s mode of action is immunotherapeutic,
promoting host-mediated bacterial clearance, stimulating phagocytosis and neutrophil recruitment, while
modulating levels of otherwise dysregulated proinflammatory cytokines. These data indicate that MTD12813 is
a novel immunotherapeutic agent effective in the treatment of Gram negative bacterial pathogens. The peptide
is readily manufacturable ( ~1.5 g on hand), highly stable in human plasma and whole blood, resistant to bacterial
proteases, and well tolerated when administered by numerous routes. In the proposed studies, we will advance
the preclinical characterization of MTD12813. Aim 1 studies will include production of GLP MTD12813 and other
critical reagents, pharmacokinetic (PK) and PK/pharmacodynamic analyses, and ADME studies. Aim 2 will focus
on illuminating mechanism(s) of action at the cellular and molecular level. Aim 3 objectives will include preclinical
non-GLP safety and toxicokinetic studies in rats and beagle dogs, evaluation of immunogenicity, development
of an antidrug antibody assay, and culminate with formal GLP safety studies. The goal of these aims is to
advance the preclinical development of MTD12813 to IND filing with the FDA."

One of the major challenges limiting the potential of genomic medicine to revolutionize clinical care is the
current lack of knowledge about the function of most human genetic variants. Consequently, the majority of
clinically encountered genetic variants are classiﬁed as variants of uncertain signiﬁcance (VUS), which cannot
be used for clinical decision making given their unknown relationship to disease. The VUS problem is
particularly acute for individuals from populations historically excluded from research, compounding existing
healthcare inequities when implementing genomic medicine.
Variant-level functional data has the potential to overcome many of these challenges by providing pathogenicity
information for variants from diverse populations. For example, we and others have demonstrated that
multiplexed assays of variant effect (MAVEs) can resolve a large fraction of VUS in clinically important genes
(e.g., 49% of BRCA1 VUS, 69% of TP53 VUS, and 93% of DDX3X VUS), and several U.S. and international
consortia are currently using MAVEs to produce functional data for all possible coding and non-coding variants
associated with all genes that have been linked to human disease. Given the potential of functional information
to augment the implementation of genomic medicine, clinical guidelines have recently been updated to
recommend the use of variant-level functional data when interpreting variant pathogenicity. However, despite
the potential clinical utility of large-scale functional datasets, how best to implement them such that clinicians
can appropriately incorporate variant functional data into clinical practice remains unknown.
In this proposal we aim to address this unmet need in genomic medicine using the following approach:
 ● First, we will generate a framework for standardizing and disseminating curated large-scale functional
 data into clinician-facing resources, and implement this framework into ClinVar (Aim 1)
 ● Second, we will perform a proof-of-concept integration of variant level functional data in ClinVar into two
 large clinical practices to evaluate the clinical uptake and impact of variant-level functional data (Aim 2).
 ● Finally, we will build and disseminate resources for training clinicians on best practices for integrating
 functional data into clinical practice (Aim 3).
Overall, this proposal has the potential to significantly advance the implementation of genomic data into clinical
practice by enabling clinicians to appropriately leverage emerging variant-level functional data to resolve VUS,
thereby making genomic medicine more equitable and impactful."

 Pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ib (PHP1B), a rare disorder, is caused by abnormal
imprinting of differentially methylated regions (DMR) on the maternal GNAS allele during oocyte
maturation, thereby reducing expression of the α-subunit of the stimulatory G protein (Gαs).
Autosomal dominant PHP1B (AD-PHP1B) variants can be caused either by deletions, inversions,
or duplications within the STX16/GNAS locus, but most PHP1B patients are sporadic
(sporPHP1B) and their molecular defects remain unresolved, except for those cases affected by
paternal uniparental disomy (patUPD20q). PTH-resistant hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia
is the most prominent laboratory abnormality in PHP1B, but resistance to other hormones and
additional aspects of this disease are now well recognized. To identify the molecular causes
underlying different PHP1B variants, each with unique epigenetic changes, we will investigate
patients with as-yet undefined genetic defects. In Aim 1, we will use various approaches,
including comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), whole genome sequencing (WGS), and
genetic linkage studies, to search in familial and sporadic forms of PHP1B with loss-of-
methylation (LOM) at exon A/B alone (PHP1BA/B-) for GNAS duplications and novel mutations
within STX16/GNAS or elsewhere in the genome. In addition, we will search for a novel genetic
defect(s) outside the chromosome 20q13.3 region that leads to a familial PHP1B variant
characterized by LOM at the maternal GNAS exons A/B, XL, and AS, yet gain-of-methylation
(GOM) of the maternal exon NESP (PHP1BNESP+), i.e. epigenetic findings indistinguishable from
those in sporPHP1B patients. In addition, we will define previously not recognized clinical
features of PHP1B, namely reduced female fertility and a high incidence of PHP1B associated
with in vitro fertilization (IVF). Furthermore, we will expand our observation that female carriers of
a STX16/GNAS mutation preferentially pass the mutant allele to the next generation. In Aim 2,
we will determine whether genomic deletions spanning the region from Stx16 to Gnas that were
introduced into mice through iGONAD allow the rapid identification of regions responsible for
Gnas methylation. These efforts are expected to generate a viable murine model of AD-PHP1B
that will help determine which molecular mechanisms contribute to development of PTH-resistant
hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, and which Gnas-derived transcripts affect methylation of
the DMRs at exons Nesp and 1A during oocyte maturation. Lastly, we will use re-primed naïve
H9 embryonic stem cells and iPS cells derived from an AD-PHP1B patient to determine whether
AS transcripts regulate methylation of GNAS exons NESP and A/B."

The overarching aim of this proposal, which is in response to PA-20-185, asks whether alcohol use
exacerbates the motor and cognitive deficits of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) (cross-sectionally), and
whether drinking accelerates progression of MCI toward dementia (longitudinally). The answers have
implications for harm reduction, especially if ""non-hazardous levels"" of alcohol consumption prove to be
deleterious to individuals with MCI, in terms of postural stability and risk of falling that can affect activities of
daily living and quality of life. We propose three specific aims:
Specific Aim 1: Test cross-sectional and longitudinal relations between drinking rates and static
balance and dynamic gait in MCI and control men and women.
Hypothesis: Higher rates of alcohol use will be associated with greater instability and slower gait in MCI
compared with lower drinking MCI and controls matched in age, sex, and alcohol consumption variables.
Hypothesis: At follow-up, accelerated cognitive decline in those with MCI will be predicted by slower natural
gait and greater alcohol consumption compared with MCI with faster gait and lower alcohol consumption.
Specific Aim 2: Use causal modeling to test multi-factorial determinants of static and dynamic stability
metrics: alcohol consumption, sex, sensory physiology, cognitive performance, hematological
measures of nutrition, physical and cognitive activities history, and activities of daily living (ADL).
Hypothesis: Cross-sectionally, factors related to greater instability in MCI will be greater alcohol consumption,
poorer sensory testing, and markers of poorer nutrition. In turn, these biomarkers of compromised function will
predict poorer ADLs and quality of life.
Hypothesis: Longitudinal measures will confirm cross-sectional relations and identify metrics that track
standing instability, gait slowing, poorer ADL, and decline toward dementia with greater alcohol consumption.
Specific Aim 3: Identify brain mechanisms of instability factors identified with causal modeling.
Hypothesis: Factors related to greater imbalance and gait slowing identified with causal models will be related
to smaller and compromised cerebello-pontine-motor cortical nodes and circuitry, whereas factors defining
cognitive and mnemonic status will be related to smaller limbic and parietal volumes and diminished integrity of
related circuitry. Both the balance and cognitive relations will be mediated by alcohol consumption rates.
Hypothesis: Longitudinal analysis will reveal that these relations are enduring. Further, greater rates of alcohol
consumption in the testing interim will result in accelerated functional decline in stability, gait speed, and
cognitive status and cerebello-pontine-cortical circuitry.
Exploratory analysis will use hypothesis-free, data-driven, in-house machine/deep learning methods to seek
reliable constellations of factors that predict postural instability, gait impairment, and biomarkers of falling."

 HIV remains a global epidemic and, in the areas of greatest prevalence, disproportionately infects young
women. However, most studies of hyperacute and acute HIV infection of the female genital tract (FGT) are
conducted in in vitro, ex vivo, or nonhuman primate (NHP) models due to practical and ethical concerns. Because
of this, the immune response to HIV in the human FGT during the earliest stages of infection is largely undefined
and the degree to which current model systems recapitulate the events of natural infection is unclear. Critically,
the first cells to be infected following natural HIV infection of the FGT remain unidentified, creating a major hurdle
toward the development of interventions effect at preventing infection. The FRESH (Females Rising through
Education, Support, and Health) cohort in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, is a long-running program that is
designed to identify natural, hyperacute HIV infection and collect a variety of samples in a longitudinal manner,
presenting an unprecedented opportunity to examine the immune and viral dynamics of the FGT during
hyperacute and acute HIV infection. By utilizing cutting-edge transcriptomic techniques that have been validated
by our group, we will be able to elucidate the events within the FGT during this critical time period of infection.
Our overall hypothesis is that the FGT will have a strong inflammatory response that peaks earlier than the
systemic response in peripheral blood and that early inflammation will primarily be driven by antigen-presenting
cells (APCs), particularly plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), while CD4+ T cell subsets will bear the greatest
burden of genital infection. In the first Aim of this proposal, we will investigate the immune response to genital
HIV infection via population-level RNA sequencing using longitudinally collected bulk cellular population samples
from hyperacutely and acutely infected FRESH participants. We will also conduct a single cell transcriptomic
analysis of cells from the genital tract at the earliest time point following the detection of infection to investigate
which specific cellular subpopulations are responsible for inflammation and immune modulation. These analyses
will be supplemented by Luminex cytokine studies and immunofluorescence (IF) imaging of cervicovaginal
biopsy tissues from FRESH participants. In the second Aim, we will investigate the viral dynamics of hyperacute
genital HIV infection by identifying and visualizing infected cells using single cell RNA sequencing and tandem
in situ hybridization (ISH) and IF imaging. Additionally, we will examine the diversity of viral quasispecies present
in the FGT and in plasma at this time point to better ascertain the frequency with which local foci of infection in
the FGT successfully develop to establish systemic infection. The proposed studies will for the first time enable
a clear outline of key early immunological and viral events that occur during hyperacute and acute HIV infection
of the human FGT, allowing for the validation of existing experimental models and informing the development of
interventions to prevent HIV infection and spread."
10754896,"Background: The Veterans Health Administration has a long history of providing maintenance dialysis
treatment for Veterans with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the community under the VA Fee Basis
program. Starting Fiscal Year 2015, access to specialized nephrology care in the community became available
to the much larger population of Veterans with advanced kidney disease not yet on dialysis under the Veterans
Choice Program (VCP) and is expected to continue under a consolidated Community Care program. Like their
counterparts on dialysis, Veterans with advanced kidney disease not on dialysis are a high-cost high-needs
population for whom access to care, continuity of care and coordination of care are all vitally important in
optimizing quality and outcomes. All three metrics are important in building strong relationships between
patients and providers, and supporting the kind of iterative cycle of evaluation and re-evaluation and care
coordination needed to properly care for these patients
Objective: We will use mixed methods to study the impact of the VA’s evolving community care policy on
outcomes and costs for Veterans with advanced kidney disease and identify opportunities for program
improvement. Because many of the outcomes and care processes relevant to this population are sensitive to
continuity and coordination of care, we hypothesize that receipt of VA-financed nephrology care in the
community will negatively impact a range of clinical outcomes and care processes relevant to this population
and will be more costly than nephrology care provided within the VA. We anticipate that for some groups, the
potential harms of care fragmentation and discontinuity may be outweighed by the benefits of more timely
receipt of needed care in the community. Because some VA medical centers may be more effective in
coordinating care with community providers to mitigate the effects of care fragmentation, we hypothesize that
there will be heterogeneity in the effect of VA-financed community care within the population and across VA
medical centers that could be informative in improving the process of community referral for this population.
Methods: We will use national VA administrative and clinical data to track the impact of VA-financed
community care on clinical outcomes, care processes and costs to the VA system among Veterans with
advanced kidney disease using an instrumental variable approach (Aim 1). To identify opportunities for
improving the value of community referral for this population, we will elicit the perspectives and experiences of
Veterans with advanced kidney disease eligible for, or receiving VA-financed community care and their VA and
community care providers (Aim 2).
Impact: This proposal will directly address three VA HSR&D priority areas (Health Care Systems Change,
Healthcare Access and Patient-centered Care, Care Management, and Health Promotion). The work proposed
here is extraordinarily timely and policy-relevant given that the VA MISSION Act of 2018 recently passed both
the House and the Senate with strong bipartisan support. We anticipate that our work to measure the impact of
VA-financed community nephrology care on Veterans with advanced kidney disease will help to identify
opportunities for more effective use of agency resources to optimize access, continuity and coordination of
care for a high-cost high-needs segment of the Veteran population. To ensure that our work is poised to shape
evolving VA policy around provision of community care, the investigators are partnering with the VHA National
Program for Kidney Disease and the Office of Community Care."
10831066,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Although the etiopathogenesis of Type 1 (T1D) and Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is different, decreased
functional β-cell mass is a central feature in both diseases. Concerted research efforts aim at developing
strategies to improve β-cell survival and restore β-cell function in patients with diabetes. Cellular senescence is
a major hallmark of aging. Recent work has demonstrated that β-cell senescence is a common contributor to
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) and Type 2 diabetes (T2D). RNA modifications are emerging as important modulators of
many hallmarks of aging. We have discovered that m6A mRNA methylation is essential for β-cell function and
survival, and recently characterized the m6A landscape of human T1D and T2D islets. Our preliminary data
shows that the m6A eraser ALKBH5 is upregulated in aged human β-cells and differentially m6A methylated
genes in T1D and T2D are enriched for DNA damage response and senescence pathways compared to controls.
The goal of this application is to use state-of-the art methods to characterize the m6A methylome of the aging β-
cell and identify m6A-regulated pathways that underlie the accelerated β-cell senescence in diabetes. I will test
the overarching hypothesis that aging β-cells exhibit transcript-specific m6A hypomethylation and consequent
upregulation of mRNAs involved in driving cell senescence, and that m6A is therefore a valuable therapeutic
target for diabetes. In Specific Aim 1, I will characterize the temporal m6A landscape of the aging β-cell.
Completion of Aim 1, which will take place during K99 phase, will provide me with training in aspects of aging
biology and further experience with bioinformatics analysis of m6A data necessary to independently complete
the R00 phase and future R01 submissions. In Specific Aim 2, which will span the K99 and R00 phases, I will
identify the molecular targets of ALKBH5 in the human β-cell transition to senescence. Completion of the sub-
aim of Aim 2 proposed during the K99 phase will provide me with the training in photoactivatable ribonucleoside-
enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) sequencing and data analysis necessary to
complement Aim 1, and independently complete Aim 2 during the R00 phase. For Specific Aim 3, I will target
m6A levels to reduce β-cell senescence and improve diabetes in vivo. Completion of this aim will allow me to
validate candidate genes identified in Aim’s 1 and 2 and to test in vivo the role of Alkbh5 in driving the accelerated
senescence seen in β-cells in diabetes. These experiments are novel as they combine omics-based approaches,
mouse genetic models, physiology, and molecular biology to examine the mechanistic role of m6A, and
particularly ALKBH5, in β-cell senescence transition in diabetes."

The vertebrate brain has evolved to enable complex social interactions, essential for survival. Brains of animals
engaged in a shared social interaction exhibit inter-brain synchronization of neural activity, detectable at several
levels of analysis. It remains unclear what aspects of social behavior are driven by these intriguing inter-brain
dynamics. We propose to develop and apply a revolutionary set of molecular-genetic and optical tools to record
and manipulate neural activity wirelessly and simultaneously in multiple interacting animals from distantly related
rodent species across a broad spectrum of sociality. These studies include evaluation of synchrony parameters,
along with causal imposition of synchrony to drive social behaviors and attachment. We aim to leverage novel
functional genetic approaches to identify the cellular and subcellular basis and neuromodulatory mechanisms
that underlie the emergence and strengthening of synchrony. This project will revolutionize our concept of the
social brain, placing a multi-dimensional emphasis on neural activity within and across interacting brains, linked
by the non-corporeal bonds of shared life. This is critical for understanding the full breadth of human sociality,
identity, neurotypical and atypical behavior, as well as mental and physical health."

10881976,"PROPOSAL SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Establishing proper cell identities and tissue architecture during early embryogenesis is crucial for a
successful pregnancy. Coordination of these processes is integral to patterning the mammalian embryos as they
increase complexity from the implantation stages. However, how this tight coordination is regulated remains
poorly understood. A high rate of mortality seen in human embryos during the first 2-3 weeks post-fertilization is
a major cause of early pregnancy loss, yet the essential cellular, molecular, and mechanical changes remain
almost entirely uncharacterized.
 Rather than merely a structural component that provides physical support, recent studies have shown that
the extracellular matrix (ECM) has emerging roles in regulating cell fate specification and morphogenesis. My
recent work reveals that the embryonic basement membrane (BM), a specialized ECM, plays an essential role
in patterning the early post-implantation mammalian embryo. My preliminary results lay the foundation of my
proposal to determine how the BM coordinates the collective cell behaviors and facilitates pattern formation at
critical developmental stages of early mammalian embryogenesis.
 We will apply novel technologies, including 4D quantitative imaging and single-cell spatial genomics,
combined with in vivo, in vitro, and in silico approaches to test the hypothesis that the BM facilitates embryo
patterning through coordinating cell fate specification and tissue morphodynamics. In my first aim, we will
comprehensively map the cell behaviors and the morphodynamics of the developing embryos with 3D
quantitative imaging and timelapse imaging approaches. We will define the role of the BM through genetic
manipulations in stem cell-derived embryo-like models as well as in the natural embryos. In my second aim, we
will map the BM organization and apply single-cell spatial transcriptomics approaches to generate in situ fate
maps. We will functionally test how the BM regulates cell identities by quantitatively defining gene expression
patterns with BM architecture and validate the findings with loss-of-function analyses. Next, we will build
mathematical models that integrate cell identities and cell dynamics with the BM mechanics to uncover
mechanisms of pattern formation. In my third aim, we will apply the technologies and tools developed in the
previous two aims to explore the roles of the BM in shaping the formation of germ layers during gastrulation.
 Overall, my proposed work will increase our understanding of how extracellular cues facilitate a successful
pregnancy and could inspire novel therapeutic approaches to prevent early pregnancy loss. The training provided
by this award will allow me to acquire the necessary skills to develop my independent research program to apply
a quantitative systems-level approach to uncover the dynamics, functions, and regulations that shape the
embryos at critical stages of early pregnancy."
10847496,"To facilitate the diagnosis of among 7000 rare genetic diseases, clinicians have developed diagnostic
criteria that enumerate different elements that define disease. These include medical problems, physical exam
findings, laboratory test results, and imaging findings. However, most clinical diagnostic criteria have unknown
predictive value. Despite being critical for diagnosis and provision of genetic testing, they are typically proposed
without rigorous evidence or estimates of performance such as sensitivity or specificity. Suboptimal criteria may
cause faulty interpretations of genetic testing with variants of uncertain clinical significance or lead clinicians to
overlook diagnosis, depriving patients of prognostication, reproductive planning, or targeted molecular therapies.
Our previous work has delineated an approach to more evidence-based rare disease criteria. We developed
novel clinical criteria for nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome using survey data and statistical optimization,
and we estimate the novel criteria have improved sensitivity compared to the existing expert consensus criteria,
particularly at early ages (53% versus 13% at 7 years). My central hypothesis is that diagnosis of rare pediatric
genetic disease can be improved by utilizing evidence-based diagnostic approaches. Moreover, such
approaches may be one avenue to address inequities in the provision of genetic referral and testing among
individuals belonging to historically marginalized groups. Therefore, I will scale our previous work across the
spectrum of rare genetic diseases using comprehensive, clinician-validated phenotype information to establish
and test diagnostic methodologies.
 To address this hypothesis and progress towards my long-term career goal of becoming and independent
physician-scientist that advances accurate and timely diagnosis for all children with a rare genetic disease, I
have developed a comprehensive five-year career development plan. This plan delineates a strategy to gain
knowledge and experience with natural language processing and machine learning, human-centered design and
human factors, and electronic health record intervention. Using these new skills, I will create comprehensive,
chronological phenotype histories for over 37,000 children with suspected or confirmed genetic disease. I will
embed a tool in the clinical workflow that elicits clinician validation of these phenotypes. From these data, I will
implement a framework to develop and validate diagnostic criteria in genetic disease. I will initially focus on 10
specific diseases. I will also develop computationally tractable machine learning algorithms to aid in diagnosis at
scale. Next, I will develop a web-based user interface to empower other clinicians to develop and test their own
diagnostic criteria. Finally, I will apply the same phenotyping and machine learning approaches at the health
system level to predict which children are more likely to be diagnosed with a rare genetic disease. These
endeavors will generate a foundation to establish my long-term research program that will implement clinical
decision support for genetic diagnosis and prepare me to become an independent R01-funded investigator."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the predominant causes of disability and dependency among older
people, and the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. Late-onset AD is the most common form,
with more than 99% of AD cases occurring after age 65. The strongest genetic risk factor for developing
late-onset AD is carrying the APOE4 allele. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is primarily expressed by glial cells in
the brain and is the major protein component of lipoprotein particles secreted by astrocytes and microglia.
Lipoprotein particles provide a bidirectional mechanism of lipid transport between glia and neurons. Many
recent studies suggest that a disequilibrium in nervous system lipids is associated with increased risk of
developing AD. However, the mechanisms by which APOE4 affects cellular lipid homeostasis are
incompletely understood. We recently discovered that in glia, APOE can traffic to cytoplasmic lipid droplets
(LDs) rather than undergoing secretion on lipoprotein particles. We hypothesize that APOE plays previously
unrecognized roles in cellular lipid metabolism by acting directly on LDs in astrocytes and microglia.
Astrocytes play important roles in metabolizing peroxidated lipids, while microglia are the primary innate
immune effector cells of the central nervous system. In Aim 1, we will test the effect of modulating APOE in
astrocytes on cellular lipid composition, metabolism, and lipid peroxidation. In Aim 2, we will test the effect
of modulating APOE in microglia on cellular lipid composition, metabolism, and inflammation. In Aim 3, we
will fill a key knowledge gap by developing a community resource visualizing and quantifying LDs in various
brain regions and cell types in mice of different genotypes and ages. Together, these studies will lead to
new insights about the cellular and molecular mechanism by which expression of APOE4 leads to increased
risk of late-onset AD. This work could also lead to the identification of novel drug targets for preventing and
treating AD."

We propose to develop The University of Kansas Cancer Center (KUCC) Paul Calabresi K12 Career
Development Award for Clinical Oncology (“KUCC K12 Program”), whose primary goal is to train and develop
independent cancer researchers by providing didactic coursework, and research and career mentorship. The
theme of the KUCC K12 Program is in clinical and translational cancer research, with a particular focus on
clinical trials, which leverages the unique strengths of KUCC. KUCC is an ideal institution and provides an
outstanding environment to train clinical and translational researchers because of its strengths in cancer
therapeutics, diagnostics, and medical device development; a robust cancer experimental therapeutics
program; KUCC Shared Resources that facilitate conduct of clinical trials and associated translational
components; and patient-centered research. With no directly competing training program, the KUCC K12
Program will be the flagship cancer-specific training program for junior faculty at the institution and in the
region. The KUCC K12 Program will fill a current unmet need at KUCC by providing a cancer-specific training
program, and also help fill a current geographic void from a relative lack of K12 Programs in the region. The
Program has 22 primary mentors and 24 secondary mentors – with extensive expertise in clinical trials,
translational research, teaching and mentorship. The Program is led by Ronald Chen, MD, MPH, a
distinguished clinician, clinical researcher and clinical trialist, who has extensive experience with
education/mentorship and training program design and administration. Associate Program Director (Dr. Scott
Weir) and Assistant PD (Dr. Lisa Harlan-Williams) bring complementary expertise in translational research,
basic research, and educational program development and leadership. The Internal Advisory Board and
External Advisory Board members provide significant additional experience and expertise in the development,
administration and evaluation of training programs, including K12 programs. We will finalize curriculum
development and recruit high-quality scholars in Year 1 of the award and start training scholars in Year 2. We
propose to recruit one new scholar in Year 2 and two new scholars per year after, and each scholar’s training
will be 2-3 years. Unique aspects of the KUCC K12 Program include team science training, communication
skills development (both scientific communication and communication with a lay/community audience), and
didactic and experiential training on patient-oriented research, including pairing each scholar with a trained
patient advocate. Each scholar will also be mentored to develop a clinical trial, and a K to R Seminar will
mentor each scholar to write a high-quality and submission-ready independent research proposal. There is
tremendous institutional support in the forms of funding the third year of scholar training and additional funding
of $15,000/year for the Program. Up to $200,000 in supplemental salary support per scholar per year will be
provided by the Institution to establish parity between scholars and their clinically-oriented colleagues."
10874790,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal seeks to develop a targeted tri-agonist “super adjuvant” nanoparticle platform for in situ cancer
vaccination. Vaccines consist of 2 components: a tumor-specific antigen that is recognized by CD8+ cytotoxic T
cells (CTLs) and an adjuvant that provides the necessary costimulatory cytokine signals to antigen-presenting
cells (APCs) to prime and activate a CTL response. In complex diseases like cancer, however, a single-
adjuvant vaccine may not be fully effective to mitigate the myriad immunosuppressive effects of a
heterogeneous aggressive tumor microenvironment (TME) such as that of triple-negative breast cancer
(TNBC). Co-delivery of multiple adjuvants in a rationally designed “super adjuvant” formulation can harness
multiple pattern recognition receptor pathways simultaneously to drive a proinflammatory synergistic cytokine
response that has both breadth and depth. Further, compared to standard vaccination, where a preselected
antigen and adjuvant are delivered to lymph nodes, in situ vaccination, where only the adjuvant is delivered
directly to the tumor, has clear advantages. In an in situ approach, the tumor itself provides the antigen in the
form of neoantigens shed from dying tumor cells. This approach captures patient heterogeneity on a
personalized basis and does not require prior knowledge of tumor antigens. Current in situ approaches,
including free agonists, free cytokines, and immunogenic viruses, rely heavily on direct intratumoral injection to
minimize off-target toxicity and are cancer type-specific. Intratumoral delivery itself also has serious limitations
in both delivery and efficacy. Supported by our recent publications and additional preliminary data, this high-
risk proposal seeks to address these shortcomings by designing a “super adjuvant” immunomodulatory
nanoparticle (immuno-NP) platform that coencapsulates 3 synergistic Type I interferon-driving innate immune
agonists on the same NP using lipid-based materials and microfluidics. Specifically, 60-nm PEGylated
immuno-NPs will be designed to be delivered safely in the systemic blood circulation to co-deliver agonists of
the STING, TLR4, and TLR9 pathways to tumors. They will also be targeted to multiple specific types of cells in
the TME, including APCs, activated endothelial cells, and tumor cells, to orchestrate a concerted multi-cellular
response that may be necessary to eliminate heterogeneous aggressive tumors. We hypothesize that targeted
tri-agonist “super adjuvant” immuno-NPs will drive a synergistic Type I interferon-mediated APC response that
activates CTLs for tumor clearance in multiple mouse models of TNBC. Specific Aim 1 will identify immuno-NP
design parameters required for optimal function in terms of promoted cytokine breadth and depth. Specific Aim
2 will establish immuno-NP targeting schemes for effective TME homing and therapeutic efficacy. These
studies will effectively address the delivery, efficacy, and safety challenges that severely limit current
approaches. As a platform technology, successful development of this “super adjuvant” immuno-NP also has
wide-ranging applications in standard lymph node-directed vaccination for both cancer and infectious disease."

overdoses and suicide attempts during the COVID pandemic. Individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) have a
lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts exceeding 40%, along with elevated odds of a completed suicide. Among
the 100,000 drug-related overdose deaths in 2021—the largest number ever recorded in a 12-month period—
30% or more of such events may in fact be suicides. In 2017, there were over 960,000 ED visits in the US for a
non-fatal overdose, making the ED a critical setting in which to intervene. Behavioral interventions like Screening,
Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) in the ED improve alcohol outcomes, but multiple trials
have failed to show any benefit of SBIRT for individuals with OUD. Structural barriers like ED crowding and lack
of follow up for addiction and psychiatric treatment also mar efforts to treat these diseases. Despite the increased
utilization of medications for OUD (MOUD) in the ED setting, most patients still do not receive MOUD in the ED,
and among those who do, the majority do not continue treatment after discharge. Therefore, there is a critical
need for research to identify treatments that can be delivered effectively and sustainably in the ED for individuals
with OUD particularly for those who are endorsing suicidal ideation. Ketamine has garnered interest due to its
potential in treating psychiatric disorders, rapidly diminishing depressive and suicidal symptoms among
individuals with treatment-resistant depression. Sub-anesthetic doses of ketamine administered in either single
or multiple sessions in conjunction with psychotherapy has shown beneficial effects for patients with alcohol,
opioid, and cocaine use disorders. A major advantage of ketamine is that it is already an accepted
pharmacotherapy used routinely in the ED for procedural sedation, agitation, and acute pain. If ketamine could
be used as an effective pharmacotherapy for OUD and suicidal ideation in the ED, the approach would be
consistent with Screening, Treatment Initiation, and Referral (STIR) which may be more beneficial than the
traditional SBIRT approach. However there remains a significant gap in understanding the safety of ED-initiated
ketamine for those with OUD in the ED. To fill this need, we propose to conduct a pilot, double-blind, placebo-
controlled randomized trial with the primary aim of assessing the safety of administering ketamine in the ED to
OUD patients who are endorsing suicidal ideation. Those who are eligible will be randomly assigned to receive
either a single infusion of ketamine or saline placebo. Vital signs, side effects, psychiatric adverse effects, opioid
withdrawal, and cravings for opioids and ketamine will be monitored closely throughout the ED admission. As a
secondary aim, we will determine the preliminary efficacy of ketamine on opioid- and suicide-related outcomes.
Mechanisms of behavior change will be explored. If successful, this line of research will help establish the safety
of ketamine administration for OUD in the ED, and facilitate the design of a larger efficacy trial."

Cisplatin is one of the most widely used anti-cancer drugs, however up to 70% of patients can suffer from severe
dose-limiting ototoxicity. Platinum-mediated hearing loss is detrimental to the early speech development of
children and can impede neurocognitive abilities, social integration, and financial status. Therefore, the long-
term goal associated with this proposal is to assess the role of membrane transporters in regulating damage
to cochlear cells following accumulation of cisplatin or its metabolites. The overall objective of this proposal
is to delineate the involvement of the monocarboxylate transporter, MCT6, in mediating cisplatin-induced hearing
loss. The central hypothesis is that MCT6 promotes uptake of an N-acetylcysteine S-conjugate metabolite of
cisplatin (NAC-1) resulting in severe damage to cochlear hair cells and loss of hearing. The rationale for this
project is that a predicted reduced functional genetic variant of MCT6 (rs4788863) was previously associated
with lower rates of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. Evaluating the mechanism by which MCT6 contributes to
cisplatin-mediated hearing loss is necessary to address whether pharmacological inhibition of this transporter
would be protective of an adverse event that has no current curative or preventative measures. The central
hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Investigate the ability of MCT6 to transport NAC-1;
and 2) Determine the protective effect of MCT6-deficiency on cisplatin-induced ototoxicity in vivo. Under the first
aim, in vitro models with high expression of MCT6 will be used to measure the ability of this transporter to
modulate uptake of NAC-1 as well as cisplatin. Additionally, the influence of the rs478863 genetic variant, or
pharmacological inhibition of MCT6, on platinum uptake or cytotoxicity will be assessed. Under the second aim,
a MCT6-deficient in vivo mouse model will be used to evaluate the severity of cisplatin-induced hearing loss in
the absence of the MCT6 transporter. Moreover, we will measure pharmacokinetic changes of cisplatin in MCT6-
deficient mice. This will provide mechanistic insight into the role of MCT6 in the handling of cisplatin or its
metabolites. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it represents a substantive
departure from the status quo by evaluating the role MCT6 as a regulator of cochlear damage via facilitating
accumulation of a toxic cisplatin metabolite. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to
identify MCT6 as a transporter that can be pharmacologically targeted to reduce the severity of, or prevent,
cisplatin-induced hearing loss associated with cancer therapy. Ultimately, such knowledge is predicted to reduce
the number of patients who would experience significant social and economic challenges, including in young
pediatric cancer survivors."

Based on evidence from multiple systematic reviews, hypertension guidelines strongly recommend that
hypertensive patients measure their blood pressure (BP) at home as an approach to improving BP control so
long as this self-measured BP monitoring (SMBP) is conducted with clinical support (i.e., Supported SMBP).
Pragmatic trials demonstrate that Supported SMBP increases opportunities for medication titrations, increases
BP medication regimen intensity and adherence, and ultimately, improves BP control. Yet, few health systems
are systematically implementing Supported SMBP, and less than 20% of hypertensive patients routinely
measure their BP at home, resulting in a gap in the translation of evidence-based recommendations into
practice. This gap is driven by lack of knowledge regarding how best to implement Supported SMBP to
maximize uptake by patients and providers at an acceptable health system cost.
In partnership with leaders at New York-Presbyterian (NYP), we developed a nurse-supported SMBP
intervention in which
a centralized team of nurses is responsible for engaging patients in SMBP, monitoring
SMBP data, and providing feedback on HTN control to patients and providers
. We next followed a theory-
driven process (the Behavior Change Wheel) to select an implementation strategy aimed at increasing uptake
of Supported SMBP. We identified telemonitoring as a key implementation strategy. We then pilot tested this
intervention and implementation strategy at one clinic and found moderate uptake and promising trends in BP
control, but there was still a need to improve the implementation strategy. Few if any studies have assessed
the systematic implementation of Supported SMBP in primary care, particularly in low-income settings.
We now propose to apply human-centered design to refine our implementation strategy, and then implement
and evaluate the Supported SMBP intervention across a primary care network (12 clinics) that provides care to
socioeconomically diverse patients (27,600 HTN patients, 35% with uncontrolled BP). We will evaluate the
program by conducting a parallel-group cluster randomized trial in which clinics will be randomly assigned
to early (intervention) versus delayed (wait-list control) implementation of the telemonitoring-enabled, nurse-
supported SMBP intervention. The primary clinical effectiveness outcome will be pre-to-post implementation
change in the clinic mean of patients' last systolic BP during a 12-month calendar period. The impact of the
implementation strategy will be assessed by measuring uptake of Supported SMBP by patients and providers
and by interviewing patients and providers to assess key implementation outcomes (acceptability, fidelity). To
inform dissemination, the cost-effectiveness of the intervention from a health system and total healthcare cost
perspective will also be assessed. If successful, our project will provide a roadmap for widely implementing
SMBP, and will accelerate a change in the paradigm of hypertension management from the clinic to the home."

The overarching scientific premise of this application is to evaluate how the accumulation of social advantage
and adversity over the full life course impacts risk and resilience against Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Related
Dementias (ADRD). While there is considerable enthusiasm across the social and biological sciences
regarding the sociobiological underpinnings of multifaceted diseases, including a growing research base on the
social exposome and social determinants of health, evidence clearly linking *lifetime* social exposures to
AD/ADRD remains limited. Existing work has been hampered by the paucity of data that covers the full life
course, and relative inattention to how sex and, especially gender, may shape these processes. We address
these gaps with the competing renewal application of an NIA-funded R01 (AG06073), entitled the “Wisconsin
Longitudinal Study-Initial Lifetime’s Impact on ADRD (WLS-ILIAD)”, which began tracking AD and related
dementia onset in 2019 among a cohort of older adults with prospectively collected data extending to their birth
year. Having achieved an ~80% response rate during the current grant cycle (2018-2023), the renewed project
would continue to assess for dementia as participants surpass age 85. We propose to continue the WLS-ILIAD
project to build an invaluable and uniquely comprehensive dataset, which will allow us-and our broader user
base-to characterize the AD biomarkers, cognitive, social, behavioral, and medical profile of participants at risk
or resilient to dementia. The specific aims for this proposal include: Aim 1: We will continue to track dementia
in the WLS cohort using rigorous AD biomarkers, when participants will be ~age 85-90. As before, data will be
released for broad public use. Aim 2: We will add plasma AD biomarkers to the full sample (n=~5000) to
examine whether core AD biomarkers predict and moderate cognitive function, AD risk, or resilience. Amyloid
and tau PET brain scans, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection will be performed on 200 participants with
100 follow up visits to validate the blood-based biomarkers and identify cut points for specific blood AD
biomarkers. Aim 3. Examine how accumulated social advantage and adversity influence risk and resilience
against dementia onset, with attention to sex/gender differences. This aim focuses on two forms of resilience.
The first is resilience to dementia. Regardless of underlying pathology, the costs attributable to dementia are
high, with global health care spending on dementia projected to reach $1.6 trillion by 2050, so attention to its
determinants are critical. The second type is the absence of clinical symptoms or dementia in the presence of
AD pathology as established through antemortem disease biomarkers. Aim 4: Drawing on AD biomarkers
collected in Aim 2, we will fold a large sample (n=468) of African American and Indigenous participants
enrolled in the Wisconsin ADRC to analyze how early life advantage and adversity impact resilience in
cognitive function in the presence of AD pathology. This extends the aims of the prior grant period’s attention
to early life influences on dementia risk and resilience."

Genetic and gene expression studies have revolutionized our understanding of the plasma cell malignancy
multiple myeloma. As a result, myeloma molecular subtypes have been defined, and genetic markers of high-
risk disease now prioritize patients for risk-adapted therapies. Yet current molecular markers fail to identify over
40% of high-risk patients who relapse or die within two years of diagnosis. High-risk myeloma is exemplified by
a proliferation gene expression subtype that contains genetic alterations normally found in standard-risk
subtypes. Therefore, this high-risk myeloma is not explained by underlying genetic events suggesting an
epigenetic component. Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation (DNAm) regulate gene expression
and provide mechanistic insight into tumor suppressor and oncogene activity. Importantly, DNAm is maintained
through cell division and can propagate cancerous phenotypes. Our studies in mice have shown a dramatic
remodeling of DNAm during plasma cell differentiation, and that disruption of DNA methyltransferase activity
promotes plasma cell proliferation. Yet there is limited data on the role of DNAm in high-risk myeloma and the
proliferation subtype. We hypothesize that dysregulation of DNAm contributes to uncontrolled proliferation in
high-risk myeloma. This will be investigated through computational analyses of somatic genetic alterations from
whole genome sequencing, gene expression from RNA-seq, and DNAm data derived from whole genome
bisulfite sequencing on 392 specimens from the CoMMpass trial (NCT01454297). In aim 1, we will determine
the DNAm program of myeloma subtypes defined by both somatic alterations and gene expression. Here, a
focus will be to elucidate the epigenetic program of high-risk proliferative disease. In aim 2, we will identify the
DNAm program prognostic of poor outcome and contrast that with changes observed in relapsed specimens.
DNAm loci associated with the proliferative subtype, prognostic of outcome, and reprogrammed in relapse
myeloma will be prioritized for interrogation using CRISPR-based site-specific epigenetic editing. Results from
these aims will help resolve the functional consequences of dysregulated DNAm in aggressive myeloma and
provide a molecular map of multiple myeloma in the context of patient outcomes. Insights from this work will
prioritize avenues for follow-up translational and mechanistic studies to target high-risk multiple myeloma."

Title: Structural and functional analysis of a novel class of androgen receptor antagonists
Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and androgen receptor (AR)-targeting agents are the mainstay of
metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) treatment. However, PCa on ADT and/or AR-targeting agents usually lead to
relapse and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which is mainly driven by AR activation under
castration conditions. Next-generation AR-targeting agents such as enzalutamide and abiraterone can inhibit
AR in CRPC but prolong the survival of CRPC patients for only about 4-5 months on average. The major
mechanism responsible for the resistance to next-generation AR-targeting agents is reactivation of AR. Novel
strategies to block the development of resistance to the current AR-targeted therapy are an urgent need and a
major drug development challenge. Existing FDA-approved AR antagonists compete with dihydrotestosterone
(DHT) for binding to the ligand binding domain (LBD) of AR, and patients eventually develop resistance to
these treatments. One approach to overcoming resistance is to develop compounds that inhibit AR in
alternative ways. We have identified a small molecule, SID 3712502, that is capable of inhibiting AR lacking
LBD. To optimize the efficacy of this new class of inhibitors, we developed structural analogues and identified
(+)-JJ-74-138 as a promising candidate. Our preliminary data suggest that (+)-JJ-74-138 is a novel AR
antagonist capable of degrading nuclear AR and inhibiting enzalutamide-resistant CRPC both in culture and in
xenograft tumors. However, it is not yet clear how AR interacts with (+)-JJ-74-138, which makes it difficult to
rationally develop more potent analogues. We propose the following 2 specific aims to define how (+)-JJ-74-
138 and its parent compound SID 3712502 bind to AR and develop new analogs with improved potency,
aqueous solubility and specificity for inhibition and degradation of nuclear AR. Aim 1 will determine how the
SID 3712502 scaffold binds to AR using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM). We will purify full-length AR
(AR-FL), characterize interactions of AR-FL with SID 3712502 and (+)-JJ-74-138 for cryoEM structural analysis
of a suitable complex of AR-FL2/R1881/ARE/SID 3712502 (or (+)-JJ-74-138) using single particle methods.
Aim 2 will design, synthesize and analyze analogues of (+)-JJ-74-138, with the goal to identify small molecules
with submicromolar potency, improved aqueous solubility, and high specificity for AR-positive cells. We will
systematically prepare analogs of the lead compound(s) in iterative rounds of physicochemical improvements
and optimizations based on structure–activity relationship (SAR) analyses from in vitro and cell-based assays.
The success of this project will greatly facilitate the development of this class of novel AR antagonists for the
treatment of CRPC, including enzalutamide-resistant CRPC."
10911085,"The goal of this application is to increase the efficacy of existing treatments for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)
and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by identifying and characterizing RNA processing phenotypes that predict
age-related disease progression and drug resistance. Current therapies for both of these devastating diseases
are effective in only a small number of patients and predicting responses remains challenging. Improving
response rates represents a substantial unmet need for Veterans. Like many other cancers, MDS and AML are
most prevalent in aging populations. The Adaptive Oncogenesis model holds that this association is the result
of changing selective pressures acting on heterogeneous populations of cells as we age. MDS and AML are also
characterized by extensive heterogeneity. This heterogeneity is evident in the molecular profiling of cells from
individual patients, as well as in variable response to treatments across patients. Preliminary data show that
mRNA processing and regulation are also highly variable in these diseases. As changes to these processes can
play a critical role in cancer, this proposal seeks to understand how variability in mRNA processing and regulation
drives disease progression and resistance to drug treatment in MDS and AML. The proposed studies use new
sequencing methods to capture the full range of mRNA processing and regulation heterogeneity in MDS and
AML at single-cell resolution. Using primary human and MDS and AML specimens, as well as murine models of
AML, these studies will allow us to identify specific mRNA processing and regulation phenotypes that allow
malignant cells to take advantage of changes to tissue environments associated with aging and drug treatment.
Targeting the molecular mechanisms underlying these phenotypes will improve treatments and enhance the
prediction of clinical outcomes for Veterans with MDS and AML. In addition to studies using primary specimens
and animal models, this application will leverage “big data” resources to identify clinically relevant mRNA
processing and regulation signatures from that can inform the clinical management of patients. This award will
support the continued development of software tools to interpret changes in RNA processing from single-cell
sequencing data. Taken together, the proposed studies will provide important new insights into the interplay
between mRNA isoform heterogeneity, drug resistance, and aging in MDS/AML and will identify novel
therapeutic targets that can be used to improve the treatment of Veterans with these diseases."

 2 cancers were diagnosed in the VA system in 2010, and prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently
 3 diagnosed cancer among male veterans, with ~12,500 cases or 33% of all cancers reported.
 4 Inhalation or ingestion of toxic air from incomplete combustion are known to increase exposure
 5 to metal ion including lead (Pb) and arsenic (iAs), especially when a great variety of materials
 6 were being burnt in burnpit. iAs and/or Pb exposure have been considered as potential risk factors
 7 for this cancer, but the underlying mechanism is largely undefined. In a small clinical study, we
 8 found that iAs and Pb levels were significantly higher in the urine of PCa patients. Using a new 2-
 9 hit animal model we established, exposure to iAs or Pb was showed to increase (1) PCa risk in
10 vivo, and (2) the ability of prostate epithelial stem-like cells (PrESLCs) isolated from treated
11 animals to form colonies in soft agar, a hallmark of cellular transformation. In this animal model,
12 a 1-month metal treatment followed by chemical carcinogen treatment, resulted in significant
13 increases in PCa incidence and pre-cancerous lesions in iAs-treated animal and trends of increases
14 in Pb-treated animals. Importantly, single-cell RNAseq analyses revealed that Pb was associated
15 with the expansion of a subpopulation of PrESLCs with epithelial lineage markers into stroma-
16 like oncogenic cells, while iAs was associated with the emergence of a rare, unique subpopulation
17 of oncogenic PrESLCs similar to “cancer” stem cells. This application will test the hypothesis that
18 iAs and/or Pb dysregulate specific, and likely different, signaling pathways in subpopulations of
19 prostate epithelial stem-like cells (PrESLCs) to initiate or increase the risk of carcinogenesis in the
20 gland. This is an untested hypothesis in the field of prostate carcinogenesis and in military veterans’
21 health. Two Aims were proposed: 1) Determine the carcinogenic potential of metal-treated prostate
22 epithelial stem-like cells (PrESLCs) in vivo using a renal grafting model of PCa formation assay.
23 We will evaluate the effects of metals on to form PCa in vivo in immune-deficient host mice, either
24 with or without chemical induction of PCa; and 2) Characterize stem-like cells with metal-specific
25 transcriptomic signatures. We will use single-cell RNA sequencing and visualization informatics
26 to identify the unique gene signatures that characterize rare subpopulations of metal-induced
27 cancer stem cells within the PrESLCs population. We aim to apply these gene signatures to enrich
28 rare subpopulations by FACS and evaluate their carcinogenic potential. We will also leverage The
29 Cancer Genome Atlas PCa data and other online databases to enable accurate classification of
30 major, rare, and heterogeneous subtypes of PrESLCs to gain insights in metal carcinogenesis.
31 Findings from the proposed work may address questions related to occupational and post-
32 deployment exposure and expand our knowledge on stem cell biology. Potential Impact on
33 Veterans Health Care: Successful completion of these studies can potentially lead to the
34 development of new PCa prevention and therapeutic strategies. Plans to reduce unnecessary
35 exposure to those metal ions should be implemented as effective strategy for PCa prevention.
36 Drugs targeting to specific subpopulation of stem cells could be used as therapeutic options to
37 prevent early PCa development as well as progression. When applied to veterans, the results of
38 this study may allow saving human lives, improving the health of veterans, and decreasing the
39 number of disabilities in the veteran population."

Abstract:
For patients with high-risk malignant and non-malignant hematologic diseases, hematopoietic stem cell transplant
(HCT) often represents the only option for cure. However, HCT is fraught with complications, leading to high rates of
toxicity and patient death. The principal cause of early non-relapse mortality is acute graft-versus-host disease
(AGVHD), with death from infection a close second. These two are interrelated, as intensifying global immune
suppression to control AGVHD increases infection risk. Moreover, augmented immunosuppression can also increase
the risk of malignant relapse. To move the field forward, we must develop targeted, evidence-based prevention and
treatment strategies, designed to specifically control alloreactivity while preserving anti-tumor and anti-viral protective
immunity. Perhaps the greatest need for these targeted therapeutics is in GI AGVHD, the leading cause of AGVHD-
related death. Two issues predominate, which significantly impede progress: (1) We do not adequately understand
the distinct mechanisms controlling GI T cell infiltration versus tissue residency or damage, which inhibits
development of specific therapies. (2) We do not understand the mechanisms driving steroid-refractory GI AGVHD,
significantly slowing treatment development for this most deadly type of AGVHD. The goal of this proposal is to
address these unmet needs, and thereby discover the next generation of therapeutics for GI AGVHD.
We will do so by completing the following three Specific Aims: (1): Prioritize and validate next-generation GI-targeted
therapeutics with a novel translational pipeline. We will test the hypothesis that a pipeline from patient/NHP-derived
therapeutic candidates → mouse → NHP AGVHD models can prioritize new AGVHD therapeutics. (2) Determine the
impact of Notch ligand blockade on the blood and GI immune landscape in NHP and transplant patients. We will test
the hypothesis that Notch ligand blockade with the anti-DLL4 mAb REGN421 protects against GI AGVHD, and that it
does so by inhibiting effector T cell infiltration into the GI tract. (3) Identify predictors of steroid responsive and
resistant GI AGVHD in patients. We will test the hypothesis that unifying mechanisms of steroid response and
resistance can be identified in patients by comprehensive linked immune studies of the blood and GI tract at AGVHD
diagnosis. By completing these aims, we will discern the mechanisms driving GI AGVHD, and thus fundamentally
advance our ability to care for patients undergoing HCT."
10891472,"Vaccination of patients against mostly patient-specific neoantigens is posing major challenges in terms of
which antigens to target and is limited to a subset of patients expressing neoantigens in their tumors. Here we
propose to develop a broadly applicable vaccination strategy against a common set of predefined antigens that
are experimentally induced in tumor cells by downregulation of key mediators of antigen processing pathway,
TAP, ERAAP and Invariant chain (Ii). Genetic ablation of TAP or ERAAP leads to the presentation of class I-
restricted neoepitopes that are capable of stimulating T cell responses and inhibit the growth of TAP or ERAAP
deficient tumor cells whereas downregulation of Invariant chain (Ii) leads to the presentation of otherwise
cryptic endogenous class II epitopes. Vaccination against the TAP, ERAAP or Ii downregulation-induced
antigens will constitute a broadly applicable neoantigen-targeted vaccination strategy for patients with
concurrent, recurrent, and future tumors that overcomes the main limitations of vaccinating against mutation-
generated patient-specific neoantigens.
 Proposal is supported by our studies showing that vaccination against the TAP downregulation-induced
antigens, by targeting a TAP siRNA to resident DC in mice thru conjugation to a CpG oligonucleotide (CpG-
TAP siRNA), was more effective than vaccination against prototypic patient-specific mutation-generated
neoantigens, was devoid of measurable toxicity, and inhibited the growth of concurrent and future tumors in
models of recurrence and premalignant disease, provided TAP was also downregulated in the developing
tumors using a broad-range nucleolin binding aptamer to target the TAP siRNA to tumor cells in situ (Nucl-TAP
siRNA).
 The goal of this proposal is to optimize the induced neoantigen vaccination strategy in order to set the
stage for its evaluation in clinical trials: (1). To develop optimal methods to induce neoantigens by
inhibiting key mediators of antigen processing, TAP, ERAAP, and Ii. We hypothesize that given the
synergy between CD4+ and CD8+ T cell immunity, TAP or ERAAP downregulation that elicit CD8+ T cell
responses combined with Ii downregulation that elicit CD4+ T cell responses will be the most effective
combinations. (2) To evaluate combinations with cell-targeted immune potentiating modalities. We will
test two novel tumor- and T cell-targeted strategies, to sensitize tumors to a proinflammatory immune
response, i.e. convert “cold” to “hot” tumor lesions, and to promote the intratumoral accumulation of tumor-
resident CD8+ T cells (Trm), respectively. (3) Develop lead compounds for clinical trials. Identify the best-
in-class targets, TAP, ERAAP, Ii, or combination of, to stimulate human CD8+ T cell responses in vitro using
CpG-siRNA treated DC, that will recognize tumor cells treated with Nucl-siRNA to induce the presentation of
said antigens on the tumor cells."
10887635,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cognitive control allows us to flexibly guide our actions based on our goals. Central to most prominent theories
of cognitive control is the control representation. For control to be successful, this representation is maintained
in working memory by the prefrontal cortex (PFC) where it allows the same input to map to different responses
depending on the context. Convergent evidence has found that the PFC encodes multiple task-relevant
features of a task. However, little is known about the computational features of these control representations
based on how they organize this information. This is a fundamental gap in our understanding. Here we focus
on one such property, termed representational dimensionality. In technical terms, representational
dimensionality refers to the number of axes needed to explain the variance in activity of a neural population
across its inputs. Theoretical neuroscience has demonstrated that the dimensionality of a neural population
determines a fundamental computational trade-off. A low dimensional representation will discard irrelevant
information and form abstractions over its inputs. It is therefore suitable for generalization to new situations. A
high dimensional representation encodes multiple mixtures of inputs into highly separable firing patterns
without overlap. Understanding how generalizability and separability relate to cognitive control function
promises gains on some of the most fundamental problems in control, including context-guided behavior,
interference resolution, multitasking, and controlled-to-automatic behavior.
The goal of this research program is to link the computational properties of high dimensional control
representations to cognitive control function. Our overall hypothesis is that PFC forms high dimensional
representations of task features which are needed in behavioral circumstances benefitting from separability.
This hypothesis is motivated by theoretical neuroscience and foundational studies that have tested the
dimensionality of PFC representations in animal models. However, no study in humans has studied high
dimensional codes in PFC and no evidence in any species links dimensionality to cognitive control function.
Through an NINDS R21 (NS108380), we have developed and refined two novel, complementary methods for
estimating representational dimensionality from fMRI and EEG data. Using these approaches, we have found
preliminary evidence that the dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) forms a high dimensional code relative to other brain
areas. We also find evidence from EEG that separability of high dimensional codes improves efficient, flexible
behavior and may aid stable readout. Thus, we build on these initial observations to establish the nature,
functional significance, and temporal dynamics of high dimensional control representations in the human brain."
10816595,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Most methods for identification of sequence variants focus either on broad genomic coverage using whole
genome sequencing (WGS), typically at depths of ~50-fold, or higher depth sequencing of coding regions (the
exome) after enrichment using oligonucleotide hybridization strategies. However, typical WGS strategies miss
most rare (< 5%) sequence variants, while WGS at depths required to identify rare variants can be cost-
prohibitive. Exome sequencing approaches can provide high coverage of coding regions at reasonable cost
but miss the vast majority of mutations that occur outside of coding regions. Besides coding regions, genetic
variation in cis regulatory regions (CREs) can have a major impact on cell and tissue function by altering
expression of critical genes. No general enrichment strategies for high depth CRE sequencing have been
described because different regions of the genome act as CREs in different cell types, necessitating different
sequences to be enriched in each cell lineage. Drawing on the fact that CREs are marked by the same set of
epigenetic marks in different cell types, we will leverage recent epigenetic profiling technologies we created to
develop a new method called varCUT&Tag for high coverage sequencing and identification of rare variants
within CREs and gene bodies (UG3 phase). A critical feature of our approach will be the simultaneous
identification of epigenetic marks surrounding each variant, enabling functional characterization of the effects
of somatic mutations on CRE function. We will also develop a single cell version of this approach, which
includes a single cell RNA sequencing component, allowing the effects of sequence variants on gene
expression to be identified. As a result, we will be able to not only identify rare CRE variants in diverse cell and
tissue types, but we will simultaneously prioritize variants that alter CRE function for future studies. Using this
approach, we will work within the SMaHT network to identify and characterize CRE variants from numerous
human tissues, uncover the effects of variants on tissue heterogeneity and cell lineage (using scVarCUT&Tag),
and engage in collaborative studies within the Network to increase variant discovery (all UH3 phase). In sum,
varCUT&Tag will fill a major gap in our understanding of somatic sequence variants and provide mechanistic
insight into their effects in diverse human tissues."
10853040,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Persons of color (POC) from underserved communities are at increased risk of COVID-19 related morbidity
and mortality due to a variety of social and structural health determinants (SSDH; e.g., barriers to health care
access) and higher rates of underlying chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular
disease. Additionally, stressors associated with experiences of racism/discrimination (personal and systemic)
and the impact of the pandemic on their communities may further complicate the recovery and management of
underlying chronic diseases for minority COVID-19 survivors, undermining the mental and physical health not
only of the patient but carepartners who provide critical support. This study tests the efficacy of a telehealth-
enhanced, RN-Community Health Worker (CHW) delivered dyad intervention, ICINGS FAM (Integrating
Community-based Intervention Under Nurse Guidance with Families), on quality of life (QoL), and health-
related outcomes in vulnerable African American (AA) adults with preexisting chronic illness and their informal
carepartners (IC). Adapted from our previous WISSDOM CINGs model tested in AA stroke patients, key
features of this intervention include a)
strategies to address racial- and pandemic-related stressors perceived
by COVID-19 survivors and ICs; and b) incorporation of the survivor/IC dyad as a unit of analysis to better
understand how interpersonal and interdependent relationships impact health and health related outcomes for
both partners. We hypothesize that survivor/IC dyads receiving the intervention (i.e., coaching related to
COVID-19 risk mitigation, chronic disease management information, and assistance navigating the health care
system) will demonstrate improved QoL and health-related secondary outcomes compared to the attention
control arm receiving monthly general health promotion. The objective of iCINGS FAM is to strengthen the
efficacy and agency of the dyad to manage illness behaviors as an integrated unit, termed ""dyad illness
management. In Aim 1, we will conduct interviews and focus groups with key community stakeholders to refine
iCINGS FAM components to the individual, interpersonal, community, social environment, and SSDH
assets/barriers of study dyads. In Aim 2, we will employ an RCT design to test intervention efficacy on QoL of
adult AA survivors and ICs (250 dyads) with pre-existing chronic health conditions. Intervention effects on
symptoms, dyadic confidence, and social support will also be investigated (Aim 2.1). In Aim 3, we will identify
individual - and family - level social and structural racial trauma exposures and family illness management
behaviors associated with reduced/improved QoL and health outcomes on a subset of dyads (n=50). Finally, to
further contextualize study findings, in Exploratory Aim 4 we will examine associations between outcomes
and community-level SSDH using PhenX structural determinant variables. This intervention has the potential to
reduce health disparities and increase understanding of SSDH, sociodemographic and psychosocial factors
that affect QoL and dyadic illness management behaviors in minority patients."

Both ethnic diversity and the burden of osteoporosis have increased with the aging US population. Asians now
comprise 7% of the US and 17% of California’s population, the state in which nearly one third of all US Asians
reside. In 2002, the US Preventive Services Task Force updated recommendations for osteoporosis screening
to all women age 65 years and older. Because Asians have lower bone density than whites, they have a
greater likelihood of being diagnosed with osteoporosis on the basis of their bone density screening test
results, yet they have a lower risk of hip fracture. Existing fracture risk calculators consider race/ethnicity in
estimating fracture risk, but the inherent assumptions remain largely untested. The most widely used calculator
is FRAX, which provides 10-year risk estimates of hip and any one of four major osteoporotic fractures for
white, black, Hispanic, and Asian race. For US Asians, an adjustment factor (0.5 for women) is applied during
fracture risk calculation, based on epidemiologic studies indicating that US Asian women have a 40-50% lower
incidence of hip fracture than white women. However, data for fractures other than hip are limited for Asians,
and population fracture data by Asian ethnic subgroups are largely lacking. US Asians comprise a
heterogeneous population whose ancestry originates primarily from East, South, and Southeast Asia; in
California, the two largest subgroups are Filipino and Chinese. It is notable that using the same age, gender,
bone density, and clinical profile, FRAX calculators produce different results for US Asian versus Asians in
Hong Kong and Taiwan (both higher), China (similar), and the Philippines (lower). These differences could
stem from differences in fracture epidemiology in these countries. A more precise understanding of fracture
risk in US Asians is paramount for tailoring their fracture prevention counseling and care.
Using data from Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large integrated healthcare delivery system with
membership across Northern California and especially in the San Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento regions
(where large numbers of Asians reside), this proposed study will conduct the first large-scale assessment of
bone density and fracture outcomes among US Asians and Asian ethnic minorities. Our three primary aims
are: (1) to compare the incidence of hip and major osteoporotic fractures for white and Asian men and women
and by Asian ethnic minorities; (2) to characterize the association between bone density and fracture risk for
Asian women in relation to findings observed for white women; and (3) to examine the predictive accuracy of
fracture risk tools for Asian women and to determine whether replacement of existing base population fracture
data with Asian-specific fracture data yields more accurate fracture risk prediction for Asians. Findings from
this study will provide a more accurate way to calculate fracture risk in US Asians and, in the future, could
enable millions of Asian Americans to obtain fracture risk data tailored to their ethnic profile."

Single-cell genome-wide profiling enabled by next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been fundamentally
changing how molecular biology is studied. Cells are basic unit of life and profiling each individual cell
provides the most accurate and precise characterization of tissue samples that likely contain numerous diverse
cell types and subpopulations. In this project, we will develop high-throughput and high-quality single-cell
technologies based on droplet microfluidics for mapping genome-wide histone modifications and conducting
multi-omic profiling that integrates epigenomic and transcriptomic analyses. Our single-cell ChIP-seq and multi-
omic technology will allow massive number of cells to be examined rapidly. Furthermore, by using drastically
simplified molecular biology and microfluidic technology, our scChIP-seq will produce significantly improved
genome coverage. Our multi-omic profiling will allow integrative analysis of epigenomic and transcriptomic
features and establishment of correlations between gene regulation and expression for precise understanding
of cell type, fate and potential at the single cell level. As a proof-of-principle, we will apply these technologies to
examine the effects of psychedelic drug on mouse brain biology. Brain is the most complex organ that exhibit
enormous heterogeneity and complexity in terms of the cell types and subpopulations involved and studies of
brain neuroscience will benefit from the single-cell approach tremendously. By the end of this 4-year project,
we will push these technologies to maturity for tissue-based studies with real biomedical relevance."

SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory tract infection associated with an extensive cytokine storm. Focal and segmental
glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and diabetic nephropathy (DN) are established risk factors for COVID-19
complications. Whereas both diseases can be exacerbated under cytokine storm conditions, the effect of COVID-
19 associated cytokine storm on the course of established FSGS and DN is not clear. We expect FSGS and DN
to be worsened after COVID-19 infection. Based on human observational data, we generated multiple cytokine
cocktails to mimic the COVID-19 cytokine storm, and showed that they cause multisystem injury when injected
in rodents at high dose (severe COVID-19 in patients), and worsen kidney injury at low dose (mild COVID-19 in
patients). Studying the effect of COVID-19 cytokine storm in animal models of glomerular disease will allow a
better understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on patient with existing disorders. Furthermore, neutralizing the
cytokine storm could potentially improve the outcome of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and prevent worsening
of kidney function by using a combination of receptor blockage and cytokine depletion
In Specific Aim 1, the applicant will study worsening of glomerular disease and chronic kidney disease due to
FSGS and DN after induction of COVID-19 like cytokine storm.
In Specific Aim 2, the applicant will assess the impact of allergy pathway cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, and
inflammatory pathway cytokine TNF-α, and chemokine CXCL5 released during COVID-19 respiratory infection
on pre-existing glomerular diseases.
In Specific Aim 3, the applicant will treat COVID-19 related worsening of glomerular disease and chronic kidney

 Several clinical variables are associated with outcomes following ischemic stroke (IS). However, clinical
and demographic parameters account only for a portion of the outcome variance, thus it is difficult for clinicians
to reliably predict long-term IS outcome. Hence, new biomarkers are needed. Molecules in blood are also
associated with IS outcome including pro-inflammatory cytokines, anti-inflammatory cytokines and others.
Genetic risk factors have also been associated with IS outcome. Unfortunately, combined blood and genetic
biomarkers have not improved IS outcome predictions compared to clinical parameters since age, sex and
initial NIHSS is said to predict outcome with a modest c-statistic approaching 0.7. Our preliminary data show
gene expression in blood after IS can predict 90-day outcome better than age, sex and NIHSS. We
hypothesize that a whole-genome approach of measuring RNA, which reflects the genome × environment ×
lifestyle interaction, to assess inflammatory, trophic and clotting genes will improve IS outcome prediction
compared to clinical features alone. Thus, we propose the following aims: Aim #1a. Perform whole-genome
RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of blood on a derivation cohort of IS patients at 1 day and 3 days after IS
compared to matched vascular risk factor controls (VRFC). Aim #1b. Identify the most significantly regulated
genes and pathways in blood at 1d/3d after IS that correlate with outcome, as measured by three outcome
scales – mRS (modified Rankin Scale), NIHSS (NIH Stroke Scale) and Barthel Index at 90 days after IS. Aim
#1c. Use Network Analysis to identify key hub genes after IS associated with outcome that might be causative.
Aim #1d. Use Feature Engineering and Logistic Regression and/or other Machine Learning approaches, such
as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and SVM Regression, to identify the least number of genes at 1 and/or 3
days that predict the three stroke 90-day outcome measures. Aim #1e. In a separate validation cohort of IS
patients perform RNAseq to obtain the expression of the biomarker genes from Aim #1d. Input these into
Machine Learning algorithms to predict patient 90-day outcomes (mRS, NIHSS, Barthel Index). Aim #2a.
Demonstrate that gene expression is a better 90-day outcome predictor compared to each or a combination of
clinical variables, such as stroke volume, initial NIHSS, location, etiology, age, sex, glucose levels, blood
pressure, atrial fibrillation, and neutrophil, monocyte, lymphocyte, and platelet counts. Aim #2b. Delineate the
underlying biology of these clinical outcome contributors by identifying genes and networks that correlate with
them and pinpoint which of the genes/networks also correlate with each of the three outcomes.
Significance: The findings of this study will develop biomarkers of ischemic stroke outcome to help clinicians
predict IS outcome and aid future clinical trials in stratifying IS patients, thus significantly increasing chances
for trial success. Equally important, the findings will provide much needed potential new treatment targets and
unprecedented knowledge of how the peripheral blood transcriptome contributes to outcome and improve our
understanding of the biology of repair and recovery after IS in humans."

Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) remains the leading cause of post-neonatal mortality in the U.S.– an
unchanging and devastating fact despite implementation of safe sleep practices (extrinsic risk reduction).
Addressing this 21st century health crisis now requires discovery of intrinsic biological vulnerabilities and
plausible molecular pathways that might lead to biomarkers and preventative interventions. In multiple
independent SIDS tissue datasets, serotonergic (5-HTergic) abnormalities in the brainstem were consistently
identified; in animal models of reduced brainstem 5-HTergic activity, compromised autoresuscitation (AR) was
observed – the ability of mouse pups to recover from cycles of asphyxial apneas and bradycardia (resembling
the cycles of apnea and bradycardia observed in some SIDS cases) was significantly diminished. Such 5-
HTergic system dysfunction, as an intrinsic vulnerability, may be caused or exacerbated by extrinsic stressors
such as pre- and/or postnatal hypoxia (e.g., placental insufficiency, parental smoking) and/or antemortem
infections. Hypoxia and infection are each risk factors for SIDS and can increase neuroinflammation, which can
impair AR. Notable new findings in some SIDS cases as compared to controls are elevations of the
neuroinflammatory markers IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-17, and GM-CSF and/or in neopterin (a marker of Th1
(proinflammatory) cellular activation) in the cerebrospinal fluid. We postulate that neuroinflammation,
triggered by hypoxia and/or antemortem infections (bacterial or viral), interact to create a vulnerable 5-
HTergic system, reduce AR effectiveness, and increase the risk for sudden death, and may underlie
some SIDS cases. We propose: 1) To quantitate inflammatory mediators within SIDS brains and determine
whether a profile of mediators associates with 5-HTergic brainstem abnormalities. We will test the hypothesis
that specific inflammatory profiles associate with low 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor binding and low 5-HT levels. 2)
To map at single-cell resolution, differences in gene expression profiles and overall cell-type composition/states
of brainstem tissue across SIDS cases (the SIDS subsets identified through Aim 1) and controls. We hypothesize
that SIDS subsets will be distinguished by specific inflammatory profiles in glia, neurons, and/or endothelial cells,
and gene expression differences will identify novel, previously unrecognized SIDS-related pathways for
mechanistic testing in cell and animal models. 3) Assess the interaction between chronic intermittent hypoxia
(gestational to P8) and postnatal antemortem infection on molecular, cellular, inflammatory, and physiological
readouts, including the autoresuscitation response (AR). We will test the hypothesis that the combined effects
of antemortem hypoxia and infection interact to create greater neuroinflammation, more severe 5-HTergic
deficits, and increased likelihood of AR failure, compared to either hypoxia or infection alone. SIDS research
must address the missing mechanistic links between risk factors and postmortem pathology to develop life-
saving interventions."

 This research program seeks to describe and understand striatal dopamine (DA) signals, particularly in
the nucleus accumbens (NAc). NAc DA is a key regulator of both motivation and reward-related learning, and
drugs of abuse share the common property of enhancing NAc DA. Yet we lack a clear account of how DA
signals arise, how they are shaped by local NAc circuits, and how they modulate NAc output to influence
behavior. Our Aims for the next funding period address three specific aspects of DA signals that are currently
under active debate:
 First, why are NAc DA signals different to those in other parts of striatum? We found that NAc DA
evolves more slowly compared to dorsal areas, and shows a distinct response profile to reward-predictive
cues. We hypothesize that neural circuits involving NAc generate reward predictions and motivation over
longer time horizons. Using retrograde optogenetic tagging, we will compare the firing patterns of individual DA
cells that project to NAc subregions and other striatal areas, testing whether they define a temporal topography
of reward expectation and feedback.
 Second, does NAc DA release convey signals beyond those encoded in the firing of afferent DA cells?
We showed that changing the available reward for a behavioral task influences rats' willingness to work, and
alters NAc DA release, without any apparent change in DA cell firing. We will investigate whether motivation-
related changes in DA are instead sculpted by local cholinergic interneurons. To do this we will combine real-
time DA and ACh measurements, selective pharmacological agents, and optogenetic tagging of cholinergic
cells.
 Third, how do increases in DA release rapidly boost motivation? This is generally thought to involve
enhanced firing of NAc output neurons that express the D1 DA receptor, relative to those expressing the D2
receptor. However, some recent results suggest that both populations increase activity, while computational
models have cast doubt on whether DA can modulate cells quickly enough to explain observed behavioral
effects. To resolve this we will record the spiking of identified NAc D1+ and D2+ output neurons, while also
measuring and manipulating DA, at key behavioral moments.
 In each case we will take advantage of recent technical advances in optical chemical sensors, and of
our ability to record the firing of individual identified neurons in freely-moving rats. We will use multiple
carefully-controlled behavioral tasks, including an innovative new maze task in which rats display a trade-off
between expected reward and required effort. Together these studies will provide vital new results for our
understanding of NAc DA functions, along with rich, publicly-available data sets for the research community."

 Recent advance in the prevention and treatment of breast cancer significantly increase the survival of breast
cancer patients. It will be highlighted that with the increased survival of breast cancer patients, however, the
incidence of latent breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) significantly increased. BCBM is one of critical factors
that contributes to the lethality of breast cancer patients. Autophagy is important in the initiation and progression
of cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic disorders, and infectious diseases. Nevertheless, the
functions of autophagy in tumor microenvironment, especially the roles of glial autophagy in BCBM, are not
investigated. Using syngeneic mice, we established intracerebral and intracarotid artery injection models for
BCBM with different mouse breast cancer cells. We observed robust astrogliosis, infiltration of microglia, and
uncontrolled growth of malignant cells in mouse BCBM models. More importantly, we found increased autophagy
in reactive astrocytes but not in neurons at the borders of brain-breast cancers. Using brain specific Fip200 (an
autophagy essential gene) conditional knock out mice, we revealed the indispensable functions of autophagy in
astrocytes for the initiation and progression of BCBM. Breast cancer cells activated Stat3 to initiate brain
metastasis, the process of which depended on intact autophagy in tumor microenvironment astrocytes. Moreover,
we confirmed the elevation of autophagy in astrocytes and activation of Stat3 in cancer cells in dissected human
samples, suggesting a correlation of our experimental observation with clinical importance. Our results indicated
a previously unrecognized mechanism for astrocytes in tumor microenvironment to support the initiation and
growth of breast cancer cells in brain. To facilitate mechanistic studies, we generated a coculture model using
human breast cancer cell lines with human embryonic stem cells derived cerebral organoids. Our data indicated
that the metastatic human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells could colonize in cerebral organoids while the non-
metastatic MCF-7 cells could not grow. In this proposal, we will determine the molecular mechanisms by which
autophagy in astrocytes is utilized by breast cancer for brain metastasis, using a combination of molecular
biology, cell tracing method, brain injections, stem cell technology, and mouse genetic approaches. Our
proposed studies will have significant impact on understanding the fundamental mechanisms of reactive
astrocytes to regulate BCBMs. Our research will raise new translational approach for stratification and treatment
of BCBM patients. The results in our research might also shed light on the investigation of tumor
microenvironment for other brain metastatic cancers and primary brain tumors."

 Allergic diseases including asthma, eczema, and food allergy have increased substantially over the last
few decades. These diseases affect almost 5% of the population and having an annual economic burden of over
80 billion dollars. Allergic reactions can be life-threatening. While we have learned much about how an allergic
reaction occurs, much remains unknown about how allergies develop. Genetic predisposition is important in
developing allergies, but few defined mutations in specific genes are known to cause allergic disease.
 Recently, we conducted an allergy screen in mutagenized mice to discover genes that regulate
production of allergen-specific IgE, which mediates allergic reactions. Among several phenotypes of interest,
benadryl is marked by 90% reduced IgE levels and resistance to anaphylaxis with otherwise normal immunity.
benadryl was ascribed to a mutation a gene that produces mannose used for glycosylation (adding sugars to
proteins), metabolism and targeting proteases to the lysosome. IgE glycosylation is important for its structure
and function.
 Therefore (1), we will determine how the benadryl mutation affects IgE by identifying the cell type
responsible for low IgE through a combination of in vitro cell assays and conditional knock-out mouse models.
To determine the effect of altered mannose (2), we will examine alterations to IgE glycosylation, stability, and
function along with measuring changes to metabolism and lysosomal trafficking. To assess the importance of
benadryl in allergic disease (3), we will determine whether benadryl mice are resistant to IgE mediated
anaphylaxis and food allergy.
 Upon successful completion, the findings of this study will reveal a new pathway important for IgE
production that would be an appealing therapeutic target. I plan to use these results to launch my career using
this mouse strain to understand how altered IgE glycosylation regulates IgE stability, clearance and function.
Few other investigators are exploring this topic, which will allow me to study this into the future independently
without overlap with my current mentor’s line of scientific investigation.
 My career goal is to be an independent physician scientist determining the genes that regulate IgE
production, which can be clinically translated to genetic tests and potential therapeutic targets. This career
development award will help me gain skills in molecular biology, animal models of allergy, cellular immunology,
and proteomics. Biannual meetings with my mentoring committee will guide early career milestones including
submission of multiple papers. Institutional grant writing resources will be used to successfully compete for an

Combining high-throughput biomedical data sets from multiple studies is advantageous to increase statistical
power in studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or require the sequential generation of data.
However, significant technical heterogeneity is commonly observed across multiple batches of data that are
generated from different processing or reagent batches, experimenters, protocols, or profiling platforms. These
so-called batch effects confound true relationships in the data, reducing the power benefits of combining multiple
batches of data, and may even lead to spurious results. Many methods have been proposed to filter technical
heterogeneity from genomic data. These methods are designed to remove batch effects, unmeasured or
“surrogate” variation, or other “unwanted” variation caused by biological or technical sources. Although these
approaches represent impactful advances in the field, there are still significant gaps that need to be addressed
to appropriately filter technical heterogeneity from -omics data and other high-throughput datasets. For example,
many existing methods assume relevant covariates are known or that raw data are generally independent. Some
applications require more specific and direct correction methods, including single cell transcriptomics data that
are often missing cell-type identifiers, microbiome data that are compositional in nature, and imaging and spatial
transcriptomics data that have spatially correlated data points. Furthermore, batch correction introduces
correlation into the adjusted data, which needs to be accounted for in downstream analyses, and most
researchers performing batch correction are unaware of this negative impact and often incorrectly apply
downstream analysis tools. Finally, there is still significant need for additional software tools and benchmark
datasets for evaluating batch effect methods and their efficacy in specific datasets. We propose to develop
algorithms and software to address these specific research gaps facing researchers combining data from
multiple experimental batches."

After damage to white matter tracts (WMI) in CNS diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) in adults and
newborn brain injuries that cause cerebral palsy (CP), myelin sheaths can be regenerated by activated
oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). Failure of this remyelination program often occurs due to the improper
recruitment of OPCs into injury sites, contributing significantly to ongoing neurological dysfunction and disease
progression. Understanding the mechanisms controlling OPC biology during remyelination will provide insights
as to why myelin repair fails in human cases. Importantly, OPCs dynamically produce primary cilia, microtubule-
based organelles that transduce intercellular cues in a specialized signaling compartment. The role of primary
cilia in regulating developmental pathways in OPCs remains poorly understood. Here, we show that OPCs
require primary cilia to respond properly to WMI. First, this grant will demonstrate that genetically removing
primary cilia from OPCs results in inadequate WMI repair, identifying the primary cilium as a critical
effector of biological change in OPCs necessary for the WMI response. Furthermore, as there remains little
mechanistic understanding of ciliary signaling pathways in OPCs, we will use a combination of approaches that
ultimately define a GPCR/cAMP/CREB signaling axis beginning at the primary cilium as a crucial regulator
of OPC biology. Finally, with recent advances in proximity-labeling, we can now catalogue the proteins that
survey OPC primary cilia using a technique termed cilia-APEX. This grant will utilize cilia-APEX to identify
signaling molecules that localize to OPC primary cilia in vitro and during remyelination in vivo. This will
demonstrate dynamic changes in the protein content of OPC primary cilia during different stages of
remyelination, while also adding significant insight into the extent of ciliary functions in OPCs. Together, these
studies will show that primary cilia are a critical signaling module in OPCs for the regulation of remyelination,
and will reveal potential therapeutic target for conditions such as MS and CP, where the OPC response to injury
can be dysfunctional.

10862675,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer that is recalcitrant to
molecular targeted therapies and accounts for about 200,000 new diagnoses per year worldwide.
Immunomodulators, therapies that harness the immune system against cancer, have revolutionized the
treatment of some cancers and have recently been approved for treatment of TNBC. Disappointingly, TNBC
patient response to these therapies has been heterogeneous and significantly lower than other types of cancers.
 TNBCs are notoriously immunologically cold, with relatively low levels of baseline immune infiltration
limiting the efficacy of immunomodulators that amplify productive antitumor immune response. Therefore, a great
deal of effort has been focused on promoting immune engagement in these tumors. We have previously shown
that oncogenic aberrations common in TNBC result in hypersensitivity to perturbation of the RNA splicing
machinery. Importantly, multiple studies, including our own (Bowling, Wang, et al. 2021), have revealed that
therapeutic efficacy of spliceosome-targeted therapies (STTs) is in part due to engaging the host immune
system. While these discoveries hold great promise for clinical deployment of STTs, especially in combination
with immunomodulators, several aspects of their role in activation of antitumor immunity require further
understanding. Herein, we propose to interrogate the species of mis-spliced RNA that trigger viral mimicry and
trigger tumor inflammation and antitumor immunity.
Aim 1. Investigate combinatorial therapy approaches based on STT-induced antitumor immune
response. Our preliminary data indicate that activation of tumor-intrinsic antiviral signaling by STT treatment
modifies interaction with the tumor microenvironment. By leveraging a diverse cohort of immune-competent
syngeneic models of TNBC, we will elucidate the STT-induced change in immune infiltrate and evaluate
treatment in combination with immunomodulators to enhance the efficacy of STTs.
Aim 2: Define cellular modulators of endogenous dsRNA-mediated antiviral signaling. Prominent
oncogenic aberrations have been shown to modulate baseline and agonist-induced inflammatory signaling in
tumor cells. Indeed, we have observed heterogeneity in antiviral transcriptional response across a panel of TNBC
cell lines with STT-induced dsRNA accumulation. Thus, we will leverage an interferon reporter-based genetic
screen to identify novel regulators of cell-intrinsic immune response to endogenous dsRNA accumulation.
Aim 3: Evaluate features of STT-induced mis-spliced RNA that stimulate antiviral signaling. Preliminary
studies indicate that distinct chemotypes of STTs being investigated in the clinical setting result in differential
antiviral immune signaling. Using chemical genetic perturbation and novel RNA labeling and sequencing
methods, we will profile immunogenic misprocessed RNA generated by perturbation of distinct spliceosome
components encompassing the entirety of the RNA splicing cycle."

Stroke is a leading cause of disability in the United States. While there have been advancements in
neurorehabilitation strategies, many patients continue to suffer from chronic disability, underscoring the need
for further research into novel approaches to rehabilitation. Sleep remains relatively understudied in stroke
studies even though there is evidence that lack of sleep following a stroke worsens neurological symptoms and
long-term outcomes. Thus, sleep may be a useful target in developing new rehabilitation strategies. We
propose to study the cortical and cerebellar regions during sleep to elucidate the systems-level neural
processing that is linked to performance gains during the recovery period. Our recent work has shown that
non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep processing in the motor cortex (M1) of healthy rats is linked to
performance improvements in a motor task. Additionally, it is widely acknowledged that motor learning of
clinically important and continuous movements has cerebellar correlates. Interestingly, recent work has shown
that NREM sleep spindles have a cerebellar origin. Sleep spindles are widely known to be involved in
reactivating awake learning activity, but these studies have more commonly focused on the neocortex,
hippocampus, and thalamus. However, the extent to which NREM spindle oscillations in the cerebellum
covary with the spindle oscillations in the neocortical regions (and if they reactivate awake single neuronal
activity in both regions) during sleep to improve performance remains incompletely understood. Moreover, it is
key to understand the sleep stages and accompanying neurophysiology that support post-stroke motor
recovery in these structures, as well as the extent to which they can be modulated to enhance recovery. In this
proposal, we take a systems-level approach to: (i) understand the coordinated NREM sleep processes in
cortico-cerebellar networks that are associated with motor learning/ recovery in intact and stroke-injured rats,
specifically if spindle activity is temporally locked in these regions; (ii) establish necessity of NREM sleep-
related neural processing in skill consolidation and recovery through optogenetics; and (iii) test if augmentation
of these sleep-related neural events using electrical stimulation of cerebellum enhances recovery. We will use
simultaneous large-scale electrophysiologic monitoring of cortico-cerebellar networks with electrical stimulation
and optogenetics in a rodent stroke model to test the following hypothesis: coupled NREM sleep activity in the
intact and ipsilesional spared M1 and contralateral cerebellar cortex underlies motor learning or recovery after
stroke, learning is reduced when this synchronization is disrupted via optogenetic inhibition of the cerebellar
activity, and learning is increased when this synchronization is boosted via electrical stimulation of the
cerebellum."

The discovery of antibiotics in the early 20th century opened up a new era of medical treatment. Indeed, many
present-day infections that are easily treated could have had deadly consequences in the absence of antibiotics.
The overuse of these medicines has been a concern in the recent years due to the selection pressures that have
allowed resistant bacterial species to emerge. However, another untoward consequence of antibiotics is that
treatment can alter the commensal organisms of the body, which we now understand has important homeostatic
functions. Indeed, many bacterial, fungal, and viral organisms that live within tissues of the body can condition
the immunologic system, and an altered microbiome, such as with antibiotic use, can contribute to the
development of many acute and chronic pathologies. As such, our studies demonstrate that giving prophylactic
antibiotics during influenza infection (a common clinical practice) increases the risk for development of a
secondary bacterial pneumonia, which is major reason for the morbidity and mortality from the initial viral illness.
Although antibiotics have direct effects on decreasing the abundance and diversity of the bacterial microbiome,
the newly available niche with reduced nutritional competition provides an opportunity for expansion of fungal
communities. Our data demonstrates that fungal dysbiosis is a driver of worsened secondary bacteria pneumonia
after influenza infection. Moreover, we find that antibiotic-induced fungal dysbiosis increases lung inflammation
including augmented interferon-γ levels, a cytokine that can clear detrimental effects that contribute to post-
influenza bacterial pneumonia. Finally, we find that eosinophils partially modulate the augmented lung injury,
and increased gut S. cerevisiae correlates with the phenotype induced by fungal dysbiosis. Altogether, these
findings support our central hypothesis that antibiotic treatment during influenza infection causes fungal dysbiosis
that has lung immunomodulatory effects, which in turn increases the host susceptibility to bacterial
superinfection. We will test this hypothesis in the following aims:
Aim 1. Determine if fungal dysbiosis alters innate immune functions in post-influenza pneumonia.
Aim 2. Evaluate how fungal dysbiosis causes lung eosinophilia to augment lung inflammation.
Aim 3. Investigate the role of S. cerevisiae in mediating lung injury from post-influenza MRSA pneumonia."
10930865,"The long-term goal of this project is to ameliorate neurotransmission defects due to mitochondrial dysfunction,
as a way to stop disease progression to later degenerative stages, increasing healthspan in populations
increasingly subject to age-related neurological diseases. Dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) acts to promote
mitochondrial fission and has been identified as a therapeutic target for limiting aberrant mitochondrial
fragmentation in Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s disease. The goal of this project is to determine how DRP1
interaction with mitochondrial fission adapters impacts presynaptic terminal function. We propose that the need
for high levels of mitochondrial respiration to support synaptic transmission makes the presynaptic terminal a
high cellular stress environment. Regulated mitochondrial fission is important for cell survival in response to
cellular stressors, acting through DRP1, but the adapters utilized at the neuronal presynaptic terminal are
unknown. In Specific Aim 1, we will examine how loss of the mitochondrial fission adapter proteins MFF and
FIS1 affect mitochondria homeostasis and synaptic transmission. In Specific Aim 2, we will examine distinct
parameters of mitochondrial function and ultrastructure when DRP1 is eliminated, and attempt to rescue function
by targeting DRP1 re-expression to mitochondrial outer membrane. Phenotypic differences will be corelated with
those in Aim 1, to generate a complete picture of the effect of regulated mitochondrial fission on synaptic function.
DRP1 may also facilitate scission of plasma membrane at the synapse, but the impact of this additional function
on synaptic transmission is unresolved. In Specific Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that DRP1 facilitates
synaptic vesicle retrieval and recycling, and determine whether membrane-associated DRP1 is sufficient to
facilitate SV retrieval, and restore synaptic transmission. In collaboration, the PI and two other world-class
investigators have developed novel approaches to allow dissection of the isoform-specific role(s) of DRP1, using
the mouse calyx of Held as a model system. Using a combination of viral-mediated transgenesis, advanced
electrophysiology, and high-resolution light and electron microscopy, the ability of specific DRP1 isoforms to
support mitochondrial fission versus synaptic transmission and presynaptic SV retrieval will be systematically
tested. In contrast to small conventional synapses, experimental accessibility of giant ‘calyx-like’ excitatory
synapses allow recordings from the presynaptic terminal, permitting manipulation of presynaptic [ATP] and
tracking membrane exo/endocytosis in real time. This approach is necessary to dissect the energy-supporting
roles of synaptic mitochondria from mechanisms underlying synaptic vesicle recycling. Results from this project
can be used to inform, predict, and test function and dysfunction at conventional glutamatergic synapses where
disease-relevant neurodegeneration first appears. Knowledge generated from this project will identify viable
routes of intervention for restoring function to synapses where DRP1 function is altered, which can be leveraged
therapeutically to alleviate disease-related synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration."

The management of dopamine resistant postural instability and gait difficulties (PIGD) features, such as falls,
represents perhaps the most important unmet clinical need in persons with Parkinson's disease (PD) and is a
major cause for reduced quality of life. The loss of functional abilities and quality of life associated with the
emergence of PIGD is further compromised by coinciding emergence of cognitive decline and dementia. This
may reflect progressive non-dopaminergic pathologies, such as cholinergic system changes. Vestibular
impairment, in particular more chronic bilateral vestibular dysfunction of older age (defined as
presbyvestibulopathy, PVP), is a significant contributor to imbalance and falls in older US adults. Unlike acute
vestibular disorders that are sporadic, PVP is also common in an age-associated disorder like PD. We have
novel preliminary data showing that the presence of PVP in PD is associated with imbalance independent from
nigrostriatal dopaminergic losses. Using a data-driven whole brain selection method of vesicular acetylcholine
transporter (VAChT) [18F]FEOBV PET brain regions, we also found that the presence of PVP in PD is
associated with cholinergic system changes most prominently in the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN) and by
medial temporal lobe structures involved in multimodal sensory processing, spatial orientation and navigation.
Lower cholinergic binding in the MGN and a composite measure of cholinergic binding in PVP-related specific
brain regions associated with presence of imbalance in people with PD. Given recent recognition of important
vestibular information processing functions of the MGN, our data suggest that this small metathalamic nucleus
may function as a key node in the central vestibular neural network. These observations in people with PD may
also be relevant for non-PD older adults with PVP. Cholinergic and dopaminergic losses not only occur in PD
but are also part of normal aging starting from young adulthood on. We have preliminary data showing that
age-associated vulnerability of cholinergic nerve terminal losses is most conspicuous in the MGN and
mesiotemporal lobe. This suggests that cholinergic vulnerability of normal aging may contribute to the
relationship between PVP and cholinergic system changes in PD. Conversely, age-associated vulnerability in
these structures may explain the high and increasing prevalence of PVP in non-PD older persons. We propose
to perform brain cholinergic [18F]FEOBV and dopamine transporter [11C]PE2I PET imaging and balance
assessment and vestibular testing in persons with PD and non-PD older adults. The overarching goal of this
study is to test the hypothesis that brain region-specific cholinergic system changes associate with the
presence of both PVP and fall status in persons with PD independent of dopaminergic losses. We also
propose to test the secondary hypothesis that age-associated cholinergic vulnerability in the MGN and
mediotemporal lobe associate with the presence of both PVP and fall status in non-PD older adults
independent of dopaminergic losses of normal aging."
10892229,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Cannabis use disorders (CUD) are prevalent in the U.S., and highly comorbid with other substance use
disorders (SUD) such as alcohol use disorder (AUD), as well as with other mental health problems. While the
etiology of cannabis use/misuse have both environmental and genetic components, cannabis use and
problematic use are found to be highly heritable. Thus, studies that identify the genetic risk factors for CUD in
the general U.S. populations, and in the high-risk populations, are of high public health importance. However,
the genetic factors identified in the human genome thus far by conventional methods are sparse and appear to
have only captured a very small fraction of the overall heritability for the disorder. One key challenge in
addiction genetics is how to identify genetic interactions and epistatic regulations that may play a more
important role in determining risk for addictive behaviors than what gene variants do individually, and that may
help explain a critical part of the missing link. Genetic interactions have rarely been systematically considered
in studies of substance use, primarily due to lack of statistical power and shortage of computational
methodology. To address the challenge, we propose a framework to systematically detect disease-relevant
context specific genetic pathway interactions that underlie the risk for SUD. The framework will be applied to
CUD and comorbid AUD to identify crucial genetic interactions and pleiotropic interactions, filling a critical gap
in uncovering the genetic architectures of CUD. We will leverage genetic network and pathway topology and
integrate multiple layers of omics including genomics, transcriptomic and epigenomic signals in drug abuse
relevant tissues. By sharpening the focus on the functionally connected gene and regulation subsets through a
priori analyses, we will be able to dramatically boost the statistical power to detect genetic interactions, arrive
at highly biologically relevant and readily interpretable findings, and potentially provide clinically actionable
insights. The proposed study will utilize outcomes from large GWAS studies for CUD and AUD, together with
three high-risk population cohorts with elevated levels of severe cannabis and alcohol use disorders that have
whole genome sequence data. We will complement the context specific pathway-level interaction analysis with
high-dimensional variable screening machine-learning algorithms to identify both low and high order genetic
interactions and regulatory epistatic effects associated with CUD. The findings that are carefully validated
using independent study cohorts will be incorporated into a larger disease model of CUD for prediction and
potential intervention, and will open up new avenues of research by allowing interrogation of the addiction
genetics from a system’s level. The framework will be build in such a way that is readily transferable to other
SUD and mental health studies and sets the stage for a genetically and epigenetically informed, precision
medicine approach to SUD prevention and treatment. All software developed in the program will be freely
available to the research community."

Alzheimer’s disease and associated dementias are major public health challenges with a multifold increase in
prevalence expected in the coming decades. Alzheimer’s disease is increasingly recognized as having network-
level effects and interactions. In this project, we will develop a deep learning model to learn the latent
representation of functional neuroimaging, in order to disentangle the underlying sources and better reconstruct
the data.
Deep learning approaches in fMRI have faced a common challenge on generalizability and explainability. To
address these issues, the system will learn representations that can be decoded and interpreted as spatial
patterns and temporal dynamics of brain networks; and be readily generalizable to different subjects, brain
states, behavioral tasks, and disease conditions without a need to redesign or retrain the system from scratch.
The proposed focus on Alzheimer’s disease is the first step in exploiting this notion for clinical application.
We will leverage both publicly available large data (e.g., Human Connectome Project-Aging, Alzheimer’s Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative) as well as the well-characterized longitudinal cohort of the NIA P30-funded Michigan
Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (MADRC); this cohort undergoes annual neurological and
neuropsychological evaluations and is particularly unique since it consists of ~45% African Americans. This
research is particularly relevant for ethnic minority populations since African Americans are almost twice as likely
to develop cognitive decline as Non-Hispanic white Americans; yet most of what has been learned about
dementia biomarkers is based on study samples that are primarily Non-Hispanic white Americans.
The overall goal of this project is to develop an enhanced deep learning model for improved data representation,
subtype classification and prediction of clinical behavioral measures and apply it to the domain of mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) and dementia of the Alzheimer’s Type (DAT)."
10813848,"The goal of the NIDDK Innovative Science Accelerator (ISAC) program is to not only provide funding for highly
innovative hypothesis driven research but to deliver a platform for the KUH research community to collaborate,
exchange ideas and find resources that will accelerate innovation in areas of interest to that community. Our
laboratory has extensive experience in developing these types of resources and managing the activities of
national consortia. We are currently the Coordinating Units (CU) for two NIDDK consortia, the Mouse
Metabolic Phenotyping Centers (MMPC) and the Diabetic Complications Consortium (DiaComp). Both
consortia are NIDDK funded initiatives that provide an environment to foster communication and collaboration
between investigator communities involved in metabolic and diabetic complications research. Each sponsors
annual meetings in relevant scientific areas, solicits and funds pilot projects in high impact areas of NIDDK
research, and supports websites to serve their respective scientific communities. Over the last 14 years, our
group has developed an extensive infrastructure to successfully managed the coordinating units (CU) for these
NIDDK funded consortia (MMPC, 2006-present, DiaComp, 2011-present). The ISAC-CU will be responsible for
supporting ISAC investigators through the use of opportunity pools (funding programs), manage/maintain the
website/resources and administratively organize the meetings and workshops sponsored by ISAC to engage
the greater KUH scientific community. The ISAC-CU is responsible for creating and maintaining the
administrative, scientific and informatics infrastructure necessary to organize and facilitate ISAC’s operations.
The goal of this proposal is to provide that infrastructure. We will build upon the success of the current CU
infrastructure to provide ISAC with a robust and comprehensive service oriented solution that supports the
unique aspects of this consortium."

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tuberculosis) is the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB); although a treatable
disease TB remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. This in large is driven by the
unparalleled increase in anti- mycobacterial drug resistance. Approximately 10 million people fell ill with TB
in 2019, where 500 000 were new rifampicin resistant cases and 78% of rifampicin cases were multi-drug
resistant; compromising the most effective first-line drugs. In line with recent WHO guidance, the majority of
these patients are treated with all-oral short-course treatment incorporating bedaquiline and other novel
agents. Emerging drug resistance to these novel drugs is a critical threat to expansion of shortened, all-oral,
DR-TB treatment regimens. Current diagnostic assays do not incorporate resistance detection to these new
drugs, largely as a result of our incomplete understanding of the underlying genetic mechanisms mediating
resistance. As a result, a combination of genotypic and phenotypic techniques is required to monitor
resistance to these new drugs. Reporter mycobacteriophage assays represent a promising approach for
deriving phenotypic data in a replication-independent system, maintaining high sensitivity while reducing the
time to result attendant with growth-based methods. We created a TM4 phage vector that delivers a gene
cassette of the nanoluciferase (Nluc) reporter enzyme. The TM4-nluc phage was tested on a range of
auxotrophic and virulent clinical M. tuberculosis strains, assessing cellular limit of detection and compatibility
with drug susceptibility testing on a wide range of antimycobacterial drugs. We found that following a
preculture period, we could identify drug susceptibility consistent with WHO-endorsed treatment
concentrations to a suite of first-line and second-line drugs as well as novel and repurposed drugs
(bedaquiline, pretomanid, and linezolid). The overall objective of this research is to validate the
nanoluciferase phage for detection of resistance to novel anti-mycobaterial agents, will be accomplished in
two Aims. Aim 1 will establish the utility of the assay in paucibacillary conditions and mixed infection. Aim2
will derive correlations between established minimum inhibitory values around critical concentrations and
nanoluciferase fluorescence intensity measures, and validate these cut points in a established prospective
cohort study of MDR-TB treatment. An exploratory sub Aim will trial minimally processed sputum rather than
MTB culture for MTB detection and drug susceptibility testing. The proposed work will provide additional
validation on the TM4-nluc phage system and offer a quantitative phenotypic reference method and
complement to genotypic methods for diagnosis and antibiotic susceptibility testing."
10923808,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: USC TCORS OVERALL
In response to new FDA landmark policies targeting tobacco products with flavors and other youth-attracting
features, the non-combustible market is evolving in ways that could perpetuate adolescent and young adult
(AYA) use. Shifts to the non-combustible tobacco market include the emergence of modern oral nicotine
products (ONPs; flavored nicotine pouches, non-therapeutic gums, lozenges, gummies) with rapidly increasing
sales, e-cigarettes and ONPs with novel flavors and higher nicotine concentrations (e.g., concept flavors with
ambiguous flavor names that are difficult for the FDA to classify but offer fruity sensations and e-cigarettes with
>6% nicotine), and novel marketing platforms (TikTok and other social media that highly engage AYAs). USC
TCORS responds to these challenges with a theme of “Informing regulation of the evolving market of non-
combustible products to protect young people.” The overall Center specific aims are: Aim 1) Conduct four
interrelated projects that will: (a) determine how modern ONPs and e-cigarettes impact AYA tobacco product
use uptake, escalation, abuse liability, and poly-use patterns across populations; (b) identify product
characteristics and marketing approaches that amplify these impacts; Aim 2) Augment our Center’s infrastructure
with three cores that will optimize the productivity and impact of our regulatory science (Administrative Core,
Measures and Materials Core, Data Processing and Analysis Core); and Aim 3) Develop the next generation of
tobacco regulatory scientists via developing the careers of doctoral and post-doctoral trainees, and investigators
transitioning to tobacco regulatory science (TRS). Collectively, USC TCORS will provide key evidence
determining whether availability of certain non-combustible product classes (e.g., new ONPs), types (e.g.,
products that can be used discreetly), characteristics (e.g., e-cigarettes and ONPs in concept flavors), and
marketing strategies (e.g., social media influencers) increase AYA’s risk of initiating and progressing along the
tobacco use trajectory, including in key AYA subpopulations (e.g., sexual/gender minorities). This research will
directly inform FDA’s responses to numerous e-cigarette, ONP, and other illegally marketed non-combustible
products. It will provide rigorous actionable evidence to guide FDA decisions on pending marketing applications
from tobacco product companies. The data will also inform FDA policies regarding which illegally-marketed
products should be targeted as enforcement priorities. These achievements will build upon our successful USC
TCORS Centers that, since 2013, has published 237 peer reviewed articles (166 of these published since 2018).
Further, we have a substantial track record of: (a) providing foundational evidence informing FDA’s development
of new policies; and (b) rapidly adapting our research to inform FDA revision of previous policies to keep pace
with the evolving market; this is evidenced by 31 citations of TCORS research in FDA policy documents.

10923810,"PROJECT 1: ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Project 1 (P1): Use of Novel Non-Combustible Tobacco Products among US Youth (Leader, Leventhal)
P1 determines how availability of different new non-combustible products impacts tobacco product use in US
youth from 2024-2028. To accomplish this, P1 will: a) partner with the Monitoring the Future (MTF) Study to add
a new survey module focused on tobacco regulatory science (TRS) with its own unique measures to the annual
cross-sectional survey of US 8th, 10th, and 12th graders (n=221,490, pooled across years); b) test hypotheses
about 5-year trends in the use of edible oral nicotine products (ONPs; gums, lozenges/mints, gummies), pouch
ONPs, and e-cigarettes; c) examine the role of ONP and e-cigarette product characteristics and reasons for use
in ONP and e-cigarette use; and d) estimate relations of race/ethnicity, rural residence, mental health, and other
substance use with use and poly-use of ONPs with e-cigarettes and with combustible products. Aim 1 is to
determine the epidemiology of ONP use and poly-use with e-cigarette, combustible, or smokeless tobacco in US
youth, 2024-2028. We hypothesize that: (a) past 30-day use prevalence of any ONP, edible ONPs, or pouch
ONPs will increase across years, (b) depressive symptoms, other substance use, rural, and American
Indian/Alaska Native status will be associated with ONP use and ONP+other product poly use. Aim 2 is to
determine the role of flavors and nicotine concentration in ONP and e-cigarette use in US youth. We hypothesize
that use of ONPs or e-cigarettes with: (a) concept flavors or explicitly-marketed flavors (menthol, mint, fruit,
dessert, ice+fruit hybrid, non-menthol cooling) flavors vs. unflavored/tobacco flavors will be associated with
higher past-30-day use frequency (1-30 days) and intensity (vaping episodes or pieces/pouches per use day);
(b) nicotine concentration will have a dose-response association with use frequency and intensity. Aim 3 is to
determine associations between perceived reasons for using ONPs related to product design/ characteristics
and ONP use and poly-use in US youth. We hypothesize that in past-30-day ONP users: (a) citing concealability,
discreetness, convenience, flavor, nicotine buzz, and use where other tobacco products are not allowed as
reasons for ONP use will be associated with ONP higher use frequency and intensity; (b) citing use where
tobacco products are not permitted will be associated with more frequent use of other products. Implications
for Regulation: If U.S. youth use of ONPs and e-cigarettes with certain flavors, nicotine concentrations, or
design features (e.g., easy to conceal edible ONPs) are common and associated with frequent use and poly-
use, FDA targeting of such products in marketing denials or enforcement priorities might reduce youth uptake.
Evidence that priority populations are disproportionately vulnerable would indicate that such regulations could
reduce inequalities in non-combustible tobacco product use.

Project 2 (P2): Longitudinal Patterns of Non-Combustible Tobacco Product Use in AYAs (Co-Leaders,
Barrington-Trimis/Hughes-Halbert).
P2 examines the role of oral nicotine products (ONPs) and e-cigarettes in adverse longitudinal AYA tobacco
product use outcomes, and the product characteristics and populations driving these outcomes. To accomplish
this, P2 will: a) extend semi-annual surveys in an ongoing prospective cohort of adolescents (n=2,619) into young
adulthood; b) establish a new adolescent cohort (n=2,500) who will be surveyed semiannually from age 14-18.
In both cohorts, surveys will measure patterns and product characteristics of ONPs, e-cigarettes, and other
tobacco products used at each wave, supplemented with a novel discrete choice task that will assess implicit
preferences for ONPs and e-cigarettes in various flavors and nicotine concentrations. Aim 1 is to determine
whether ONP use is associated with subsequent risk of e-cigarette and combustible tobacco use initiation and
escalation among AYAs. We hypothesize that ONP use frequency will predict subsequent e-cigarette and
combustible tobacco use: (a) initiation, (b) frequency, and (c) intensity. Aim 2 is to identify the product
characteristics of novel ONPs and e-cigarettes that increase risk for AYA use escalation and dependence
symptoms. We hypothesize that risk of progression in AYA ONP and e-cigarette use frequency and intensity,
and dependence symptom levels will be higher in AYAs who use and have implicit preferences for ONPs and e-
cigarettes with the following characteristics: (a) very high vs. high or low nicotine concentrations; (b)
ambiguously-named concept flavors, explicitly-named fruit, menthol, mint, or ice+fruit hybrid flavors vs.
unflavored products or tobacco flavors; and (c) designs that promote more discrete use. Aim 3 is to evaluate
differential patterns of ONP initiation, use escalation, and poly-product use across diverse populations. We
hypothesize that AYAs with low socioeconomic or sexual/gender minority statuses will be at higher risk of: (a)
ONP use initiation, (b) escalation in ONP use frequency and intensity across time, and (c) poly-product use (past
30 day use of ONP+other products) across time. Implications for regulation: If we find that certain product
classes (e.g., ONPs), product characteristics (e.g., flavors, nicotine, discreet designs), or populations (e.g.,
sexual minority status) are associated with adverse longitudinal nicotine use outcomes in AYAs, targeting these
products in regulatory restrictions (e.g., marketing denials, enforcement) may yield benefits. Namely, such
regulations could deter AYAs who start using non-combustible products from progressing toward more adverse
patterns of use, including marginalized AYA groups historically subject to health disparities.

10923822,"PROJECT SUMMARY: PROJECT 3 (P3)
P3 examines which features of ONPs increase abuse liability and product appeal in young adult vapers. To
accomplish this, P3 will use virtual (Zoom) visits to recruit a nationwide sample of 320 current e-cigarette users
aged 21-25 years who are not planning to quit vaping and open to trying ONPs. We will conduct product appeal
and abuse liability tests in a mixed factorial design varying ONPs by product type (nicotine pouch v. nonmedicinal
gum) × Flavor (mint v. fruit) × Nicotine Concentration (4mg v. 2mg). Aim 1 is to assess the sensory appeal
Hypotheses: 1a) Based on preliminary data, we predict greater appeal (e.g., willingness to use again) and
desirable sensory attributes for gum vs. pouches and low vs. high nicotine. Given that mint masks nicotine’s
bitterness and irritating effects, we hypothesize:1b) Mint will suppress the sensory appeal-reducing (and
irritation-enhancing) effects of high vs. low nicotine (nicotine × flavor interaction). Aim 2 is to characterize ONP
abuse liability. Using the highest rated mint and fruit ONPs from the previous appeal session, abuse liability for
both flavors will be measured after 30-min standardized ONP self-administration via: i) positive subjective drug
effects, withdrawal/urge relief, behavioral economic indices of ONP reward value, and novel dual use liability
measures (i.e., motivation to use the ONP when e-cigarette use is constrained), and ii) naturalistic use after
provision of study ONP in 1-week follow-up. Hypotheses: 2a) subjective drug effects, withdrawal/urge relief, ONP
reward value, indices of demand, and naturalistic self-administration will be greater for high vs. low nicotine; 2b)
ONP reward value, indices of demand, and naturalistic self-administration will be higher for gum (vs. pouch) 2c)
ONP reward value, indices of demand, and naturalistic self-administration will be higher for mint than fruit,
especially in the high nicotine condition (nicotine × flavor interaction). Aim 3 is to examine ONP appeal and
abuse liability among sexual/gender minority (relative to majority) participants. We will include 20% (n = 64) self-
identified SGM participants. Hypotheses: 3a) Given prior work, we predict that subjective and behavioral indices
of appeal and abuse liability will be higher in SGM vs. heterosexual/cisgendered participants. Although we have
no hypothesis that SGM will moderate the influence of flavor, nicotine concentration or ONP type, this possibility
will be explored in regression models. Implications for regulation: If certain combinations of ONP types, flavors,
and nicotine concentrations improve the user experience and enhance abuse liability, these products could
encourage new e-cigarette+ONP dual use patterns (e.g., use ONPs at times when vaping is not possible). This
could provide the FDA with evidence that denying marketing applications or prioritizing enforcement of illegal
marketing for these specific ONPs could prevent AYAs who try ONPs from becoming persistent users with
detrimental use patterns.

P4: Social Media Influences on Engagement and Susceptibility to Non-Combustible Product Use (Co-
leaders, Unger/Allem)
P4 determines how social media depictions of ONPs and e-cigarettes with varying features are engaged with by
the public and influence youth use susceptibility on modern platforms frequented by AYAs (e.g., Tiktok) . To
accomplish this, P4 will: a) collect publicly-available social media posts depicting ONPs and e-cigarettes and
conduct deep content analysis to examine if posts with certain features (e.g., flavors, post from social media
‘influencer’) receive more likes and shares; b) to test effects of exposure to social media posts depicting e-
cigarette and ONPs in varying flavors and designs on youth susceptibility. Aim 1 is to analyze video posts from
TikTok, Instagram, Twitter, and emerging social media platforms to examine how ONPs and e-cigarettes are
portrayed on modern social media and engaged with by the public. Using a multi-method strategy, we will code
social media postings according to the types of products mentioned, flavors, stealth use, and other potentially
youth-appealing characteristics. Hypothesis (H)1: Posts that reference concept flavors with ambiguous names
(e.g., sunset, lava); concealability and stealth use; health benefits; lack of warning labels; convenience;
combustible cigarette cessation; use social media influencers; and/or use young-looking models will receive
greater degrees of engagement (e.g., likes, shares, retweets) compared to posts without these characteristics.
Aim 2 is to determine whether exposure to social media content from Aim 1 depicting concept-flavored e-
cigarettes and ONPs affect youth use susceptibility. We will recruit high school students (n=1,500 per year) into
experiments. Using digital tablets, youth view social media posts mentioning e-cigarettes and ONPs that vary on
the following characteristics: 1) flavor (ambiguous concept flavor [e.g., sunset] vs. explicit characterizing flavor
[e.g., strawberry] vs. posts without flavor mentions); 2) mentions of concealability and stealth use (yes/no). Post-
exposure self-reported perceptions and susceptibility to using the product depicted in the posting will be
measured. H2a: Susceptibility to using the ONP or e-cigarettes will be higher among youth assigned to view
social media posts with concept or characterizing flavors and/or references to stealth use. H2b: The relation of
social media post characteristics with susceptibility to use will be mediated by product perceptions. Implications
for regulation: If posts with concept flavor descriptors, references to stealth use, or other features increase
engagement and susceptibility to using ONPs or e-cigarettes, exposure to newly-marketed products on modern
social media platforms could promote AYA use. We will provide the FDA with evidence to inform marketing
restrictions on the terminology, models, and overall content that companies can use in promotional social media.

10923847,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Administrative Core (AC)
The mission of the USC TCORS in the upcoming funding period is to provide the FDA with evidence to inform
regulation across the spectrum of non-combustible tobacco products to protect young people. The Administrative
Core (AC) will catalyze, coordinate, monitor, and evaluate research within the USC TCORS 3.0 Center. It will
serve as a hub for the coordination of the scientific interactions among the integrated projects and cores that
comprise this U54 Center. The AC will utilize strategic planning and evaluation processes with tangible
deliverables and milestones to ensure quality and productivity of the science generated. The Specific Aims are:
1) To ensure the scientific and regulatory impact of the USC TCORS through effective oversight, management,
planning, and evaluation; 2) To enhance communication and interdisciplinary team science; 3) To implement a
rapid response project program that addresses emerging scientific and regulatory developments; and 4) To
facilitate interactions with other TCORS, CASEL, CRST, and federal agencies and disseminate the results of
TCORS research. The experts comprising the External Advisory Committee will convene annually to review the
progress of all TCORS components and to identify new scientific opportunities. To evaluate our progress, the
AC will apply several metrics including : (1) number of publications, impact factors, and new translational and
interdisciplinary grant applications; (2) number of publications cited in FDA policy documents including PMTA
rulings, enforcement priorities, advanced notice of proposed rule-making, proposed rule, and final rule, and
guidances; (3) evidence of new synergistic collaborations among TCORS investigators and trainees and,
importantly, with other TCORSs and federal partners; (4) ability to attract new investigators to TCORS and
regulatory science and develop their careers, emphasizing capacity to increase the diversity of the TRS
workforce; (5) development of novel materials and methods for dissemination; and (6) application of new theories
and models for tobacco regulatory science. Leveraging a strong base of existing resources and programs
developed within the USC TCORS and supplementing this with new activities, the AC will provide and connect
Center investigators and trainees with the essential resources they need to optimize their success and the impact
of the overall center. The AC will be co-led by MPIs Adam Leventhal, PhD (MPI of the USC TCORS 2.0) and
Caryn Lerman, PhD (MPI of the UPENN TCORS 1.0)."
10923852,"ABSTRACT: CAREER ENHANCEMENT CORE
The USC TCORS Career Enhancement Core (CEC) plans a multi-pronged interdisciplinary approach to enhance
the career trajectories of trainees and early-stage investigators with tobacco regulatory science (TRS) expertise
consistent with the broad theme of our center: Informing regulation of an evolving non-combustible product
market to protect young people. Given its applied nature, TRS not only requires understanding of the scientific
questions and methodology related to TRS, but also insight into FDA’s regulatory authority and how to use TRS
evidence to inform FDA in a manner that can withstand judicial challenges. To achieve this goal, we have built
upon the successful career enhancement core in USC TCORS during the current project period, with the added
value of a new co-director with decades of experience in the career development of tobacco control trainees and
scientists. For the 2023-2028 funding period, we propose a combination of didactive training, experiential
learning via participation research teams, individualized learning through the conduct of a mentored research
project, and personalized and interdisciplinary co-mentorship and career coaching. Specific content areas will
include but are not limited to: research on tobacco product appeal, susceptibility, and usage; tobacco product
manufacturing, marketing, and distribution; regulatory science; health equity and diversity, equity and inclusion;
research ethics; and community outreach and engagement. As such, the TCORS CEC will ensure that the next
generation of tobacco regulatory scientists at USC reflects the racial, ethnic, gender, and social diversity of the
populations that we serve. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Recruit and train exceptional pre-doctoral and post-
doctoral trainees in the performance of rigorous TRS research and prepare them for successful careers as
independent TRS investigators; 2) Provide personalized interdisciplinary mentorship and training for early-stage
investigators or established investigators interested in shifting their research focus to TRS; 3) Implement USC’s
new, innovative certificate program (short course) in Tobacco Regulatory Science for CEC trainees and other
students and professionals engaged in tobacco regulatory activities at the local, state, and federal levels; 4)
Assist the national TCORS Career Enhancement Working Group’s efforts to catalogue and disseminate best
practices in TRS training and career enhancement; and 5) Monitor and evaluate the progress and impact of the
CEC using established metrics. These activities will produce a diverse cohort of well-trained TRS scholars at
USC and nationwide who are poised to become scientific leaders capable of generating the evidence base
required to protect the U.S. public’s health from unnecessary morbidity and mortality resulting from the marketing
and consumption of tobacco products."

 Functional seizures (FS) are a type of functional neurological disorder (FND) characterized by seizure-like
symptoms without EEG correlates. FS are severely debilitating to children and families, making this a
significant clinical and societal burden. Recent research has revealed sense of control as a potential target for
pediatric FS treatment. Our previously published study demonstrated children with FS have decreased sense
of control over their actions compared to matched controls. Only one randomized controlled trial (RCT) for
treatment of pediatric FS has been conducted to date, which evaluated Retraining and Control Therapy
(ReACT). ReACT, developed by the PI, is a novel, adaptive intervention that aims to increase sense of control
via mindfulness and principles of habit reversal, a well-established treatment for involuntary tics. Our recently
published pilot RCT demonstrated that ReACT resulted in significantly reduced FS frequency compared to
supportive therapy, with 82% of children remaining FS-free for ≥2 months after ReACT. Further, our
preliminary data suggest sense of control significantly improves after ReACT, and increased sense of control
after ReACT is significantly related to reduced FS frequency, indicating sense of control is an effective target
for improving FS. The purpose of this study is to conduct a multi-site pilot feasibility clinical trial of ReACT, a
mind and body treatment for pediatric FS. In the study, 54 11-18-year-olds diagnosed with FS will be
randomized to engage in ReACT or the CATCH-IT web-based intervention (validated for treating mood in
children) at three sites: the University of Alabama at Birmingham, the Yale School of Medicine/Yale New
Haven Children’s Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine/Texas Children’s Hospital. FS frequency will be
measured from 30 days before treatment to 2 months after treatment. Participants and a family member will
complete baseline and follow-up assessments 7 days before treatment and 7 days and 2 months after
treatment. Feasibility of recruitment and retention will be measured by meeting annual recruitment goals and
the percent of participants who complete the 2-month follow-up. Sessions will be videotaped, and 20% of
therapy sessions will be coded for treatment fidelity using published guides to assess intervention fidelity in
behavioral clinical trials. Participant adherence to ReACT will be assessed by the percent of recommended
treatment sessions completed, and participants and parents will report if the patient used the treatment plan for
each FS episode using a FS diary."

While impressive progress has been made in tumor immunology and clinical application of immunomodulatory
agents in solid tumors, we don’t fully understand how to effectively incorporate immunotherapeutic strategies in
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) (Perna F et al., Cancer Treat Res 2022). Advances in genomic and epigenomic
characterization of AML have fostered better understanding of leukemogenesis. The average AML genome may
have only 13-16 coding mutations, of which around five are recurrent mutations in suspected driver genes.
Despite approval of novel targeted therapies, the clinical outcome of AML patients remains dismal, with a 5-year
overall survival of approximately 27%, prompting the search for additional and synergistic therapeutic rationales.
Developing immune-based therapies for AML has been challenged by the lack of surface targets. I previously
developed a target discovery strategy to identify Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) targets in AML (Perna F. et
al., Cancer Cell 2017). As we could not identify single targets with favorable expression profiles, we showed that
combinatorial pairings hold promise for CAR T-cell therapy of AML.
 Over the past two years, my lab investigated whether cancer-specific mechanisms such as alternative
mRNA splicing driven by founder mutations (i.e. genetic mutations affecting splicing factors) may shape the
cancer surface proteome, providing targets for promoting disease initiation and progression and use of
immunotherapy (Perna F. Molecular Therapy 2021 and Dong et al., Oncogene 2021). We have now developed
a novel pipeline that we called Spliced-ImmuneTargetFinder based on 5 steps to identify splice variants of cell
surface molecules: 1) RNA-seq analysis of normal cord blood CD34+ HSPCs virally expressing splicing factor
mutations such as SRSF2P95H mutation 2) custom transcriptome analysis for isoform quantification 3) isoform
switch analysis and prediction of functional consequences based on isoform sequences such as coding potential
and domain gain 4) cell surface molecule annotation based on an integrated dataset developed in our laboratory,
and 5) protein candidates validation in primary AML patient samples beyond SRSF2 mutant patients. Given that,
we identified six top candidate targets that are a) involved in at least one switch isoform b) upregulated in SRSF2
mutant cells compared to controls and c) derive from genes coding for cell surface proteins. We validated their
aberrant protein expression in several AML cell lines and primary AML patient samples by developing custom
antibodies specifically recognizing isoform unique domains derived from splicing events.
 Thus, we propose to investigate the functional roles of these promising variants and the path for targeting
the extracellular isoform-specific domains with immune-therapeutic interventions. This method for
unconventional target antigens discovery is generalizable to other cancers as well and will provide useful
information to prepare for a phase-I clinical trial in AML patients. Identification of these attractive antigens may
also open new avenues for understanding the role of splice isoforms in leukemogenesis."
10839370,"There is a fundamental gap in understanding how the diversity of cortical cell types and connectivity patterns
translates into functional dynamics of the circuits to support cognitive behaviors. This knowledge gap hampers
our understanding of the dysfunctions of decision making and other debilitating cognitive abnormalities
associated with most psychiatric illnesses, including addiction, major depression, and eating disorders. My long-
term goal is to unravel the intricate link from genes to circuits and to systems and reveal the pathology,
pathophysiology, and behavioral deficits involved in mental disorders at the level of specific circuits and their
cellular constituents. This proposal aims to determine how the genome instructs the organization and function of
the premotor cortex to support decision making. The premotor cortex in mice resembles those of the non-human
primates and humans, illustrating their evolutionarily conserved role in higher-level cognitive functions. In
addition, we have developed behavior paradigms in mice to permit the dissection of neural circuits underlying
complex behaviors using the powerful molecular tools unavailable in many other species. The central hypothesis
is that molecular signatures and connectivity patterns collectively drive premotor cortex neurons to acquire
distinct functions to support decision making. This hypothesis has been formulated based on previous work and
the preliminary data produced by the applicants. The rationale for the proposed research is that this study will
provide a new target brain area together with specific cell types and pathways for understanding and treating the
cognitive deficits implicated in psychiatric illnesses. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims:
1) Determine the function of the molecular cell types of the premotor cortex in decision making; and 2) Establish
the functional role of the afferent inputs of the premotor cortex. Under the first aim, the neural responses of
individual neurons will be mapped to their molecular identity by coupling in vivo imaging and spatial
transcriptomics. Further, the molecular identity will be manipulated to determine their causal contribution to
function. Next, the molecular identity and function of premotor cortex neurons defined by specific afferent inputs
will be established by single-cell RNA sequencing and imaging during decision making. The functional role of
these afferent inputs will be further characterized by pathway-specific optogenetic manipulations. This approach
is innovative because it combines in vivo imaging with spatial transcriptomics and utilizes transplantation
methods and the latest circuit mapping tools to reveal the novel, cognitive role of the premotor circuit in decision
making. This proposed research is significant because it answers the long-standing question about the structure
and function of cortical circuits: How do neurons of distinct identities connect and interact to produce network
dynamics underlying higher-level cognition. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to reveal the specific
cell types and brain pathways underlying decision making and to better understand, intervene, and treat
dysfunctions of decision making that are prevalent in psychiatric illnesses."

The proposed Baylor College of Medicine Mendelian Genomics Research Center (BCM-MGRC) builds on the
extensive discoveries and infrastructure established in the Baylor Hopkins Center for Mendelian Genomics.
This research program is nested within the Department of Molecular and Human Genetics at BCM and will
benefit from an extensive collaborative research infrastructure which includes, the Human Genome
Sequencing Center, the Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site, the Undiagnosed Diseases Network
Model Organism Screening Center, Baylor Genetics diagnostic laboratory, and the Baylor Knockout Mouse
Program. Notably, each of these programs has established their own national and international collaborations.
A phenotypically and ethnically diverse, international cohort of ~15,000 individuals and families with
challenging-to-diagnose rare disease conditions (those unsolved by routine clinical studies such as exome
sequencing) and who are re-contactable and consented for broad data-sharing will form the basis of the BCM-
MGRC research program. The Center will integrate novel methods of genomic data analysis, data sharing
across networks, implementation of newer genomic sequencing technologies, and methods for molecular and
organismal phenotypic interrogation of prioritized candidate disease genes and variants. The existing Data
Lake infrastructure will integrate with the Mendelian Genomics Data Coordinating Center (MGDCC) and AnVIL
to share key deliverables including genomic and phenotypic data, case metadata, and a BCM-MGRC-
developed Genomic Medicine Toolbox. As a fully integrated Mendelian Genomics Research Center, the BCM-
MGRC will inform development and delivery of an algorithm for solving the unsolved that will tackle complex
molecular mechanisms in the rare and common disease research space, with seamless integration of
anticipated discoveries to support clinical diagnostics and the generation of molecular floorplans from which to
develop precision therapeutics."

Phenotypic variability across demographically diverse populations are driven by environmental factors. The
overall goal of this proposal is to deploy data science approaches to drive discovery of associations between
exposures (E) and phenotypes (P) in demographically diverse populations. We lack data science methods to
associate, replicate, and prioritize exposure variables of the exposome (E) in phenotypes (P) and disease
incidence (D), required for the delivery of precision medicine. Observational studies are fraught with 4 unsolved
data science challenges. First, E-based studies are: (1) limited to associating a few hypothesized exposure-
phenotype pairs (E-P) at a time, leading to a fragmented literature of environmental associations. Machine
learning (ML) approaches for feature selection and prediction hold promise, however, (2) most extant E-based
cohorts contain missing data, challenging the use of ML to detect complex E-P associations, Third, (3) biases,
such as confounding and study design influence associations and hinder translation. Fourth, (4) there are few
well-powered data resources that systematically document longitudinal E-P and E-D associations across
massive precision medicine. It is a challenge to systematically associate a number of exposures in multiple
phenotypes and replicate these associations across cohorts. (Aim 1). The “vibration of effects”, or the degree
to which associations change as a function of study design (e.g., analytic method, sample size) and model
choice is a hidden bias in observational studies (Aim 2). Third, an outstanding question is the degree to which
environmental differences lead to health disparities. To address these challenges and gaps, we propose to Aim
1: develop and test machine learning methods to associate multiple environmental exposure indicators with
multiple phenotypes: EP-WAS. We hypothesize that exposures will explain a significant amount of variation in
phenotype in populations and will deposit all data and models in a novel EP-WAS Catalog. Aim 2: Quantitate
how study design influences associations between exposure biomarkers and phenotype. We will scale up,
extend, and test a method called “vibration of effects” (VoE) to measure how study criteria influences the
stability of associations (how reproducible associations are as a function of analytic choice). Aim 3. Leverage
EP-WAS and VoE to disentangle biological, demographic, and environmental influences of phenotypic
disparities in hypercholesterolemia. We will deploy EP-WAS and VoE packaged libraries in the largest cohort
study to partition phenotypic variation across demographic groups in factors for hypercholesterolemia. We will
equip the biomedical community with data science approaches for robust data-driven discovery and
interpretation of exposure-phenotype factors in observational datasets, required for the identification of
environmental health disparities. For the first time, investigators will ascertain the collective role of the
environment in heart disease at scale just in time for the All of Us program."
10868455,"ABSTRACT
A major concern of the intestinal mucosa is to execute its role in absorption of nutrients while minimizing
inflammatory or adverse immune interactions with the microbiome. Managing absorption entails not only
sorting of nutrients by intestinal epithelial cells but also delivery of those nutrients to specialized blood and
lymphatic vessels present in each villus of the small intestine. In turn, the blood and lymphatic vessels that
collectively manage outflow from the gut may need to rely on specialized mechanisms that operate to limit
dissemination of microbial signals to distal sites like the lung or the liver to avoid downstream organ injury. It is
now appreciated, for instance, that alcoholic and nonalcoholic liver damage is driven substantially by microbial
transit from the gut to the liver via the portal vein. Likewise, pulmonary damage can ensue in response to
injurious cargo in lymph that gains access to blood via the thoracic duct and quickly next flows to the lungs. Yet
mechanisms protecting against dissemination of microbial signals from the intestinal mucosa remain
incompletely understood, possibly making planned manipulations of the mucosal barrier, as in vaccination or
disease therapy, riskier than needed or resulting in surprises. For instance, our preliminary data suggest that
the documented and seemingly counterintuitive liver damage that can result from anti-TNF neutralizing
antibody therapy to treat inflammatory disease of the bowel may be due, at least in part, to disruption of
leukocyte-mediated surveillance of the draining venous vasculature that removes microbes that escape the
intestinal mucosal before they arrive to the liver. To fill in these basic knowledge gaps, we propose herein to
delineate how different regions of the intestine program leukocyte-dependent and leukocyte-independent
strategies to protect downstream cells and tissues against dissemination of microbial signals. In aim 1, we
focus on mechanisms operative in phagocytic removal from gut-draining venous blood of whole microbes that
escape the intestinal mucosal barrier and otherwise deliver the microbes to deeper tissues or distal locations.
In aim 2, we will compare how the small bowel and colon may differentially transport and neutralize soluble
microbial signals, like LPS, that can inadvertently escape the epithelial barrier to promote inflammation. This
effort will include comprehensive proteomic and lipidomic evaluation of lymph and blood draining different
regions of the gut mucosa, working with expert collaborators and taking advantage of our laboratory’s expertise
in lymphatic biology and recent studies in the transport of intestinal cargo into gut-draining venous blood."
10816544,"Our decade of experience in developing experimental and computational tools to study somatic mutations
has revealed temporal, cell-type specific, and mechanistic patterns of somatic mutations across multiple tissues
and across the human lifespan. Yet our view of somatic mutations has been limited due to cost. The field of
somatic mutations requires a technique with the flexibility of bulk tissue with the allele- and molecule-specific
power of single-cell techniques.
 To build the unified somatic variants catalog of human genome the proposed research aims to develop
a Tn5 based duplex sequencing (Tn5-duplex-seq) method, a scalable single-well workflow to capture the
landscape of somatic mutations at the single-molecule level from a range of cell or DNA input using Tn5
transposase, which resolves complementary strands by strand orientation from simple PCR-based capture.
Duplex sequencing, the capture of complementary strand information in single molecules, offers unprecedented
accuracy for detection of somatic mutations, but can be error-prone or laborious depending on the method of
capturing complementary strands. The core concept of Tn5-duplex-seq has been successfully applied to single-
cells with high accuracy (META-CS) but requires optimization. In the proposed study we aim to 1) determine
parameters for pooled cell and bulk DNA sequencing to retain single-molecule information and cost-
effectiveness, and 2) harness the power of single-molecule duplex detection which provides the basis for a suite
of analytical tools to evaluate different types of somatic mutation including single nucleotide variants, indels,
microsatellites and copy number variants with high accuracy.
 Tn5-duplex-seq can transform our understanding of somatic mutations through the innate
comprehensiveness of this technique: capturing both clonal as well as the rarest somatic mutations and providing
the basis of accuracy for analytical approaches to determine both somatic single base and structural variation.
Ultimately, our tool will be accessible, cost-effective, and scalable to be used by the larger scientific community
and easily integrated with pipelines of the Somatic Mosaicism across Human Tissues (SMaHT) Network. Tn5-
duplex-seq with comprehensive profiling of genetic mutations has the potential to answer fundamental questions
about our genomes in human biology and medicine.
 This study will reveal the landscape of somatic mutations and their accumulation in human tissue at
single-molecule resolution, enabling detection of both clonal and cell-specific somatic mutations using
a flexible-input workflow. The proposed research is significant for the comprehensive, results-based
development of strategies for discovering the mutational burden and landscape in human development and
aging. Together with the planned characterization of mutational signatures, the anticipated results should
provide knowledge that may help to develop new strategies for preventing aging and disease progression."

on the toxicity and addiction of diverse tobacco products. This includes developing new research methods that
have the potential to be used in the tobacco regulatory field beyond the scope of the Penn State TCORS

oxidants in tobacco smoke and in aerosols, and their biological effects in persons who use tobacco products.
We will examine several tobacco products including e-cigarettes (EC), little cigars and nicotine pouches.
Overall, these studies are a logical extension of our previous work on oxidants produced by combustible and
non-combustible tobacco products and the impact of product design characteristics on their production. In
addition, they stem from our previous research on the feasibility of a reduced nicotine standard for cigarettes to
minimally-addicting or nonaddicting levels. These studies indicated that some smokers will continue to use
lowered nicotine products and that additional strategies are needed to reduce tobacco harm including providing
safe alternative sources of nicotine to addicted smokers and determining which tobacco product characteristics
are associated with greater harm. Thus, the overall integrative theme of our center is to better understand how
product design characteristics of diverse and alternative tobacco products affect their toxicity and

In Project 1, we will conduct translational studies in both laboratory animal models and EC users to address
the hypothesis that inhaled EC oxidants and their potential for harm are influenced by product design features
and the biological effects of these oxidants can be measured through biomarkers of both exposure and harm.
In Project 2, we will investigate the potential toxicity related to oxidant production in little cigar smokers and

In Project 3, we will focus on the nicotine pouch as an alternative tobacco product by conducting a randomized
controlled clinical trial to test that hypothesis that biomarkers of harm, including those related to oxidative
stress, are significantly reduced in smokers who are provided high nicotine pouches. The PSTCORS will also
continue its strong support of career development in tobacco regulatory science through an integrated and

Electronic cigarettes (EC) have gained increasing popularity due, in part, to the perception of them as a
less harmful nicotine delivery device as compared to cigarettes. However, EC aerosols contain a number
of harmful or potentially harmful constituents including free radicals and other oxidants that may impact
the safety of EC. The diversity of products and rapidly evolving EC market poses a challenge for
researchers seeking to understand the potential harms associated with their use, and for regulators who
are asked to make determinations regarding their safety and seek data on device characteristics that
impact EC harm. Our in vitro data show that EC temperature and e-liquid propylene glycol (PG)
concentration are the major factors regulating the production of highly reactive free radicals and other
oxidants. Further, our preliminary in vivo animal data suggest that these oxidants increase biomarkers of
oxidative stress and inflammation. These data suggest the potential for harm in EC users and a potential
link with specific EC design features. This proposed research provides valuable data for regulatory
product standard development related to current and future ECs. It addresses our overall TCORS theme
to better understand how the physical design and chemical constituents affect the toxicity and
addictiveness of tobacco products with a focus on harm generated from oxidants. In Aim 1 we will
conduct controlled animal exposure studies to determine the effects of temperature and PG
concentration on biomarkers of exposure and harm, focusing on inflammation and oxidant stress. In Aim
2 we will conduct studies of current EC users, performing controlled inhalation exposure studies as well
as naturalistic studies to determine the effects of EC temperature and e- liquid PG concentration on
biomarkers of exposure and harm. We will use a randomized 4-treatment 4-period crossover design to
compare low and high temperature and low and high PG e-liquid concentration. Acute effects including
biomarkers of exposure, inflammation, oxidant stress and cardiorespiratory function will be measured
before and immediately after rigidly controlled inhalation sessions, after a two-week period of naturalistic
use and after on-site ad libitum use. In Aim 3 we will test for associations between solvent PG content
and free radical production and biomarkers of exposure & harm in popular commercially available pod-
type EC devices. Given the popularity of these devices, it is critical that the impact of important design
features on free radical production and oxidative stress-related biomarkers in individuals using these
products be investigated. Overall, this project addresses the well-established need for research
regarding how variation in EC product design characteristics impact constituent exposure and toxicity
and development of biomarkers to assess EC-related exposure and related harm or toxicity. As such,
this research directly addresses the Toxicity domain of the TCORS 3.0 RFA."

 The overall goal of this project is to determine the toxicity and harm associated with little cigars, with an

responsive to the RFA Scientific Domains of “Toxicity” and “Addiction.” The project helps form the
integrative theme of the overall TCORS that focuses on harm generated from tobacco-related oxidants and
the development of reliable methods for product testing.
 Little cigars have become an increasingly popular tobacco product because they offer price
advantages compared to traditional cigarettes. However, emerging evidence by our group and the Tobacco
Products Laboratory of the Centers for Disease Control implicate little cigars as more toxic than even
cigarettes. However, there is still much to be determined about the relative harm from little cigars including
their effects on oxidative stress, damage and inflammation. Our specific aims are:
 Aim1. Determine the levels of gas phase and particulate phase free radicals and other Harmful and
Potentially Harmful Constituents (carbonyls, PAHs, NNK,NNN) in the smoke of the 40 most common little cigar
brands under machine-smoked protocols (FTC, CI). The effects of physical and chemical product features
such as filter ventilation level, rod length and tobacco nitrate levels, which can be regulated under FDA
authority, will be modelled against levels of these constituents.
 Aim2. Determine the effects of little cigar features on human exposure to tobacco smoke oxidants. In a
balanced randomized cross-over study design in diverse smokers, subjects will be assigned to 6 exposure
groups. These include a high oxidant unflavored little cigar exposure condition, a low oxidant unflavored little
cigar exposure condition, a high oxidant flavored exposure condition, a low oxidant flavored exposure little
cigar exposure condition, their usual cigarette, and a control condition (unlit little cigar). Following the smoking
of each product, exhaled breath condensate samples will be collected at baseline (-15), 30, 60, 90, 120 and
150 minutes. Samples will be analyzed for levels of oxidant/inflammatory markers including hydrogen peroxide,
8-isoprostanes, and C-reactive protein, as well as nicotine, NNK and NNN.
 Aim 3. Determine the levels of biomarkers of potential harm in current users of little cigars relative to
other tobacco products, including cigarettes and e-cigarettes in the Population and Tobacco Health Study
(PATH). Aim 3a. Using Wave 1 and Wave 5 data, we will analyze and compare biomarkers of potential harm
including oxidative stress (8-isoprostane) and inflammation (Soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1,
Interleukin 6). Secondary outcomes will include biomarkers of other tobacco smoke toxicants and nicotine
metabolites, and behavioral measures of tobacco addiction. Aim 3b. Determine the effect of nitrate levels and
rod length on biomarkers of potential harm."

 Nicotine Pouches represent a rapidly growing category in the U.S. tobacco market, but little is known
about their health effects (including addiction) or effects on cigarette smoking. We propose to use a
randomized controlled trial methodology to inform FDA on the effects of nicotine pouch use in smokers
interested in reducing their smoking but not quitting smoking. The specific aim of this proposal is to recruit a
cohort of 330 current daily smokers with an interest in reducing smoking, and to measure a comprehensive
battery of behavioral and health indicators at baseline, and over 16 weeks after being randomized to use
Nicotine Pouches containing either 0mg, 3mg or 6mg nicotine in “Smooth” or Wintergreen flavors in a
randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The trial will be conducted at two sites: Penn State Hershey
and M.D. Anderson in Texas in order to recruit a diverse sample of smokers. This trial therefore addresses the
scientific domain of Product Composition and Design (specifically nicotine content and flavor additives). Our
central hypothesis is that key markers of toxicity and health effects (e.g. urine NNAL, exhaled CO, measures
of cigarette addiction [e.g. FTND], oxidative stress and oral B(a)P DNA adducts) will be significantly reduced
in smokers who are provided high nicotine (6mg) Nicotine Pouches, relative to 0mg pouches. We will also
assess the effects of Nicotine Pouch content on Nicotine Pouch addiction, and the effects of pouch nicotine
dose on cigarette and other tobacco product consumption. We will also compare the effects in those
randomized to “Smooth” versus Wintergreen flavors. After the 16-week randomized phase, participants will be
encouraged to quit smoking and connected to telephone cessation services and then followed-up 4 weeks later
(week 20) in order to ascertain whether the nicotine content of the pouches influenced intention and ability to
quit smoking. At the completion of this rigorous double-blind randomized trial we will have a better
understanding of the effects of Nicotine Pouches (and their nicotine content and flavor characteristics) on
cigarette consumption and the resulting changes to markers of health risks, oral health and nicotine addiction.
We also aim to demonstrate that the clinical trial method used here may in future be used to evaluate any
novel tobacco product in a relatively standardized manner. As such, this project specifically addresses
research priorities within the scientific domains of (a) Product Composition and Design (b) Toxicity (c) Health
Effects and (d) Addiction."
10841630,"Despite significant research efforts, the progress in understanding and prevention of suicide has been slow.
This is due at least in part to the vagueness of current suicide theories that rely on verbal specifications of all
constructs and consequent predictions and thus provide correlative rather than mechanistic accounts of
suicidal behavior (SB). In contrast, formal theoretical frameworks grounded in learning theory and decision
neuroscience, such as reinforcement learning (RL), afford a productive approach for uncovering cognitive and
decision processes involved in suicide through the use of explicit mathematical ideas to define constructs,
hypotheses, predictions, and assumptions of interest. Further, when faced with a crisis, a transition from
thinking about to attempting suicide involves the need to make a decision under increased cognitive demands
imposed by high information load (multiple decision options), uncertainty, and time pressure (current crisis).
However, although real-life decision-making is dynamic and is influenced by situational demands, existing
neural models of suicidal diathesis are relatively static and not yet integrated with the advances in decision
neuroscience. In contrast, electrophysiology augmented with computational modeling can reveal the dynamic
unfolding of within-trial neural events and is well suited for answering mechanistic questions about cortical
oscillations that underlie real-time decision-making. This project will experimentally manipulate cognitive
demands on decision-making using an RL task with a validated computational model to examine decision
processes in SB (Aim 1). It will also build on the basic electrophysiology literature that implicates alpha, beta,
and theta oscillations in working memory and cognitive control by examining neural encoding of reinforcement
history in attempted suicide (Aim 2). Exploratory Aim 3 will allow for a preliminary examination of the effects of
self-reported mood, stress, and task-related neural activity on behavior. Participants will be 120 adults (40
suicide attempters, 40 suicide ideators, and 40 healthy controls) recruited from inpatient, outpatient, and
community settings. Expert mentorship team will provide training in behavioral and computational modeling,
basic neuroscience, and electrophysiology. The work will take place at the Department of Psychiatry of the
University of Pittsburgh, which has a long track record of supporting career development of its junior faculty.
This K23 will promote the Candidate’s long-term goals of contributing to suicide research and prevention by
identifying the neurocomputational mechanisms of deficient decision-making in SB. The project is consistent
with the NIMH’s goals and funding priorities and builds on the Candidate’s prior NIMH-funded RDoC-informed

Research: The morbidity and mortality burden of gout and its cardiometabolic comorbidities continues to rise.

10813220,"Project Summary:
Microtubules (MTs) and the structures they form play essential roles in eukaryotic cells. Best known as dynamic
polymers assembled from a/b-tubulin heterodimers, MTs are absolutely required in numerous cellular processes,
including mitosis. Many of these activities depend on dynamic MT behavior, but there are critical cellular functions
that require stable microtubules. Stable singlet MTs in neurons act as tracks for axonal transport, stable doublet
MTs in axonemes generate force in cilia, and stable triplet MTs are found in centrioles and basal bodies that
organize centrosomes and cilia, respectively. Despite their importance, we know little of how stable MT-based
structures are assembled, maintained, and disassembled. Because the same tubulin dimers assemble dynamic
and stable MTs in most organisms, including the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila, the different MT behaviors
are attributed to associated proteins and protein modifications. In doublet and triplet MTs, some associated
proteins are found inside the hollow MT; these microtubule inner proteins (MIPs) are the focus of our work.
Originally discovered using various forms of electron microscopy, MIPs appeared as structures of unknown
composition inside axonemal doublet microtubules. MIPs are proposed to mitigate the deformation and stress
on doublet MTs caused by ciliary beating. Ciliary beating moves extracellular fluid in a single direction, which is
necessary for many essential processes, such as clearing mucus from airways, facilitating the movement of eggs
in the fallopian tube, and generating cerebrospinal fluid flow in the brain. Structurally analogous to the motile
cilium, the flagellum is required for sperm motility. Defects disrupting motile cilia cause a wide range of human
pathologies, including primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), hydrocephalus, and infertility in both sexes.
Understanding of how ciliary defects lead to motility problems and disease is limited. Previously, we identified
Rib72A and Rib72B in Tetrahymena cilia as MIPs required for normal cilia beating. Comparative proteomic
analyses of axonemes isolated from wild type and rib72A-, rib72B- null cells identified additional MIPs, such as
Fap115 and Calciphosin-like protein, whose assembly is defective in the mutants. We further characterized
Fap115 and showed it to be essential for normal cell motility and axoneme stability. Meanwhile, by comparing
the doublet MT structures of Tetrahymena, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and Bos taurus, we find both
conservation and diversity of MIPs in these evolutionarily distant organisms, revealing essential and divergent
functions. The long-term goal of this project is to use biophysical, genetic, and advanced microscopy tools to
better understand the function and assembly mechanisms of motile cilia. To do this, we plan to identify
Tetrahymena MIPs in both axonemal doublet and basal body triplet MTs, to map protein interactions that drive
MIP localization and assembly, and to illuminate how MIPs contribute to basal body and cilia function. Our
proposed work will significantly advance our understanding of the mechanisms of cilia assembly and function
and will help reveal how dysfunction in these processes contributes to human ciliopathies."

probe structure and function with single-cell resolution. These tools are central to advancing our understanding
of the limits of human vision in health and disease as well improving our ability to develop and evaluate novel
therapeutic strategies for patients with vision loss. The long-term goal of our research program remains to
develop and disseminate sensitive, noninvasive, high-resolution techniques to assess photoreceptor
structure and function. Over the past 14 years we have done this in healthy individuals as well as those with
a wide range of retinal and systemic diseases. Previously, our focus has been on retinal structure in inherited
retinal degenerations, owing to improved understanding of the genetic basis of these conditions and the
emergence of novel therapeutic approaches for these conditions. With the advent of adaptive optics (AO) based
tools for assessing retinal function we are uniquely positioned to expand our studies and probe the intersection
between photoreceptor structure and function in the human retina. As such, the two major goals for this grant
period are to evaluate retinal/photoreceptor structure as it applies to therapeutic potential in vision-limiting
pathology and quantify the relationship between disruptions in the photoreceptor mosaic and visual resolution.
We have assembled a multidisciplinary research team to achieve these goals through the following specific aims:
Aim 1) Determine the identity of the remnant cell population in the fovea of individuals with blue cone
monochromacy (BCM), Aim 2) Probe the link between cone spacing and AO-corrected acuity in contiguous and
disrupted cone mosaics, and Aim 3) Quantify foveal structure and function in individuals with a history of
premature birth. The diverse approaches being utilized will provide insight into the link between foveal anatomy,
photoreceptor topography, and visual behavior. This work is expected to have a positive clinical impact by filling
critical gaps in the literature and providing an enhanced framework for targeting clinical therapies in BCM as well
as understanding the impact of prematurity on retinal structure and function. Our proposal addresses research
needs, gaps, and opportunities outlined in the 2021-2025 NEI Strategic Plan, “Vision for the Future”:
“Explore and exploit connections between biological measurements and theoretical models of visual processes,”
“Conduct careful clinical phenotyping to identify quantifiable biomarkers of disease to allow for more accurate
diagnosis, risk prediction, and evaluation of treatment efficacy over time,” “Develop and validate imaging
methods for identifying clinical disease biomarkers; for enhancing disease diagnosis, classification, and
prediction; and for standardizing quantitative metrics among different devices,” and “Expand incentives to
validate and share code, develop tools that are readily shared and/or operated in the cloud, and develop best
practice guidelines for algorithm validation, documentation, code construction, and commenting.”"

 One long-standing puzzle in neuroscience is how scene perception and spatial memory
systems – which are topographically distinct in the brain – interface to enable memory-guided
visual behavior. In the context of scene perception, two crucial knowledge gaps remain. First, how
does visuospatial memory of the local environment facilitate ongoing scene perception? Second,
what are the neural underpinnings of memory-guided scene perception?
 The current project will tackle these questions by combining head-mounted virtual reality
(VR), eye-tracking, and fine-grained within-subject fMRI. We will teach participants immersive,
real-world environments and test how memory-guided scene processing is implemented in the
brain and behavior. In doing so, we will advance a new mechanistic hypothesis as to the neural
basis of memory-based predictive coding for scene processing.
 Together, this project will produce fundamental knowledge about how stored knowledge
about the world influences ongoing perception during naturalistic visual experience, and how the
brain accomplishes memory-guided visual behaviors like navigation. The resulting knowledge
promises impact for our numerous health conditions such as Alzheimer’s, dementia, macular
degeneration, cortical visual impairments, and healthy aging, in which both the visual behaviors
and brain regions investigated here are implicated."
10906248,"Project Summary - Despite decades of research into Alzheimer's disease (AD), disease-modifying
treatments for AD remain elusive. This is significantly due to challenges in understanding the molecular and
structural basis of AD. One of the two hallmarks of AD is the neurofibrillary tangles formed by the
intrinsically disordered microtubule (MT)-associated protein tau. Spreading of tau filaments in the brain is
the basis of neuropathological staging of AD. AD tau is hyperphosphorylated, truncated, and decorated with
other posttranslational modifications (PTMs). However, how these PTMs cause tau to dissociate from MTs
and misfold into -sheet amyloids, and how tau crosses the lipid membrane to spread its pathology, is not
known. AD paired helical filament (PHF) tau fibrils have a C-shaped -sheet core that encompasses part of
the MT-binding repeats. But the majority of the protein, which contains most of the disease-relevant PTMs,
is too disordered to be seen in cryo-electron microscopy data. Here we propose to employ solid-state NMR
(ssNMR) spectroscopy, electron microscopy, mouse neuron toxicity assays, and other biochemical
approaches to understand the molecular structures and dynamics of AD tau filaments, membrane-bound
tau, and MT-bound tau. We hypothesize that specific charge-charge interactions underlie the varying
conformations, dynamics and properties of tau when self-aggregated and when bound to its cellular
partners. In the last four years, we demonstrated the feasibility of applying ssNMR to study the structures
and dynamics of full-length tau fibrils formed in vitro and seeded by AD PHF tau. We will now apply this
expertise to answer three questions. In Aim 1, we will investigate how phosphorylation and truncation cause
AD PHF tau by determining the structures of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) fibrilized without anionic cofactors;
searching for minimum constructs that replicate the AD PHF tau structure and properties; and
characterizing the dynamic structures of the semi-mobile proline-rich region of tau. In Aim 2, we will
investigate tau interactions with lipid membranes by measuring the conformation, dynamics and membrane
insertion of monomeric tau bound to small and large unilamellar vesicles. We will determine the structures
of membrane-induced tau aggregates, and probe how phosphorylation and truncation affect the structure
and dynamics of membrane-bound tau. These experiments should shine light on how lipid membranes
nucleate tau aggregates and how aggregated tau crosses the membrane. In Aim 3, we will investigate the
structures of MT-bound tau as a function of phosphorylation, and probe how arginine-phosphate
interactions in the R' domain affect tau binding to MTs. A joint study of the fibrillar, membrane-bound and
MT-bound tau is crucial for understanding how tau converts from its intrinsically disordered structure to an
aggregated structure that propagates in a prion-like manner. This understanding should inform the future
design of drugs that interfere with this process."
10804735,"Abstract
When we learn a complex behavior the nervous system must continuously drive new actions, compare
predictions for the actions against outcomes, and strengthen or weaken the connections between neurons
(synapses) in order to improve future actions. However, within the multilayer brain networks that control behavior,
the behavioral impact of modifying a synapse depends upon many downstream connections. Thus, learning
requires the brain solve a ‘credit assignment’ problem: information about which synaptic modifications should be
made is distributed across the network, yet must somehow be leveraged by local processes to guide change at
individual synapses. A major gap in our ability to relate behavioral events to synaptic change is the current lack
of knowledge of these local processes that guide synaptic changes at individual neurons. Recent theories of
learning suggest that spikes generated in the apical dendrites of cortical neurons may play a key role in solving
this credit assignment problem. The experiments in this proposal will test the hypothesis that the apical dendrites
of neurons in the pre-motor cortex integrate multiple learning-instructive feedback sources, and – under
appropriate conditions – generate dendritic spikes that rapidly reconfigure the connectivity and function of
neurons. In these experiments we will use advanced optical techniques to monitor and manipulate activity in the
dendrites of a subset of neurons in the frontal cortex that have a well-delineated role in action planning. A key
prediction of our hypothesis is that the activity of the apical dendrites reflects local credit-related calculations and
that this activity is distinct from the activity transmitted to other neurons by action potential generation near the
cell body. We will test this using longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging of cortical neurons during learning to
determine how the behavioral selectivity of dendrites and cell bodies change with changing behavior. In order to
identify the contribution of dendritic spikes to learning, we will also use optogenetics to selectively suppress
activity in the apical dendrites during learning. Computational models also predict that dendritic spikes are
generated by a mismatch between outcome information arriving from long-range feedback projections and local
inhibition that predicts this feedback. To test this, we will combine synaptic glutamate imaging and optogenetics
to map the selectivity and anatomical identity of feedback projections to the apical dendrites, and calcium imaging
to determine the selectivity of local inhibitory neurons that target the apical dendrites. Together, these studies
will provide critical new insights into the circuit mechanisms governing cortical plasticity and credit assignment.
In doing so, they will provide a key framework for connecting complex learning with modifications at the individual
synapse level, and will build bridges between machine learning algorithms and models of biological neural
networks."

The long-term objective of this project is to determine the basic mechanisms by which oxidative
stress conditions contribute to the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA), with a focus on age-related OA.
Oxidative stress occurs when the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) overwhelms the
cellular antioxidant capacity, resulting in disturbances in the control of redox signaling. Peroxiredoxins
are a family of antioxidant proteins that control the local levels of H2O2 in the cell and serve to regulate
redox signaling events. Work in this project during the current funding period, using human cells,
innovative redox biology tools, and unique mouse models, has shown that oxidative stress disrupts
homeostatic signaling in chondrocytes by oxidative inactivation of the peroxiredoxins to favor p38
signaling and activation of NFκB over JNK and AKT signaling. It was found that, unlike physiologic
levels of H2O2 that activate JNK, pathologic levels inactivate JNK through oxidation of specific
cysteine thiols. The loss of JNK signaling alters the function of joint tissues. Deletion of JNK in mice
promoted cell senescence and increased the severity of age-related OA, while transgenic mice
engineered to overexpress peroxiredoxin-3 in chondrocytes developed less severe age-related OA. A
central mechanism by which cell senescence promotes age-related diseases is through the
production of inflammatory cytokines and matrix degrading enzymes by senescent cells, referred to
as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The overall hypothesis for this renewal
is that oxidative stress contributes to the development of OA by activating signaling events in
senescent joint tissue cells that promote and maintain the SASP. Aims are: 1) Determine the
mechanism by which redox signaling under oxidative stress conditions promotes the
development of the SASP. Hypothesis: Oxidative stress creates an imbalance in JNK and p38
activity, favoring p38, to promote the SASP. 2) Identify the role of the endogenous antioxidant
systems in regulating the development of the SASP. Hypothesis: Inactivation of one or more of
the peroxiredoxins, due to hyperoxidation or NADPH depletion, contributes to the altered redox
signaling controlling the SASP. These studies will define a novel mechanism by which disturbed
redox signaling, due to oxidative stress in joint tissues, promotes development of OA through the
SASP. The results will support the future development of novel therapeutics for OA that control the
SASP by targeting specific proteins within redox signaling pathways that promote and maintain the
SASP. This “senomorphic” approach of altering the secretory phenotype of senescent cells will
provide an important alternative to a “senolytic” strategy of targeted cell death."

Long-term heavy drinking causes multiple organ injury with the liver as the most impacted organ. Alcoholic liver
disease (ALD) covers a spectrum of liver lesions, including simple steatosis, alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis.
Unfortunately, FDA approved medication is not available for any stage of ALD. Thus, there is an urgent need to
investigate the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and explore therapeutic strategies for ALD. Increasing
evidence support that translocation of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMP) from the intestine to
the liver triggers hepatic inflammation. During the past funding period, we investigated the role of type 1
conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) in alcohol-induced defects at the gut-liver axis. We observed that Chronic
alcohol feeding reduced intestinal cDC1s and IL-12. In accordance, Th1 cells and their INF- expression were
also reduced. Batf3 knockout mice (cDC1 deficient) showed that cDC1 deficiency exaggerated alcohol-
reduced Th1/IFN- and worsened alcohol-induced dysbiosis, gut barrier dysfunction, PAMP translocation and
hepatic inflammation. Adaptive transfer of cDC1s reversed alcohol-decreased intestinal defects and
amelioration of ALD. We also found that IFN-γ administration restored intestinal STAT1 and STAT3,
upregulated AMPs, orchestrated gut microbiota, and reversed alcohol-induced endotoxemia and hepatic
inflammation. These results suggest that dysregulation of dendritic cell-T cell axis represents a novel
mechanism in alcohol-induced pathogenesis at the gut-liver axis. Our preliminary studies further demonstrated
that chronic alcohol feeding increased type 2 conventional dendritic cells (cDC2s) in the intestine, suggesting
an imbalance between cDC1 and cDC2 responses. cDC2s after antigen acquisition in the lamina propria
migrate to lymph tissues and induce Th17 cell differentiation. Indeed, we observed that CD4+IL-17+ T cells
(Th17 cells) were increased in the lymph tissues after alcohol exposure. We also found that alcohol increased
the dendritic cell surface succinate receptor, GPR91, in association with increased intestinal succinate. These
results suggest a novel host immunity-microbiota crosstalk mechanism in activation of cDC2s-Th17 cells circuit
in alcohol-induced pathogenesis at the gut-liver axis. This renewal project plans to investigate the role of DC2
activation and induction of Th17 response and the mechanism of how alcohol activate cDC2s in the
pathogenesis of ALD. The project will carry out three aims. Aim 1 is to determine the causal role of intestinal
cDC2 cell activation in alcohol-induced pathogenesis at the gut-liver axis. Aim 2 is to investigate a succinate-
activated GPR91 signaling pathway in alcohol-induced intestinal DC2 activation and migration. Aim 3 is to
determine the mechanisms by which alcohol elicits an intestinal succinate signal."

 Cancer cells require substantial antioxidant capacity to overcome toxic effects of reactive oxygen species
(ROS). Despite their exclusive cytosolic production, cellular antioxidants are also abundantly present in
organelles, particularly in mitochondria. In particular, mitochondria, as the source of reactive oxygen species
(ROS), require substantial availability of antioxidants to protect its critical redox functions. While previous work
suggests a link between mitochondrial redox metabolism and tumor growth, molecular mechanisms involved in
maintaining mitochondrial redox homeostasis and the role of mitochondrial antioxidants in tumor progression
are poorly understood. Among endogenous mitochondrial antioxidants, glutathione (GSH) is the dominant small
molecule thiol, existing in millimolar concentrations. GSH is commonly upregulated in cancer cells, enabling
metastatic colonization and resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. In our previous work, using biochemical and
proteomics methods, we identified SLC25A39, a mitochondrial membrane carrier of unknown function, to
mediate GSH import into mitochondria of cancer cells. SLC25A39 loss strongly reduces mitochondrial GSH
levels and its import, without impacting those in the cytosol. Our preliminary work suggests that SLC25A39
expression is associated with poor prognosis and decreased survival of breast cancer patients, and that
SLC25A39 is necessary for breast cancer invasion and metastasis. This finding gave us the opportunity, for the
first time, to uncouple mitochondrial redox metabolism from that of cytosol during tumor progression. Building
upon this evidence, in this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that mitochondrial GSH import by SLC25A39
enables metastatic colonization of breast cancer cells. To address this, using biochemical and genetic
experiments, we will first identify the precise mechanism by which mitochondrial GSH enables breast cancer
cells to metastasize to lung. We will then test the role of mitochondrial GSH import by SLC25A39 in tumor
formation and metastasis using mouse and human breast cancer models. Finally, SLC25A39 protein levels
substantially increase during lung colonization, indicating a strong selective pressure to induce mitochondrial
GSH uptake during metastasis. Therefore, we will determine how mitochondrial GSH availability and lung
environment regulate SLC25A39 protein levels in breast cancer cells. This proposal will reveal the role of
mitochondrial GSH homeostasis in breast cancer progression and will identify a compartmentalized sensing
pathway essential for metastatic colonization."

Complex human diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and many human cancers, exhibit
strong differences between males and females in risk, disease progression, and response to therapy. Our
previous work in normal and disease tissues from males and females has shown that while there are rarely
significant differences in genetic associations or gene expression that can explain the observed sex-based
differences, modeling gene regulatory processes can lead to key insights into the likely drivers of sex differences
in health and disease. This suggests that both sex-based factors and epigenetic variability likely work together
to help define risk and response. This observation is further supported by the fact that sex-based differences are
not static but rather evolve over the course of an individual’s lifespan, during which epigenetic state and hormonal
regulation of gene expression likely change in related to gender-associated factors. In this application, we
propose to merge the threads of DNA methylation variation, gene regulatory modeling, and sex-based regulatory
network assessments to better understand the factors that drive the observed sex and gender-related differences
in human diseases. We envision three specific aims within the context of our research plan, including:
Developing tools for the inclusion of sex chromosomes in network models and methods for comparing
male and female networks; Refinement of network tools for setting epigenetic priors and inclusion of
DNA methylation data as a primary data for studying sex differences informed by gender; and
Application to diseases with sex differences, including COPD and lung cancer as primary examples. We
expand network methods to develop tools to better incorporate the effects of the allosomes in the process of
gene regulation. This is particularly important as we have discovered current methods for normalization of sex
chromosome gene expression can influence observed gene regulatory interactions. We will refine tools to
incorporate epigenetic regulation into our sex-specific models, exploring how DNA methylation may capture
gender to influence gene regulatory network structure and disease risk. Understanding the sex- and gender-
related differences in this regulatory landscape will help us better understand human diseases and highlight
approaches to identify sex-aware therapeutic targets. This proposal is highly responsive to the goals of RFA-
OD-19-029: The Intersection of Sex and Gender Influences on Health and Disease as it will investigate a
systems/network based approach to investigating sex and gender influences in human disease, as well as
providing publicly available tools and networks to facilitate sex and gender research."
10873099,"While most people with psychosis are not dangerous and most violence is committed by non-psychotic people,
people with psychotic disorders are at increased risk for violence, and violence is associated with worse
outcomes and increased stigma. Therefore, decreasing violence risk in psychosis is clinically relevant and has
important public health implications. Several clinical studies suggest that clozapine is superior to other
antipsychotic medications in reducing violence or aggression. However, there were numerous limitations of
these studies including that most of them were observational and non-randomized, included small sample sizes,
or focused on hostility, non-physical aggression, or self-harm, rather than violent acts. Further, the majority of
these trials were not generalizable to outpatient, community settings. No large effectiveness study has
examined the effects of clozapine on violent behavior in community settings. We propose a randomized,
parallel-group, 24-week, open-label, single (rater)-blind, 7-site clinical trial to examine the effects of treatment
with clozapine vs. treatment as usual (TAU) on the risk of violent acts in 280 individuals with schizophrenia at
high risk for violence. This trial will be a collaboration of 7 sites, coordinated by the New York State Psychiatric
Institute. The 6 additional collaborating sites contribute unique expertise and will ensure an adequate sample
size for this trial. Our primary effectiveness outcome is time to violent acts as measured by the MacArthur
Community Violence Interview (MCVI). We will also explore the effects of clozapine on the Point Subtraction
Aggression Paradigm. While many factors may contribute to violent behavior in individuals with schizophrenia,
including positive symptoms, psychopathy, impulsivity, and substance use, evidence suggests that the final
common pathway for many of these disparate causal influences likely runs through behaviors captured by the
Excitement Factor of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (i.e., a composite of the scores of excitement,
uncooperativeness, poor impulse control, and hostility). Importantly, our target (the excitement factor of the
PANSS) has been validated to measure excitement-like symptoms in clinical trials in schizophrenia, is sensitive
to treatment, has been linked to the neurobiology of violence in spectroscopy and PET studies, and
differentiates clozapine from other antipsychotic drugs. We will also explore the effects of clozapine vs. TAU on
positive symptoms (e.g., persecutory delusions) and alcohol and substance use, and how these effects
influence the risk for violent acts. To enhance the safe implementation of this study in this vulnerable population
at risk of violent behaviors, we will implement clinical safety and treatment engagement protocols that rely upon
standard personnel and that will be readily generalizable. This trial will provide guidance on the use of clozapine
for violence in community settings and will definitively test hypotheses regarding mechanisms of its anti-violence
effects. The results will be immediately relevant to practice and will impact public health because there is
currently no standard approach for the treatment of violence in schizophrenia."

Clinical studies have reported a higher incidence of surgical stress-induced acute injury in the elderly. The
mortality after cardiac surgery, atherosclerosis, sepsis, or coronary angioplasty in patients older than 60 years
of age appears to be related to a decline in intrinsic resistance to surgical stress-related acute injury. The
mechanisms responsible for the atherosclerosis-related vascular intolerance in aging are incompletely
understood and the signaling pathways involved in regulating cellular responses to acute injury related
inflammation arising from surgical stress remain largely unknown. The blocked vessels by atherothrombosis
cause ATP depletion and subsequent AMP accumulation, which activates AMP-activated protein kinase
(AMPK), a central component of the cellular stress response that regulates oxidative metabolism towards ATP
restoration under stress conditions. AMPK regulates pathways that control the oxidative stress-related
vascular inflammation. We have reported that an aging-related reduction in the macrophage migration
inhibitory factor (MIF)-AMPK signaling cascade is an important contributing factor leading to increased
sensitivity to reactive oxygen species (ROS) by surgical ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery.
Accordingly, we hypothesize that aging is associated with a decline in the ability of vascular cells to render the
MIF-AMPK signaling cascade active in response to inflammation caused by atherosclerosis, thus resulting in
exacerbated vascular injury. We will test this hypothesis in the following specific aims: Aim 1, define the role of
the MIF receptor in age-related impaired AMPK signaling in response to vascular inflammation by oxidative
stress; and Aim 2, evaluate the capability of small-molecule MIF agonist to improve stress-induced MIF-AMPK
activation in the cardiovascular system. In this manner, we seek to advance our understanding of the
mechanisms behind aging-related alterations in cardiac AMPK signaling pathways in response to inflammation
by surgical ligation of the coronary artery. Furthermore, we propose both exercise and a novel pharmacological
strategy aimed at ameliorating oxidative stress-induced vascular inflammation that occurs in the older
population."

The practical goal of this project is to obtain high-resolution genetic and epigenetic maps that reveal the
evolutionary relationships and dynamics over space and time in Barrett’s esophagus (BE). Barrett’s is the
precursor to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) therefore patients undergo surveillance exams to detect early
cancers. Our study will provide an unprecedented level of molecular detail that has not been achieved in any
previous study of pre-cancer evolution in BE. Importantly, the proposed experiments and analyses will define a
BE patient’s “tissue phylogeography”, including significant features of clonal expansions that are predictive of
BE progressing to future EAC. To this end, we will leverage a rich set of serially collected tissue samples and
genomic data from patients in the Seattle BE natural history cohort that includes cancer outcome patients and
an age-matched group of patients with non-cancer outcomes, sampled at multiple time points. The unique
design of this case-control study enables us to identify (epi)genetic markers prognostic of progression using
data from advanced multi-omic platforms. Computational modeling and phylogenetics will be used to extract
the elusive but essential information on when BE arises in a patient, how fast particular clones spread in BE,
and how dispersive these clones are within the tissue. Ultimately, we will use these evolutionary quantities to
forecast outcomes of cancer versus non-cancer in a well-documented prospective patient population.
The long-term goal of the project is to assess the feasibility and performance of data-driven predictive models
that can be translated to improved clinical care. Notably, this project will quantify the utility of robust molecular
markers for EAC risk to improve the current practice of relying solely on histopathologic features that are
difficult to assess and interpret. To facilitate this goal, we will parameterize the inferred space-time dynamics in
phylogeographic reconstructions of this pre-cancer, and embed these measurements in a multiscale model
framework for progression from BE to EAC in a population. This multiscale approach explicitly models the
stochastic clonal expansions at the cellular level over a patient’s lifetime, within the spatial constraints of the
esophagus. The three specific aims for our project are: 1) Measure how new clones arise and spread within
Barrett’s glands; 2) Measure how glands move and grow through the Barrett’s lesion by quantifying epigenetic
drift to estimate Barrett’s tissue age and constructing phylogeographies to infer how Barrett’s clones spatially
evolve; and 3) Integrate spatiotemporal measurements from multi-region Barrett’s samples into a multiscale
model of EAC development. The proposed project is innovative because we will infer evolutionary parameters,
such as rates of stem cell replacement and TP53 two-hit inactivation in BE, from (epi)genomic data for the first
time. This research is significant because it is expected to provide predictive models that incorporate dynamic
biomarkers of EAC progression in BE patients to potentially offer new strategies of risk-based surveillance."

At the cornerstone of human bipedal locomotion are the pelvis and knee, two hind limb skeletal structures for
which we know little about their respective development in humans. Indeed, these structures have complex
3-D morphologies whose initial patterns arise during the chondrogenic anlagen stage, when coordinated
cellular differentiation and proliferation establish various tissue types and the spatial relationships between
different structural components (e.g., between the knee’s distal femoral condyles and proximal tibial platform,
or between the pelvis’ ilium, pubis, ischium, and acetabular subdomains). Yet, for developing human skeletal
structures, we understand little about these cellular events and their relationships to tissue morphology and
function. Moreover, while one can envision that these events are mediated by a pleiotropic or common ‘skeletal
growth’ gene set and accompanied regulatory apparatus, how this tool kit is used in developing humans to
build each structure, remains a mystery. As biomedicine move towards regenerative therapies for joint tissues
and mechanistic investigations into developmental disorders of the skeleton, it is crucially important to gain a
better understanding of how cells of the skeleton and joints acquire their functional roles, and it is both timely
and critical to establish this at single cell and spatial resolutions. To date, large functional genomics-based
consortia, such as an ENCODE or the ROADMAP EPIGENOMICS PROJECT, have not focused on the
skeleton due to logistical issues in extracting cartilage cells from developing skeletal elements composed of
hard extracellular matrix. However, recent advances on this front by the grant investigators have allowed them
to isolate and study individual cartilage cells from developing human skeletons. The focus of this proposal,
therefore, is to more deeply investigate how the human knee, pelvis, and hind limb in general form in utero, at
the level of individual cells and in understanding how changes in their biology and behavior drive the respective
development of each hind limb structure. This will be accomplished via two main aims, one focused on the use
of spatial transcriptomics to examine expression dynamics histologically (Aim 1), and another on the use of a
single cell (sc) multiomics approach (Aim 2), consisting of scRNA-sequencing (to detect genes) and
scATAC-sequencing (to detect regulatory regions) on the same cell. By simultaneously profiling gene
expression and regulatory element availability at the individual cell level from many cells of these developing
human structures, and spatially, the necessary resolution will be achieved to define small but important
nuances in the genetic programs that govern anatomical-site-specific cartilage cell biology and how it links to
hind limb morphology. Use of these protocols developed by the grant’s Team will help ensure that an
extraordinary resource is provided to the musculoskeletal biology community, and that crucial information
needed to develop novel pharmaceutical and regenerative medicine-based therapeutics is made public."

Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is one of the most effective tools to reduce cancer morbidity and mortality.
Yet, CRC screening rates at federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) in rural areas lag behind more well-
resourced healthcare systems and national goals. Improving CRC screening in rural FQHCs requires attention
to the needs of their patient populations as well as their limited resources for implementation; yet, little
research has tested CRC screening programs with FQHCs that are culturally responsive, contextually relevant
and alleviate implementation burden. Our long-term goal is to scale implementation of CRC screening
solutions that will reduce inequities that burden FQHCs. Our team has developed a novel digital health
platform, mPATH-Cloud, that has the potential to help alleviate implementation burden on clinical teams by
automating many key processes, all the while delivering CRC screening communication, education, and
services in ways that have proven to be culturally responsive, patient-centered, and effective. Thus, our study
seeks to evaluate mPATH-Cloud with rural FQHCs to demonstrate effectiveness at improving guideline
concordant screening and identify critical implementation processes and outcomes that will impact future
dissemination and scalability. We will use an embedded experimental mixed methods model, which includes
an individual randomized trial of the multi-component intervention, quantitative and qualitative measures to
identify ways to improve tailored messaging and adapt strategies to improve effectiveness across diverse
patient profiles, and quantitative and qualitative measures of processes and outcomes to improve
implementation. Our team is well-situated to lead this research, which if successful, will lead to progress
toward reducing inequities in low-income rural communities served by FQHCs."

In the past few years, large genotyped cohorts are getting larger. We are getting closer to the era where genotype
information of a large portion of the population is available. Informatics methods are critically needed for
translating the new information into insights for human genetics. Powered by informatics innovations, the
landscape of IBD segment detection has been transformed in the past 3 years. In 2019, we published RaPID,
the first IBD segment calling method efficient enough for biobank-scale cohorts. Afterwards, a generation of
methods has been developed to offer solutions for IBD segment calling. In addition, we delivered new algorithms
and methods that enriched the PBWT data structure. Also, the impacts of calling out IBD segments in large
cohorts are demonstrated by the powering of precision characterization of diversity in general population cohorts,
the studies of population history and human behavior, IBD-based relatedness estimate, and IBD-mapping.
However, current success in identifying IBD segments from biobank-scale cohorts is only the beginning. More
informatics method developments are needed to fully unleash the power of genotype information. First, current
methods are mainly for longer IBD segments (greater than 3 or 5 centimorgans (cM)), and the detection power
for shorter segments are insufficient. Also the accuracy is not uniformly high across all genomic regions and all
populations. Second, current methods are mainly for IBD segments shared between a pair of haplotypes. With
large sample sizes, multi-way IBDs are omnipresent but under-studied. Third, methods for identifying IBD
segments between a query haplotype and reference panels (1-vs-n) are needed. For a small sample or even
individuals, 1-vs-n query against a panel will enable powerful interpretation leveraging the rich information in the
reference panel. However, current IBD segment detection methods are mainly a batch calling mode that
conducts n-vs-n comparisons and thus are not flexible enough to address such needs. In this competitive renewal
project, we propose to further develop efficient, accurate, and flexible algorithms for IBD segment detection for
large biobank-scale data. We will improve IBD segment calling across the genome, across length-spectrum, and
across ethnicities; we will develop methods for multi-way IBD cluster detection; and we will develop reference-
based IBD calling and threading methods. These new informatics methods will enable the community to better
leverage the genetic relationships in large genotyped cohorts for genetic discovery."

Background: Sex Chromosome Trisomies (SCT) including Klinefelter (XXY), XYY syndrome, and Trisomy X (XXX), occur in 1 out
of every 500 births. In childhood there are increased risks for language and learning disabilities, ADHD, autism, and emotional
disorders. Medically, SCTs are associated with testicular failure in XXY, ovarian failure in XXX, and all have increased morbidity
and mortality due to high risks for insulin resistance, seizures, and other health conditions. Prenatal SCT diagnosis has dras-
tically increased over the past decade in the US with more widespread noninvasive prenatal screening (NIPS). The eXtraordi-
narY Babies Study was launched in 2017, and has enrolled the largest and most diverse prenatally diagnosed SCT cohort to
date, including 271 infants followed prospectively from 2 months to 3-4 years of age with detailed medical, hormonal, and
developmental phenotyping coupled with a longitudinal biobank including over 1250 biospecimens. Results have identified
medical features not previously described in SCT, detailed acquisition of developmental milestones, and identified differ-
ences in early speech and behavior profiles known to be ‘red flags’ of later diagnoses such as autism, dyslexia, and ADHD.
Parents shared experiences highlighting the need for improved genetic counseling models.
 Follow-up of participants into the school-age years is critical as important comorbidities such as reading disabilities,
ADHD, autism and endocrine dysfunction being to emerge, phenotypic variability broadens, and developmental and health
outcomes become more predictive of later functioning. In this renewal project we aim to: (1) Describe and compare the
natural history of neurodevelopment, medical problems and hormonal profiles of SCT through prospective study of the eX-
traordinarY Babies cohort into early school age, (2) To identify of poor developmental and health outcomes in SCT, with
special attention to modifiable factors of development, health and environment to guide future intervention trials, and (3)
To develop an evidence-based, parent-informed best practice model for prenatal genetic counseling unique to the needs of
the SCT population.
Approach: Current study participants (n=262; XXY=174, XYY=25, XXX=54, XXYY/XXXY=9) and 60 newly recruited children will
complete annual assessments up to 7-8 years of age. New recruitment will target those from underrepresented racial and
ethnic groups, low socioeconomic status, rural locations, and XYY and XXX. Demographics, health and family history, and
education/interventions will be collected, along with assessments of: (1) cognitive, psychological and motor functioning; (2)
physical and gonadal measures and (3) quality of life. Statistical models will contrast longitudinal profiles for each SCT group
and compare to population norms. Linear models and logistic regression will be used to test the association between poten-
tial early risk factors and selected outcomes at age 7. Biological samples will be added to the biorepository. Parent experi-
ences with the prenatal SCT diagnosis will be analyzed via a mixed method approach to develop evidence-based genetic
counseling resources. Impact: Longitudinal study of the largest cohort of prenatally identified children with SCT provides a
novel resource that will inform the natural history of developmental and medical profiles in SCTs, guide genetic counseling,
identify targets for intervention trials, inform newborn screening, and provide an invaluable data and biospecimen repository
for future research."

New HIV infection rates far outpace the targets set by global health organizations, despite important progress
in curbing the progression of the epidemic. In 2017, an estimated 1.8 million people became newly HIV
infected globally. New HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) strategies are needed urgently to overcome this
alarming prevention gap. Adherence to daily dosing regimens has emerged as a critical factor driving the
clinical success of HIV-1 PrEP with antiretroviral (ARV) drugs in susceptible, uninfected individuals. This
challenge can be mitigated with sustained release or “long-acting” ARV formulations that reduce dosing
frequency, ideally to intervals of once per month or longer, and target the heterogeneous populations most at
risk from contracting HIV. Several ARV drugs are undergoing clinical evaluation as injectable sustained release
formulations, but suffer from a number of drawbacks: a high initial concentration burst; the particles cannot be
removed following injection should there be an adverse reaction; the approach requires specific ARV
physiochemical characteristics, dramatically limiting the range of candidate drugs. Multiple large-scale clinical
trials have shown that PrEP using oral preparations of the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)
tenofovir (TFV) can prevent HIV-1 infection in a significant proportion of individuals. A long-acting TFV
formulation for systemic dosing would add a much-needed NRTI to the portfolio of sustained release PrEP
options. Under previous NIH support we have developed a subdermal implant delivering the highly potent
prodrug TFV alafenamide (TAF). We have evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PKs) and safety of prototype
implants delivering TAF over a wide range of release rates in mice, beagle dogs, and sheep. The devices were
safe in the target dosing window and allowed us to simulate a human dose for HIV-1 PrEP. The proposed
efforts build on these important accomplishments and will test the central hypothesis that a one-year TAF
implant with practical physical dimensions can safely prevent sexual HIV-1 infection. In Aim 1, we will design
the next generation TAF implant to maximize drug loading and control of drug release using scalable
processes and acceptable biomedical materials. We will conduct PK studies in rats and sheep to help select
lead candidates for extensive safety assessment in sheep under Aim 2. Here, the implant materials and
excipients will be evaluated to maximize local tolerance in vivo, including using innovative targeted
proteomic/metabolomic and non-invasive imaging methods. In Aim 3, HIV-1 (SHIV) prevention efficacy studies
will be carried out in rhesus macaques using repeat low dose rectal, vaginal, and penile exposure models. The
PK-pharmacodynamic relationships will be investigated in exploratory models. The project will advance our
scientific knowledge on the pharmacologic properties of sustained release systemic TAF and its metabolites
compared with oral formulations in the context of HIV-1 prevention."
10887558,"Project Summary / Abstract
The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is the only organ system that is capable of intrinsic neural reflexes. These are
initiated by a unique neuron type called intrinsic primary afferent neurons (IPANs). IPANs are key to
orchestrating neural reflexes that allow efficient processing of meals for nutrient uptake by rapidly adapting to
changing luminal content to alter vascular, secretory and motor function. In the guinea pig, IPANs use multiple
mechanisms of neuroplasticity to adapt to inflammatory, hormonal and neural stimuli. From these studies it is
clear that IPAN neuroplasticity mediates digestive disease. Even though the mouse has become the vertebrate
animal model of choice for digestive disease, murine IPANs have lacked consensus markers making precise
studies of mouse IPANs inconceivable. These issues are now resolved by our recent transcriptome and
morphological analysis of the ENS, which challenges the dogma that IPANs are a single class of neuron, and
suggest that rather there are four classes of IPANs. In combination with recent advances in morphological (i.e.
tissue clearing) and physiological approaches (i.e. genetically-encoded markers and activity indicators) we are
now able to study mouse IPANs in a relatively high throughput manner. The objective of this proposal is to test
the overall hypothesis that different classes of IPANs possess morphologies and physiology that uniquely
contribute to intestinal function. This hypothesis will be tested in a series of experiments designed to address
three specific aims: Specific Aim 1: determine the structure of receptive fields and connectivity of murine
IPANs; Specific Aim 2: determine responses of murine IPANs to mechanical and chemical stimuli; Specific Aim
3: determine the role of IPANs in gastrointestinal physiology. Collectively, these studies address a critical gap
in our knowledge on the basic neural control of gut functions. Deciphering sensory capabilities and functional
responses of molecularly defined IPANs are likely to pave the way for future improvements in diagnostic and
therapeutic strategies of digestive disease."
10852919,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alcohol misuse is often associated with pathological aggression, a recurrent pattern of disruptive and violent
behavior. Despite the significant socioeconomic burden imposed by the repercussions of this comorbidity, avail-
able treatments are limited and inadequate. A critical problem in treating the association of alcohol misuse and
pathological aggression lies in the complex links between these two entities: on the one hand, alcohol worsens
violence propensity in predisposed individuals; on the other hand, anger and aggression increase the risk of
alcohol use. Disentangling the links between these conditions is critical to developing better therapies.
To study these neurobiological mechanisms, we focused on the best-characterized gene × environment (G×E)
interaction underlying pathological aggression and alcohol use, occurring between low-activity alleles of the
MAOA gene (encoding the enzyme monoamine oxidase A) and child maltreatment. We recently developed the
first animal model of this G×E interaction by subjecting a line of mice with an MAOA hypomorphic mutation to
early-life stress during the first week of life.
The studies proposed in this application will test the hypothesis that the interaction of low-activity MAOA variants
and child maltreatment leads to alterations of the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, which predispose
to a vicious cycle of increased alcohol use and aggression. The three Aims of this proposal will focus on 1) the
common neurodevelopmental mechanisms of these two problems; 2) the adverse effects of alcohol drinking on
aggression; and 3) the impact of anger and social reactivity on the propensity to drink alcohol. Taken together,
this research will help elucidate the mechanisms of the comorbidity of alcohol misuse and pathological aggres-
sion and identify new potential targets for the prevention and treatment of alcohol-associated violence."
10890643,"The temperament of behavioral inhibition (BI) is seen in approximately 10-15% of infants and it is among the
earliest and strongest predictors of later anxiety. Nevertheless, around 50% of toddlers with high BI do not
manifest anxiety problems in childhood or adolescence. Preliminary evidence suggests that cognitive control
moderates BI-related anxiety risk, with higher risk among youth who rely more on reactive control strategies
than on proactive control strategies. To date, work examining BI youth has largely measured cognitive control
and anxiety concurrently, limiting the ability to predict future clinical outcomes. Moreover, the neural
mechanisms underlying proactive and reactive control remain underspecified, partly because these two types
of control may involve overlapping brain regions. This K23 application presents a research and training
program that will support the applicant on a path toward becoming an NIH-funded independent investigator
focused on neurocognitive mechanisms that moderate the early-life risk for emotional difficulties such as
anxiety. The activities in this application build on the candidate’s prior training and are set in a resource-rich
environment that will foster the development of expertise in 1) advanced neuroimaging analytic methods such
as fMRI-constrained source localization of EEG, and 2) design, statistical analysis, and interpretation of
longitudinal research to study changes in functioning over time. The current research proposal uses an
accelerated longitudinal design and combines EEG and fMRI measures in a sample of 100 9- to 11-year-olds
with and without a history of high BI. Proactive control, reactive control, and anxiety will each be assessed
twice, 1 year apart. This design will allow the candidate to 1) test cross-sectional associations between neural
measures of proactive/reactive control and child anxiety at baseline, 2) identify commonalities in neural
substrates of cognitive control as measured across EEG and fMRI, and 3) test for temporal precedence of
proactive and reactive control over anxiety. The overarching hypothesis is that, specifically among children with
high BI, high reliance on reactive control and low reliance on proactive control prospectively predict worsening
anxiety difficulties. This training and research program will facilitate the candidate’s transition to an
independent research career, will inform the assessment and identification of youth at particularly high risk for
future anxiety problems, and provide viable target mechanisms for early prevention efforts.
RELEVANCE: The novel combined application of fMRI and EEG to the study of cognitive control will shed light
on the unique contributions of proactive and reactive control on anxiety risk among youth with BI. This, coupled
with a prospective longitudinal design, will help enhance prediction of anxiety outcomes among BI youth. In the
long term, results may be used to inform: 1) the identification of BI youth at particularly elevated risk for future
anxiety, and 2) the development of novel therapeutics to prevent or treat anxiety in this population."
10911006,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a diffuse, inflammatory lung disease characterized by
increased vascular permeability, decreased lung compliance, and loss of aerated tissue affecting 200,000 in the
US annually with 40% mortality. Covid-19 infections have significantly increased these numbers over the past
year. The mechanisms through which ARDS arises and how host factors confer an increased risk of developing
severe disease remain unclear. It is known that inflammation due to underlying disease is linked to ARDS
progression and severity. We hypothesize that lipase-catalyzed degradation of pathogen phospholipids to
soluble lysolipids and free fatty acids can lead to a mechanical lung instability known as the “Laplace Instability
by inactivating healthy lung surfactant. The Laplace Instability occurs because the intra-alveolar pressure is
increased by the Laplace pressure, ∆𝑃 = 2𝛾⁄𝑅 ; ∆𝑃 is higher in alveoli with smaller radii, 𝑅, than larger alveoli if
𝛾, the surface tension, is constant. This would cause smaller alveoli to deflate and fill with fluid, while the larger
alveolar become distended, both symptoms of ARDS. To prevent this, 𝛾 must decrease with decreasing alveolar
radius such that 2𝐸∗(𝜔) − 𝛾 > 0 in which 𝐸∗(𝜔) = 𝐴(𝜔)(𝜕𝛾⁄𝜕𝐴) is the dilatational modulus. For healthy lung
surfactant 2𝐸∗(𝜔) -g >> 0. However, during inflammation, lysolipid concentrations increase by orders of
magnitude in the alveolar fluids due to lipases acting on pathogen membranes. We find that
lysopalmitoylphosphatidylcholine concentrations above its critical micelle concentration (CMC) cause 𝐸∗(𝜔) of
lung surfactant monolayers to decrease dramatically leading to 2𝐸∗(𝜔) − 𝛾 ≤ 0 at breathing frequencies, which
can lead to the Laplace Instability and compromise uniform lung inflation. Theoretical models show 𝐸∗
decreases due to diffusive exchange of lysolipids between the monolayer and the micelles in the adjacent fluid.
This project will use a combined experimental and theoretical approach to understand how pathogen derived
lysolipids with widely varying CMC’s influence 𝐸∗(𝜔) so that chemical or physical interventions might be
developed to reverse the Laplace Instability. In Aim 1, we will use the unique experimental techniques developed
in our labs to establish how the dilatational properties of lung surfactant change due to contact with lysolipids
representative of various pathogens at concentrations above and below the CMC. We will determine the impact
of 𝐸∗(𝜔) on the dynamics of model alveolar surfaces, and how this leads to physiological dysfunction. In Aim 2,
we will examine the liquid-solid domain morphology of clinical and model lung surfactants to understand the role
of cholesterol and interfacial curvature in modifying domain shapes and sizes to maximize LS respreading during
inhalation and minimize lysolipid adsorption. These first of their kind experiments and fundamental theoretical
approaches should determine the optimal lung surfactant composition that is resistant to lysolipid adsorption and
provide a new way of stabilizing the ARDS lung."

The Alabama Produce Program will not only help to sustain the produce industry but will assist
Alabama producers in growing the industry in the face of regulations and evolving market
expectations by aiding produce farms of all sizes and stages of development to meet food safety
requirements, access markets, and promote public health as sustainable agricultural businesses.
By focusing on outreach and education, technical assistance as well as compliance, our program
will assist all growers to adopt and implement on-farm food safety practices, furthering the
Food Safety Modernization Act's vision of preventing foodborne illness.
Continued assessment of the produce landscape in Alabama while focusing on produce covered
under the PSR and determining continued need of resources will be instrumental incontinued
implementation of the produce program. With farm inventory being the basis for the program
planning, establishing a complete and accurate inventory of produce farms will assist in
implementing corresponding objectives inthe CAP program.
Maintaining the current inspection program inplace so that ADAI is working together with all
produce programs nationwide in an integrated way to achieve our public health goals. By
working together nationally, ADAI will focus on quality and consistency in developing and
updating SOPs related to inspection program. ADAI will work to prioritize inspections
according to produce safety inspections assignment by using the PDAT tool and 'WinWam
software to pull the data needed to prioritizing inspections.
Continued development of ADAls compliance and enforcement program will be tailored to
Program Path C and the objective guidance provided by FDA. ADAI will utilize written procedures
for conducting compliance and enforcement activities that establish a risk-based process to
determine when a directed investigation, follow-up or re-inspection is needed. Framework for
compliance and enforcement progressive actions will be achieved by utilizing the current
compliance and enforcement guidance available.
Development of the ADAI Produce Safety Program will involve a multi-year process. It is
recognized by the Food Safety Division that developing a new Produce Safety Program and
achieving alignment with the Produce Safety Rule will require a further comprehensive self--
assessment and will involve efforts to focus on continuous program improvement and
innovation throughout and well beyond this 5-year grant period."
10894165,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the complex processes that govern the interactions between
Mtb and macrophages. The overall objective of this application is to investigate how the novel biophysical
phenomenon of phase separation impacts biological processes, specifically in the context of Mtb infection. A
detailed knowledge of the molecules that recognize and respond to pathogens is required to reveal how cells
fight infection; therefore, there is a critical need to understand how phase separation may influence or control
innate immune responses. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is an incredibly successful and deadly human
pathogen that infects one-quarter of the world's population. While interaction of Mtb bacilli and macrophages
activates numerous innate immune pathways, we have a limited understanding of how these complex networks
of host sensing molecules are regulated to work cooperatively. Furthermore, only a small subset of the many
secreted effectors used by M. tuberculosis have well-characterized functions. Recent studies have illuminated
the biological and cellular importance of liquid-liquid phase separation, a process by which proteins condense
into discrete droplets to alter their localization and function in a cell. Several proteins involved in the host
response to M. tuberculosis infection, like cGAS, TBK1, p62, and LC3, have been found to phase separate in
vitro, but how in vivo phase separation impacts host responses to infection is unknown. Preliminary studies have
found that these and other innate immune proteins form circular puncta in M. tuberculosis-infected cells that
resemble phase separated droplets. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that upon infection, pathogen-
sensing and post-translational modifications induce phase separation of host proteins and that Mtb modulates
these condensation events with its own phase-separating PE/PPE proteins. Here, a combination of novel
optogenetics tools, live cell fluorescent imaging, and host and bacterial genetics will be employed to probe the
biological consequences of phase separation of host proteins (Aim 1) and Mtb proteins (Aim 2). In addition,
directed and unbiased genetics approaches will be used to probe how post-translational modifications, and
especially ubiquitination in particular, contributes to phase separation during Mtb infection (Aim 3). This approach
is innovative in that it uses novel tools to specifically and precisely modulate phase separation in order to link
this biophysical process with meaningful cellular phenotypes. The proposed research is significant because it
will greatly expand our understanding of how macrophages destroy Mtb and advance efforts to combat Mtb
infection via enhancing host responses."
10835056,"Summary
Mammalian genomes are subject to a constant barrage of damage from metabolites, external agents, or
physiologic processes, including transcription and replication. Developing lymphocytes also target double-
strand breaks (DSBs) to antigen receptor loci during V(D)J recombination. To maintain genomic stability, DSBs
must be repaired with high fidelity, minimizing oncogenic alterations such as chromosomal deletions and
translocations. The DSB response extensively revises flanking chromatin via ATM-mediated phosphorylation of
the histone variant H2Ax, producing γH2Ax, which spreads for 100s of kb around a DSB. In somatic cells, most
of which are non-cycling, γH2Ax domains serve as chromatin-based platforms to facilitate repair by the non-
homologous end joining (NHEJ) and, likely, as adherent surfaces to hold broken chromosome ends together.
Indeed, ends are destabilized in cells lacking ATM or H2Ax, which have elevated levels of translocations.
Thus, a deeper understanding of mechanisms that coordinate DSB repair and sequester ends from the rest of
the genome remains an important goal. In this regard, links between repair, transcription, and epigenetic
landscapes around DSBs are emerging. A feature that bridges many of these processes is the 3D
conformation of chromatin, which determines the range of chromosomal contacts made by a persistent DSB.
The applicant has shown that the topological “environment” of a DSB in non-cycling lymphocytes determines
the spread and contours of γH2Ax domains, paralleling chromosome contacts of the break site. In addition,
transcription of genes within γH2Ax domains was repressed, perhaps minimizing introduction of new breaks
associated with RNA polymerase readthrough. A key finding from the prior funding period was that DSBs near
the border of topologically-associated domains (TADs) produce highly asymmetric γH2Ax platforms on each
chromosome end – one of which is very short – which may enhance disassociation of chromosome ends when
the break persists. Indeed, genomic alterations, including those associated with cancer, are enriched near
topological borders. Launching from these discoveries, the applicant now proposes to define the functional
relationships between chromosome topology and DSB repair outcomes. Overarching hypotheses for three
aims of the project are: (i) persistent DSBs adjacent to TAD borders will generate distinct profiles of repair
products due to unstable association of chromosome ends, promoting extensive deletions and translocations,
(ii) the mechanism of TAD formation, called loop extrusion, is required for generation of DDR platforms;
impairment of this process will deleteriously affect repair outcomes, and (iii) transcription within a γH2Ax
domain harboring a persistent DSB will enhance the probability of its deletional repair to an expressed gene
with which it contacts. Together, the proposed project will fill fundamental knowledge gaps about how DSB
responses integrate spatial, transcriptional, and chromatin-based mechanisms to sequester chromosome ends
for efficient repair, minimizing their oncogenic potential in somatic cells."
10880287,"Title: Improving chemotherapy of castration-resistant prostate cancer
Abstract
Androgen receptor (AR) signaling is essential for prostate cancer (PCa) development and growth, even in
castration-resistant PCa (CRPC), the lethal stage of the disease. Docetaxel is the standard treatment for CRPC
patients due to a combination of mitotic catastrophe and inhibition of AR signaling. Androgen signaling inhibitors
(ASI) are also used to treat CRPC post-docetaxel with limited success. Therefore, it is urgent to identify new
targets and develop novel approaches to treat CRPC that are resistant to the existing therapies. Brd4, a
conserved member of the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family of chromatin readers, promotes gene
transcription via interacting with core positive transcription elongation factor (P-TEFb), consisting of Cdk9 and
cyclin T1. Significantly, AR signaling-competent CRPC cells are preferentially sensitive to Brd4 inhibitor JQ1 as
JQ1 treatment disrupts AR recruitment to target gene loci, thus resulting in inhibition of AR signaling directly.
Furthermore, JQ1 enhances the efficacy of ASI in PCa. Loss-of-function mutations in E3 ubiquitin ligase
substrate-binding adaptor speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) cause stabilization of Brd4 and JQ1 resistance.
Thus, it will be of clinical significance to understand the regulation mechanism of Brd4 regulation and to develop
a new approach to cause Brd4 degradation even in the presence of SPOP mutations. The long-term goals of
this study are to identify novel and druggable signaling pathways that offer more effective treatment options for
patients with therapy-resistant CRPC. The objective is to define the role of polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) in regulating
Brd4 degradation and AR signaling, and to exploit this unique mechanism to develop a novel approach for
treatment. Our preliminary data show that Plk1 phosphorylation of Brd4 leads to its protein degradation even in
the presence of SPOP mutations. The central hypothesis is that Plk1-associated phosphorylation of Brd4 results
in its degradation, thus docetaxel-associated Plk1 elevation is one approach to overcome resistance to Brd4
inhibitors. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three Specific Aims - (1) to dissect how Plk1 phosphorylation
of Brd4 regulates AR signaling; (2) to understand how Brd4 phosphorylation contributes to PCa cell proliferation;
and (3) to analyze clinical significance of Plk1-associated Brd4 phosphorylation. These complementary aims will
be accomplished using biochemical analyses of signaling intermediates and employing genetic strategies with
PCa mouse models, culture systems and PCa xenograft methodologies. The rationale for the research is that it
will be the first to probe the importance of Plk1 to Brd4 and AR signaling and to examine whether a combination
of docetaxel and Brd4 inhibitor ABBV-744 is a novel approach to treat ASI-resistant CRPC. This contribution is
significant because it will (i) define the molecular mechanism by which Plk1 regulates Brd4 degradation and
AR signaling; and (ii) validate docetaxel as a therapeutic agent to enhance the efficacy of Brd4 inhibitors."

The Clinical Research and Data Informatics Core (CRDIC) will continue to build on the strong clinical and
informatics research infrastructure established by the COBRE-supported The Delaware Comprehensive
Sickle Cell Research Center (DE SCD COBRE). There is a tremendous need to improve the clinical and
research infrastructure for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). As a disease of minorities, there is a
longstanding history of disparate healthcare utilization, delivery, and availability as well as access to and
participation in clinical research. The mission of this project is to establish the DE SCD COBRE as a leader in
clinical and translational science providing children and young adults with SCD the opportunity to participate in
cutting-edge research, and to ensure delivery of the highest quality care. This will be accomplished by creating
a strong clinical research support infrastructure integrated with advanced principles of data science which will
open new clinical research opportunities, enable SCD researchers in the successful conduct of impactful
research, and improve patient care for a complex and underserved patient population affected by SCD. As an
integrated clinical and informatics core, the CRDIC will have the capability to support translational clinical
projects and to assist junior researchers in overcoming complex obstacles associated with this type of work.
This core will create a centralized platform that provides all of the resources required to support SCD research
and clinical quality improvement efforts, including project management, regulatory support, guidance and
mentorship of junior investigators and expertise in data analytics and data science techniques. A
quality/outcomes team, paired with community-level support, will ensure delivery of cutting-edge, high-quality,
evidence-based, safe care to patients throughout Nemours, address barriers to care and foster adherence.
Use of a SCD-specific common data model and a scalable electronic health system-informed analytic
knowledgebase will support clinical care and facilitate cohort discovery and data reporting for research and
allow for the sharing of data across institutional boundaries. This platform will facilitate the long-term
sustainability of the DE SCD COBRE."

The IMPACT Center brings together a transdisciplinary team focused on optimizing EBP implementation for
youth receiving mental healthcare in low-resourced community settings. Our goal is to accelerate the reach and
impact of EBPs by partnering with stakeholders to develop methods and toolkits that address three challenges
to high-quality EBP implementation in these settings. The Administrative Core is designed to ensure that the
IMPACT Center functions effectively, has a scientific and public health impact that is greater than the sum of its
component parts, and transforms mental health care delivery. Led by Co-Directors Lewis and Dorsey, the Ad-
ministrative Core includes the Steering Committee, and two external groups that drive IMPACT Center Activities:
a Scientific Advisory Board and a Stakeholder Advisory Committee. These committees come together annually
to review IMPACT's progress and influence, provide input about priorities and future directions, and engage in
iterative refinement of IMPACT's methods and resources. The Administrative Core is motivated to address four
strategically developed aims to ensure that the Center has near-term impact on clinical practice, by optimizing
EBP implementation: (1) Maximize learning and impact, (2) Foster synergy and integration in the IMPACT Cen-
ter, research, and practice community, (3) Grow investigator capacity to apply practical implementation science
optimization methods and (4) Evaluate and iteratively improve our Center's impact. The Administrative Core for
the IMPACT Center provides programmatic oversight and support for iterative testing and refinement of IMPACT
methods in three exploratory projects and a pilot grant program. Through our yearly Deep Dives and Symposi-
ums, we will create dedicated opportunities for strategic future planning with our transdisciplinary team, stake-
holders, trainees, pilot leads, and external advisory board. Through the Administrative Core's coordinated activ-
ities, we will grow research capacity for optimizing EBP implementation across 5 levels: (1) mentoring for trainees
on our exploratory projects and (2) pilot projects (e.g., students/junior faculty working with IMPACT Faculty to
carry out project activities, and publish and present results); (3) partnerships with the Society for Implementation
Research Collaboration and the Implementation Research Institute to fund trainees, offer workshops, office
hours, site visits, and 1:1 mentoring; (4) in-person training for local programs, (5) wide dissemination for the
global community (e.g., MOOCs, toolkits). Our dissemination and outreach plan includes a public website with
content across four areas: general communication; project-specific materials, updates and findings; a relational
database or clearinghouse curating evidence and optimized strategies from our exploratory and pilot projects;
and our methods, toolkits, and web-based trainings. We focus dissemination and outreach on the practice com-
munity to ensure public health impact, including our own networks, practitioner-focused websites, conferences,
and an IMPACT mailing list. Our formative and summative evaluation plan affords careful tracking and refinement
of internal processes, with metrics that ensure research progress and impact, and public health benefit.

10892060,"METHODS CORE SUMMARY
The IMPACT (Optimizing EBP implementation for clinical IMPACT) Center is focused on optimizing evidence-
based practice (EBP) implementation to improve treatment quality and clinical outcomes in youth mental health
services. The Methods Core will develop, test, refine, and disseminate innovative, pragmatic methods for ad-
dressing three challenges to optimizing EBP implementation: identifying and prioritizing implementation deter-
minants, matching implementation strategies to prioritized determinants, and optimizing strategies before de-
ployment and evaluation. Methods Core faculty will iteratively refine methods to address these challenges
through exploratory projects and pilot studies conducted in collaboration with the Washington State EBP Initia-
tive, an academic-community partnership that supports EBP delivery for children and adolescents. With each
iteration, the methods will be evaluated with input from multiple stakeholders using Center-wide measures of
acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness. Refined methods will be transformed into pragmatic toolkits con-
taining checklists, protocols, guidelines, templates, and resources that practice partners and researchers can
use to support their implementation efforts or research projects. Aim 1 of the Methods Core focuses on refining
a suite of state-of-the-art, practical methods for optimizing EBP implementation drawn from health care policy-
making, public health and global development, product design and technology development, and Agile Science
approaches to organize evidence and engage the end user in all aspects of implementation research. Specific
methods include rapid evidence reviews and ethnography, design probes, causal pathway diagrams, user-cen-
tered design methods, and optimization of research designs. These methods are new, recently introduced, or
underutilized in implementation science and mental health services research. Methods Core Faculty will hold
user-centered design sessions with stakeholders to ensure that refined methods are robust and pragmatic
enough for use by the practice and research communities. Aim 2 will provide operational support to the research
projects. The Methods Core is led by and staffed with methodological experts with sufficient FTE to work with
the leads of exploratory projects and pilot studies to develop and refine their ideas and designs; participate in
regular study meetings; contribute project- and study-relevant methods expertise; and provide general, statisti-
cal, and qualitative analysis support. Aim 3 will support evaluation of the Center's research productivity and
public health benefit. The Methods Core will develop metrics and methods to assess the quantity, quality, reach,
and impact of the research products, as well as the reach and impact of the Center's research findings and
methodological advances in the practice community. Aim 4 will disseminate the Center's methodological ad-
vances and Center-generated resources. The Methods Core will serve as a national consultation resource, de-
velop toolkits that practice partners and researchers can use to optimize EBP implementation, and disseminate
evidence and resources from the Center via a user-centered relational database and publicly accessible website."
10892063,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Although up to 80% of mental health services for youth are currently provided in schools, few students receive
evidence-based practices (EBPs). Even when organizational supports are in place, implementation ultimately
rests with providers' motivation for change. Individual provider behavior change is critical to achieve high-quality
implementation and positive outcomes for youth. For the public to benefit from the decades of research invested
in EBP development, implementation strategies that target provider motivation are needed.
 Beliefs and Attitudes for Successful Implementation in Schools (BASIS) is a four-hour, facilitated, group-
based, blended implementation strategy designed to augment standard EBP training and consultation
procedures by improving provider engagement and motivation. Using strategic education, motivational
interviewing, and social influence strategies, BASIS aims to impact key, theoretically-derived, individual-level
mechanisms associated with clinician behavior change—attitudes, social norms, and perceived behavioral
control—to improve treatment quality (i.e., fidelity), and youth outcomes. In two previous trials, BASIS delivered
in-person demonstrated evidence of feasibility, appropriateness, and efficacy, but it could be optimized for
greater scalability and efficiency, so that it can be used widely to positively impact clinicians' engagement.
 Consistent with the goals of the IMPACT Center, the current project will focus on increasing BASIS scalability
by (1) optimizing BASIS to include only the most essential components for activating its target mechanisms and
(2) adapting its delivery to a web-enabled digital platform. We will build causal pathways using theory and
stakeholder input (practice community, youth), enroll representative end users, and use rapid analogue methods
(RAM) to efficiently identify and test BASIS components, as well as prioritize them for digital deployment.
 Aims of this study are to apply IMPACT Center methods in order to: (1) Identify and prioritize BASIS
components via causal pathway diagramming; (2) Conduct tests of prioritized BASIS components using RAM to
inform the development of an optimized eHealth adaptation of BASIS (eBASIS); and (3) Test the impact of
eBASIS on EBP fidelity and youth outcomes in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Key organizational factors
(e.g., leadership, implementation climate, school characteristics) will be measured as covariates during the RCT.
Promising findings would support an R01 application for a confirmatory trial evaluating the impact of eBASIS on
fidelity and youth outcomes. We anticipate that the eBASIS implementation strategy will be readily scalable and
could enhance the impact of EBP integration efforts to improve treatment quality and outcomes for youth in the
education sector and other low-resource community settings."

physically within a dedicated suite and share infrastructure and facilities developed for TB research in the
International Center for Public Health (ICPH) building on the Rutgers-NJMS campus. Core lead is Dr. Alland,
with Co-Leads - Mr. David Hom and Ms. Francesca Escaleira.
Specific Aims:
1. Develop and operate an administrative (fiscal, regulatory), operational (scientific, logistics) infrastructure
 and data management center capable of supporting proposed clinical, animal & translational protocols.
2. Maintain fiscal compliance and site reimbursement procedures per NIH policy.
3. Communicate and work with NIH program staff to monitor study progress and achieve milestones.
4. Coordinate and collaborate with other TBRU programs to leverage expertise across network.
 A Management Plan and system will be deployed to maintain the operations of the TBRU, including the
financial, administrative/regulatory compliance activities, communications within the Unit, its committees and
with TBRU-N, programmatic DMID and TBRU meetings, sponsor interactions, progress reports, supplement
submissions, and assist Principal Investigators with project assessments. Appropriate and experienced
financial analyst, administrative coordinator are available for program conduct and post-awards management.
 An existing Data Center - Data and Operations Management Center (DOMC) in the Center for Emerging
Pathogens (directed by Dr. David Alland) will provide a comprehensive Data Management Plan with
appropriate systems to organize, coordinate and validate the collection of clinical data, specimens (MTB
strains and blood samples) from the proposed clinical protocols. The DOMC houses trained, experienced
staff, who have worked in Uganda and Brazil in clinical studies. Validation and management of data collected
will be maintained by the Data Center, monitored by the Clinical Core. A specimen repository system
(FreezerPro web-based platform) will be maintained for collected MTB strains and blood samples (described
in Clinical Core). The DOMC will also assist with the collection of basic and translational data from TBRU
investigators to help with data management and structure required by the Systems Biology Core for statistical,
genomic, and systems biology analytic approaches."
10874590,"The TBRU Clinical Core will take overall responsibility for all human subjects’ studies in the proposed TBRU
protocols, and will work closely with the Data and Operations Management Center (DOMC) in the
Administrative Core to coordinate approved protocols and unit-wide scientific activities in concert with
scientific decisions of the TBRU. The primary objective of the Clinical Core is to ensure the implementation and
conduct of the clinical research studies align with the scientific and translational aims of the TBRU projects and
scientific cores by providing support for; 1. Protocol development, 2. Implementation and operations, 3. Quality
assurance and control, 4. Sample banking and inventory; 5. Data collection, and 6. Epidemiological and
statistical analysis. The Clinical Core will monitor the clinical operations, sample collection and processing, and
data collection from study initiation through close out, to ensure that all activities are conducted in compliance
with local and international regulations and ethical standards. The clinical studies will be conducted at
Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda and the Núcleo de Doenças Infecciosas (NDI) in Vitória, Brazil. The
Core leads Dr. Whalen and Ms. Douglass will work closely with the Lead Investigators at each site to ensure
timely completion of all project milestones. In a prospective cohort of HHC of TB patients in Uganda and a
retrospective cohort study in Brazil (Projects 1 and 2) and one in Uganda (Project 1) we will characterize the
immediate and long-term consequences and interactive effects of bacterial and host heterogeneity with a focus
on the underlying immune mechanisms that we hypothesize to be critical determinants of the natural history of
TB. These studies involving human participants must be conducted with careful design and oversight with our
Brazilian and Ugandan partners to guarantee the safety and protection of all participants, the study team, and
the integrity of the data. The Clinical Core will coordinate with the Administrative and Systems Biology Core, and
under the direction of the Principal Investigators, to accomplish these objectives, implement the clinical protocols
for projects 1 and 2 at the collaborating sites in Brazil and Uganda, and to establish an inventory of human clinical
specimens, isolates of Mtb and clinical epidemiological data to be utilized across projects 1, 2, 3 and 4."
10874592,"SYSTEMS BIOLOGY CORE ABSTRACT
 This overall TBRU Program seeks to understand how both host and bacterial heterogeneity act together to
promote TB clinical phenotypes such as transmission, disease progression, and drug tolerance. These two
subjects (biological heterogeneity and clinical phenotypes) are emergent properties of intracellular networks and
of multicellular interactions, respectively, rendering this overall topic challenging to study by conventional
hypothesis-driven research approaches. Systems-level analyses are required in order to account for the
biological complexity imposed by cellular network and multicellular interactions and advanced computational
techniques are required to elucidate biological understanding from the increasingly large quantitative datasets
generated by modern advanced experimental platforms. The Systems Biology Core is designed to meet both of
these needs, providing advanced bioinformatics, biomedical data science, and network modeling analysis
services to support each Project in this Proposal. This Core is led by Drs. Evan Johnson, Shuyi Ma, and Jason
Yang, each with extensive subject-matter expertise in diverse computational and systems biology analytical
approaches, and each of whom actively collaborates with other investigators from this TBRU on diverse
tuberculosis research projects. The Systems Biology Core will aid in the standardized processing and analysis
of data from each Project, generation of experimentally testable hypotheses for each Project, and integrative
analyses of mechanisms connecting clinical phenotypes across Projects. Two key strengths of this Core that
differentiate it from other computational cores and that enable this TBRU to uniquely study clinical biospecimens
are: (i) the extensive expertise in using biomarker signatures such as PREDICT29 to detect incipient and
subclinical TB disease, expanding the range of clinical Mtb strains and host cells that can be studied; and (ii) the
extensive expertise in multiscale cellular network modeling and interpretable machine learning, expanding the
breadth and precision of biological hypotheses that can be generated from each set of experimental data.
Investigators in this TBRU have uniquely developed Mtb gene regulatory and metabolic network models, which
will be used by this Systems Biology Core to form condition-specific models of host and Mtb cell physiology
corresponding to experimental samples for each Project. These models will not only enable the Core to
deconvolve the large experimental datasets generated in this Program, but will also enable the Core to directly
predict causal gene regulatory and metabolic gene and pathway mechanisms that underlie each of the key
clinical phenotypes studied from these clinical samples: TB transmission, disease progression and drug
tolerance. These models and analyses will enable direct integration between Projects, allowing this TBRU to
determine how these clinical phenotypes may be mechanistically linked. Together, this Core will synergize with
each and with all Projects to mechanistically bridge host and pathogen heterogeneity with clinical outcomes."
10839954,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hispanics/Latinos are at increased risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD)
compared to non-Hispanic Whites. While factors underlying this disparity are not well understood, increased
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk among Hispanics/Latinos is likely to be a contributory factor. Pathological
changes of ADRD begin years before clinical symptoms become evident and interventions are most likely to
confer benefit in the earliest stages of ADRD. There is a pressing need to develop tools to detect the earliest
manifestations of ADRD, particularly in Hispanics, who develop symptoms of ADRD at earlier ages, yet are
diagnosed at more advanced disease stages than other groups. A variety of behaviors show changes in the
preclinical stages of ADRD, including sleep, gait speed, and physical activity, among others. Recent innovations
in mobile technology now offer novel ways to collect, track, and analyze these behaviors passively and
unobtrusively, as a person engages in their daily life. Our preliminary work demonstrated that the application of
machine learning models to passively-collected digital health data from smartphones and wearables
differentiated persons with and without mild cognitive impairment with 85% accuracy in a primarily non-Hispanic
White sample. Guided by the NIA Health Disparities Research Framework, we propose to leverage artificial
intelligence (AI)-powered analytics and insights, coupled with readily available sensors in consumer electronics
(smartphones, wrist-worn wearables), to identify digital biomarkers of ADRD risk, with a focus on vascular
contributions to dementia, among Hispanics/Latinos. Augmenting an existing cohort study of Hispanics/Latinos
residing in Southern California, the proposed study has three principal aims: Aim 1 involves determining digital
signatures of ADRD risk among Hispanics (N=300; aged 50-70 years) using integrated passive mobile sensing
features, derived from smartphones and wrist-worn wearables, and machine learning methods. ADRD risk will
be defined by cognitive status and CVD risk burden (diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, obesity,
smoking) and will also incorporate apolipoprotein E (APOE-ε4) and plasma-based AD biomarkers for further
classification of ADRD risk. Aim 2 investigates sex differences in digital signatures of ADRD risk and Aim 3
examines the impact of sociocultural factors (e.g., language use, acculturation) on these signatures. We will also
investigate whether changes in digital data features predict longitudinal neurocognitive change over a span of
three years in a subset of Hispanics with and without ADRD risk. Housed within a renowned research institution
at the vanguard of ADRD research and engineering innovations, the proposed study includes a multidisciplinary
team with expertise across all aspects of this cutting-edge proposal. Recognizing the value of a community-
engaged research approach, we have partnered with community stakeholders to ensure the relevance of our
study to the Hispanic community. Our work could revolutionize early detection of ADRD and reduce ADRD
disparities by developing a low burden, low-cost approach to identify ADRD risk among Hispanics."
10888302,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Millions of patients are placed into a reversible state of unconsciousness by anesthesiologists for life saving
surgeries every year. The basic goals of anesthetic care are to reliably extinguish consciousness for the
duration of surgery and afterwards to swiftly return the patient to their baseline cognitive state. Neither of these
goals can be reliably achieved today, however. Some patients regain consciousness during surgery. Episodes
of consciousness are not reliably detected by current intraoperative EEG-based monitoring and can result in
post-traumatic stress and anxiety disorders. In contrast, other patients take a long time to resume normal
cognition. This can manifest as postoperative delirium and cognitive derangements. Postoperative delirium
affects millions of patients, costs 34 billion dollars annually, and can be a harbinger of ongoing cognitive
decline. Such persistent impairments in cognitive function can last for many months. It is presently unclear
why some patients experience peri-anesthetic complications while other patients that receive
seemingly identical anesthetics have an uneventful perioperative course. To address this, we propose to
study individual-based anesthetic pharmacology rather than the previous population-based approach.
We have recently developed experimental and computational methods to quantify individual-based
measures of anesthetic responses in mice. Using these methods, we discovered that conventional
population-based pharmacological concepts such as drug potency are not sufficient to describe individual
responses. We identified two independent measures that do capture the range of individual responses:
sensitivity and resistance to state transitions (Rst). Sensitivity describes how often an individual is awake or
anesthetized at an anesthetic dose, while Rst describes how frequently transitions happen between awake and
anesthetized states. We demonstrated that pharmacology can differentially modulate sensitivity and Rst. We
also demonstrated that chemogenetic activation of an arousal pathway – the locus coeruleus – decreases Rst
without a change in drug sensitivity. Because Rst is completely obscured in population-based pharmacological
studies, we hypothesize that Rst is the hidden variable that may help explain why some patients
experience peri-anesthetic complications while others do not.
We propose to investigate the mechanisms through which the locus coeruleus decreases Rst. Using
pharmacologic and genetic approaches, we will identify the neurotransmitter systems used by the locus
coeruleus to modulate Rst. Separately, we will identify the effects of the locus coeruleus on neurophysiologic
state change, including correlates of behavioral Rst, using a high-density EEG system developed by our lab.
Finally, we will identify the neuronal pathways through which locus coeruleus acts to modulate Rst. The
proposed lines of investigation will clarify how activity of the locus coeruleus influences individualized
anesthetic responses, and will be an important step towards delivering personalized anesthesia."
10840376,"Dementia and the prodromal stages of cognitive decline, together, affect approximately 25-30% of older adults
across the United States (U.S.). Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) has been linked to a 111% increased
risk of developing dementia of any type, even after controlling for potential confounders such as traumatic brain
injury (TBI). Therefore, PTSD may be an important target for early prevention of cognitive decline and potential
progression to dementia. Most studies on PTSD and cognition have used a cross-sectional study design and
have not examined important potential effect modifiers (e.g., sex and APOE4 carrier status), leaving a gap in
our fundamental understanding of the effect of PTSD on longitudinal trajectories of cognitive functioning.
Further, although PTSD is more prevalent in women, most research on PTSD and cognition has been
conducted in men. This proposal is of timely public health importance, as the pre-pandemic lifetime prevalence
of PTSD in the U.S. was 6%, but post-pandemic epidemiological findings have indicated a rise to
approximately 32% among young adults. COVID-19 events have also resulted in PTSD symptoms without
meeting Diagnostics and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) Criterion A. Therefore,
critical research gaps in our understanding of the effect of PTSD on cognitive aging include: 1) prospective
investigation wherein temporal sequencing and rate of cognitive decline can be evaluated in the context of
PTSD, 2) testing the potential modifying effects of sex and APOE4 carrier status on the relationship between
PTSD status and cognitive decline and, 3) understanding whether Criterion A is necessary when determining
the relationship between PTSD and cognitive decline. Aims 1 and 2 will leverage existing data from the
National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC). In adults aged 55+ years, multilevel modeling and
interaction analyses will determine the impact of PTSD status on trajectories, rate, and temporal sequence of
domain-specific cognitive decline and will test sex and APOE4 carrier status as potential effect modifiers. For
Aim 3, men and women participants, aged 65+, with and without Criterion A trauma, will be recruited and
multiple regression will be used to unambiguously clarify if PTSD severity (Criteria B through E) is associated
with cognitive functioning without meeting Criterion A. This K01 award will provide training and mentorship in
aging health, cognitive aging, sex-specific health effects of PTSD, neuropsychology of PTSD, longitudinal
study design, and advanced statistics and propel the PI to become an independent investigator with expertise
in the effects of traumatic stress and biopsychosocial factors on cognitive aging, with a sex-specific focus and
in alignment with Goals B-3, B-4, and F-4 of NIA’s Strategic Directions 2020-2025."
10814848,"The proposed project, which responds to NOT-AG-21-033 (Health Disparities and Alzheimer’s Disease), is the
first longitudinal and epidemiological examination of justice-involvement and dementia. Americans who
experience justice-involvement, moving from the community to incarceration and from incarceration back to the
community, are aging rapidly. Moreover, justice-involvement disproportionately impacts persons of color and of
low socioeconomic status, who are also at high risk for all forms of dementia yet are frequently excluded from
dementia-related research. This study will contribute to our understanding of health disparities in dementia by
evaluating the inter-relationship among incarceration, dementia, and a number of important social risk factors
and multi-morbidity factors over time in a national sample. We will optimize the Veterans Health
Administration’s (VHA) capacity to access Incarceration History Files from the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS). We propose to leverage a longitudinal “prison release” cohort which we created for
a different NIH-funded study and supplement (R01 MH117604 and S1). This cohort includes >30,000
individuals enrolled in both Medicare and VHA, who reentered the community at age ≥50 (between 2008-2018)
following an incarceration. We will enhance this cohort to include all veterans who were age ≥50 between 2008
to 2022, including those incarcerated at any point during that timeframe and who were released, those who
remained incarcerated (no community reentry), and those never incarcerated, for a total of more than 46,000
justice-involved veterans among 10.5 million veterans. Using this rich, longitudinal dataset, we have the
unprecedented opportunity to develop social risk factor profiles and multi-morbidity profiles associated with risk
of incarceration among those with dementia (Aim 1) and risk of dementia among those released from
incarceration (Aim 2). Access to VA and Medicare data provides more complete outcome ascertainment, thus
increasing the opportunity to determine if these profiles differ according to dementia subtypes (e.g.,
Alzheimer’s Disease, vascular, frontotemporal, mild cognitive impairment (MCI)). We will also make novel use
of transition models to evaluate probabilities of experiencing distinct pathways (e.g., pathway to entering
incarceration, to being released from incarceration, to developing dementia) and determine precursors that
predict these pathways (Aim 3). We will evaluate all Aims within health disparity populations such as non-
Hispanic Black, Hispanic, native/indigenous groups and those experiencing indicators of poverty (e.g.,
homelessness and socioeconomic disadvantage). This study has substantial public health significance. It will
inform strategies to mitigate risk of patients with dementia entering incarceration, will delineate those at highest
risk of developing dementia after incarceration so as to inform prison-to-community transitional care planning,
and will identify prime intervention points where optimizing dementia care could reduce health disparities
between those with and without justice-involvement and even within the justice-involved."
10923856,"SUMMARY: DATA PROCESSING AND ANALYSIS CORE (DPAC)
The overall goal of the Data Processing and Analysis Core (DPAC) is to provide consistent and cost-effective
expertise in biostatistics and research informatics for all projects in the proposed research program of the
University of Southern California Tobacco Centers of Regulatory Science (USC TCORS). Key functions and
support provided by DPAC include initial consultation on study designs, followed by provision of tools for survey
platform and database development, especially tracking and monitoring databases within projects and sharing
data across projects; generation of interim reporting on progress for each study; generation of cleaned, coded
(consistently across projects), and documented analytic datasets for each project, as well as initial univariate
and summary analyses for common data elements. The DPAC team consists of a multidisciplinary group of data
specialists and experts who are experienced in the collection, management, and analysis of longitudinal and
experimental study data, and reporting these in the published articles. The DPAC will support and facilitate inter-
disciplinary research by providing essential services related to data management, biostatistics, and integrated
analytics to enable modern data-driven investigations. Supporting informatics and biostatistical needs for a
diverse group of investigators will include: (1) working with the Administrative Core and Projects to create user-
friendly platforms for data collection and sharing; (2) demonstrating and optimizing the process of data accuracy
and usability through data cleaning and codebook development; (3) investigating project-specific hypotheses in
collaboration with project personnel using analysts and expertise from the Core; and (4) supporting study results
interpretation and publication of research studies. To achieve these goals, the DPAC has the following Specific
Aims: (1) To work with USC TCORS investigators to develop front-end survey platforms for capturing data and
back-end data processing mechanisms to optimize the timeliness, efficiency, accuracy, and usability of data;
and (2) To provide biostatistical methodological support for developing and implementing data analysis plans
and interpreting data."
10923860,"PROJECT SUMMARY: MEASURES AND MATERIALS CORE (MMC)
The tobacco product market and policy landscape evolve quickly, necessitating rapid development of accurate
assessments and materials for tobacco regulatory science. Thus, there is a need for flexibility to ensure that
measures and product materials used in survey and experimental research maintain their timeliness, accuracy,
and relevance. Additionally, the US population is diverse across several demographic characteristics, and some
populations are disproportionately impacted by tobacco use and targeted marketing practices, necessitating
survey and experimental research to develop and use culturally appropriate measures. Thus, many subfields
within tobacco regulatory science have an ongoing need for their measures and materials to be regularly adapted
to keep pace with these rapid changes in the tobacco market and regulatory landscape, and to provide data
relevant to diverse populations. To meet this need, the Measures and Materials Core (MMC) will use creative
and rigorous methodologies to rapidly develop, refine, validate, and characterize assessments and materials for
internal use by USC TCORS projects and for outward dissemination to the national network of tobacco regulatory
scientists. The MMC will collect information from key sources to ensure USC TCORS stays abreast of
developments in the tobacco market and policy landscape and addresses the needs of diverse populations. The
MMC will also work with TCORS project investigators to execute measure and materials development,
refinement, and validation designed to impact their projects. This includes a priori development survey
assessment and psychometric testing (with Data Processing and Analysis Core [DPAC] analytic assistance) for
projects 1-3 and creating experimental stimuli that are realistic and representative of the market for Projects 2
and 4. MMC will also coordinate flavoring constituent analysis of concept flavor products identified in the research
projects (Projects 1 and 2) to triangulate self-reports of the sensory attributes about these flavors (e.g., fruity)
and the flavoring chemicals detected in them. The MMC has three aims: (1) To collect information about changes
in the tobacco market and policies, and how different populations are impacted, to identify needs for measure
and material adaptations; (2) To develop, refine, and validate measures and materials for use in research; and
(3) to obtain information on flavorings and other constituents in non-combustible flavored products, including
concept flavors. Overall, the MMC will provide a critical service to the projects and pilot investigators and the
tobacco regulatory science community. In addition to serving the USC TCORS, the MMC will work with the
Administrative Core, which will disseminate the MMC’s novel measures, experimental stimuli, and constituent
analysis results, as well as supporting documentation outward on the TCORS website and other national venues."
10716175,"Homelessness in Veterans is a widespread problem, and a priority at the national level. Despite substantial
progress in providing housing for Veterans, a fundamental problem remains: Permanent housing is a
necessary, but not sufficient, condition for successful community integration. Community integration (e.g.,
social integration with friends and family; capacity for work and productive activities) is essential for long-term
mental and physical outcomes. Providing housing is only the first step in facilitating recovery among homeless
Veterans; once housed, they need different types of assistance to integrate into communities.
For these reasons we are proposing an RR&D Center at the VA Greater Los Angeles (GLA) with a mission to
understand and to improve community integration in homeless and recently-housed Veterans. The Center will
build on an existing Research Enhancement and Award Program (REAP) at GLA and will expand it
substantially. The Center will establish an interdisciplinary community of researchers, educators, and clinicians
to generate intervention and translational research to improve community integration for these Veterans. This
Center will fill a critical gap -- rather than focusing on factors that confer risk for homelessness in Veterans, this
team of investigators will apply their skills to the neglected problem of community integration for homeless and
recently-housed Veterans. It will also attract and develop clinical researchers and trainees who focus on this
critical problem, with components such as a Pilot Grant program and a Postdoctoral Fellowship program. It is
fitting that this RR&D Center will be based at GLA, which has the largest homeless program of any VA in the
nation, and is current providing housing for > 9,000 Veterans who have experienced homelessness.
The overarching goal of this Center is to understand and improve community integration for homeless and
recently-housed Veterans. To achieve these goals, the Center will be organized around three research focus
areas (FAs) that rely on four service Cores. The FAs include:
 · FA1: To develop and validate innovative assessments of factors that predict community integration,
 including cognition (social and nonsocial) and motivation, as well as community integration.
 · FA2: To identify determinants that predict improvements in community integration.
 · FA3: To develop and adapt interventions to enhance community integration for homeless and recently-
 housed Veterans.!
These FAs form a sequential translational pathway. The sequence involves three key steps: First, develop
innovative methods to assess key variables that are linked to community integration in homeless Veterans.
This is a critical need – for example, key aspects of community integration in homeless Veterans cannot be
adequately captured with existing measures. Second, use those methods to identify the determinants of
community integration. The identification should be with sufficient precision at the level of specific cognitive or
motivational sub-processes. Third, use that information to guide choice of and develop interventions for
recovery-related therapeutic targets. The intervention approaches can range from psychosocial procedures to
medications to novel methods such as neurostimulation. The trials can range from early-stage proof-of-
concept studies in which novel treatments are evaluated in terms of feasibility in relatively small samples to
later-stage adaptations of existing interventions that have been validated in other populations, but not validated
in homeless populations. Findings from this Center, including validated interventions, would be then passed to
VA health services investigators for implementation and dissemination.
The Center will support four service Cores. These include: the Recruitment Core, the Clinical Assessment
Core, the Data Management and Statistics Core, and the Technology Core. All four of these Cores will provide
critical services to each of the three FAs."
10911146,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for the deaths of approximately 1 million Americans annually. Studies
show that Veterans over the age of 50 are at increased risk for CVD. Atherosclerosis, the most common form
of CVD, is a disease of sterile inflammation characterized by accumulation of plaque in the arteries. Initially,
low density lipoproteins (LDL) accumulates in the vasculature where they subsequently become oxidized
(oxLDL) and cause damage to local tissue. This results in activation of innate and adaptive immunity and
production of oxLDL-specific IgG. Titers of oxLDL-specific antibodies and the resulting immune complexes
(oxLDL-ICs) are known to correlate with disease severity, it is unknown if oxLDL-ICs play a role in disease
pathogenesis. ICs can regulate inflammation in atherosclerosis by interacting with Fc gamma receptors
(FcgRs) expressed on the surface of DCs. Activating (FcgRI/III) and inhibitory (FcgRIIb) FcgRs mediate
opposing functions in DCs, shifting the balance between pro-inflammatory DC activation and tolerogenic
responses. Our published studies demonstrate that oxLDL-ICs prime the inflammasome more robustly than
free oxLDL. This was primarily through induction of FcgR and TLR cross talk activating the Card9, Malt1,
BCL10 complex to amplify NF-B nuclear translocation. In addition, absence of the inhibitory FcgRIIb on
CD11c+ cells increased atherosclerosis in female but not male Ldlr-/- mice and injection of Ldlr-/- mice with
oxLDL-ICs increases plaque size. Preliminary data suggest that oxLDL-ICs may license DCs to promote TH17
responses and inhibit IFN-g production by TH1 cells. The increase in IL-17 producing T cells is dependent on
IL-1b while decreased IFN-g is likely due to increased IL-23 in response to oxLDL-ICs. These data suggest
that oxLDL-ICs can act as endogenous danger signals, or DAMPs, and have the ability to shape the
inflammatory response in atherosclerosis. Using both in vitro and in vivo models, the long term goal of this
study is to determine the mechanisms by which oxLDL-ICs signaling through FcgRs modulate immunity in
atherosclerosis. We hypothesize that 1) oxLDL-ICs licence DCs to enhance pro-inflammatory CD4+ T cell
responses through mechanisms involving epigenetics and metabolism; 2) oxLDL-ICs potentiate inflammation
in atherosclerosis via trained immunity in DCs, and 3) many of these responses are dependent on sex-
hormones. Being afforded the opportunity to test this hypothesis will allow us to continue to make “big picture”
conclusions regarding the role of oxLDL-ICs in CVD. In addition to hypothesis-driven studies, we will conduct
metabolomic and epigenetic studies that will allow us to make novel and innovative hypotheses. Understanding
the pathological relevance of molecules known to accumulate and positively correlate with CVD severity is
vital, and this avenue of research has important therapeutic potential for Veterans. Approximately 25% of the
more than 8 million current Veterans Affairs (VA) medical system users suffer from ischemic heart disease due
to atherosclerosis. This is alarming, especially considering that atherosclerosis is a disease for which no cure
exists, despite over 50 years of active research on the subject. In addition, studying the role that sex hormones
play in our observed responses is critical given that close to 10% of Veterans are women. These studies will fill
significant gaps in knowledge concerning atherosclerosis and will ultimately lead to improved treatment of our
Veterans and their families."

10877985,"Major histocompatibility complex class-II (MHC-II) proteins are encoded by HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP α/β gene
pairs and function by presenting processed antigenic peptides to CD4+ T cells thereby initiating and/or sustaining
adaptive immune responses. MHC-II expression is transcriptionally regulated and expressed constitutively in
antigen-presenting cells, such as B cells, but may be induced in non-immune cells by IFNγ. Thus, MHC-II-
mediated immune responses and adaptive immunity is controlled primarily at the level of transcription. All MHC-
II genes are coregulated by a common set of proximal promoter transcription elements and factors of which only
CIITA is cell type limiting and induced by IFNγ. Several years ago, we showed that MHC-II gene expression was
also modulated by a series of transcriptional insulator elements that bound CTCF and cohesin and that these
elements were the focal points of long-range chromatin interactions between each other and MHC-II promoter
regions. Together these elements formed a three-dimensional chromatin architecture that favored gene
expression. Indeed, as B cells differentiated into plasma cells and lost MHC-II expression, this architecture was
also lost. While this model is correct and has stood for the last 5 years, we now provide exciting new evidence
that it is incomplete. New data presented herein identifies a super enhancer (SE) located between the HLA-
DRB1 and -DQA1 genes (termed the DR/DQ-SE) that is required for maximal expression of the system and for
its “3D” architecture. CRISPR/Cas9 mediated deletion of the DR/DQ-SE in Raji B cells resulted in decreased
expression of HLA-DR and -DQ, reduced ability to stimulate an allogenic CD4 T cell response, and loss of
promoter associated histone modifications and all local CTCF-insulator interactions. Additionally, while it is
accepted that MHC proteins are highly polymorphic, non-coding polymorphisms within cis-regulatory regions of
the MHC-II locus are more extensive and strongly linked to MHC-II expression and disease, suggesting that
transcriptional regulation of MHC-II expression by the DR/DQ-SE is a key component of immunity and disease.
Aside from what we present, nothing else is known about this region and how it works. To fill this gap in
knowledge, this application seeks to understand how this SE functions to control MHC-II expression and
immunity. Aim 1 will elucidate fundamental molecular and biochemical components of the DR/DQ-SE and
determine how polymorphisms affect its function. Aim 2 will determine the range of the SE’s influence and test
a model of how it may operate. Aim 3 will examine how the SE is established, and decommissioned. Together,
our studies will provide insight into how human (SNP) diversity influences immunity, and ultimately how this
critically important set of immune system genes are regulated. The knowledge gained will have broad
implications on gene regulation and will provide new insight into how the initial steps of adaptive immune
responses may be controlled. Our results could have important implications for future immune-based therapies
and vaccinations, and for treatments of infectious disease, autoimmunity, cancer, and transplantation."

10867500,"Project Summary/Abstract - Viral Testing Core
Continuous, accurate surveillance for agents of concern is an essential requirement for maintenance of a SPF
breeding colony. In 2009 we transitioned from testing at off-site laboratories to performing all screening assays
at the Tulane National Primate Research Center's (TNPRC) Pathogen Detection and Quantification Core
(PDQC). The PDQC is administratively located in the Division of Microbiology and was established at the TNPRC
in 2004. The primary mission of the PDQC is to provide diagnostic services to the Division of Veterinary Medicine
for establishing and maintaining SPF nonhuman primate colonies. A secondary mission is to provide research
support to investigators. The development of onsite viral testing capabilities has resulted in reduced costs,
eliminated shipping of samples, reduced turnaround time, and provided a platform for easy expansion for
detection of additional agents. Quality assurance of the TNPRC SPF surveillance program is supported by the
participation of the PDQC in proficiency panels testing from the Pathogen Detection Working Group (PDWG), a
subgroup of the Breeding Colony Management Consortium (BCMC) in the NIH Nonhuman Primate Research
Consortium (NHPRC), and from the External Quality Assurance Program Oversight Laboratory (EQAPOL)
Luminex program. This section of the application focuses on the function of the Viral Testing Core, techniques
used for identification and detection of the target viruses, assay performance and validation, and current and
future expansion of testing capabilities.
The Aim of this core is to assure the SPF status of the colony through continued viral testing of existing breeding
colony animals and all offspring. The SPF4 colony will be tested a minimum of twice each year for all four target
viruses: Type D simian retrovirus (SRV), simian T-lymphotropic virus (STLV), simian immunodeficiency virus
(SIV), and herpes B virus (BV) for SPF4. The eSPF colony will be tested at the same frequency for rhesus
rhadinovirus (RRV), simian virus 40 (SV40), simian foamy virus (SFV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), simian varicella
virus (SVV), and lymphocryptovirus (LCV) in addition to the SPF4 agents. Infants derived from SPF4 parents for
inclusion in the eSPF colony will require quarterly testing. Characterization of the colony beyond the targeted
agents supported by the U42 grant will be funded through other sources and require the development and use
of additional assays for other pathogens of potential interest."
10867504,"Project Summary/Abstract - MHC Genetic Typing Core
The SPF rhesus macaque breeding colony for AIDS research at the Tulane National Primate Research Center
(TNPRC) is part of an extensive evidence-based, integrative, program that incorporates best practices in health
surveillance, husbandry, preventive medicine, and behavioral and genetic management. The goals of the genetic
management program are to 1) maintain genetic diversity and minimize inbreeding to support sustainable
populations and 2) characterize class I MHC alleles in support of HIV/AIDS research activities. To this end, the
TNPRC Genome Bank collects and stores materials from more than 9000 unique animals, with additional
animals collected as they are produced. The colony is characterized for ancestral geographic-origin and
parentage confirmed using a pan-NPRC SNP panel. MHC typing for all animals includes testing for 10 class I
alleles, which serves the needs of most core and affiliate scientists, and MHC deep sequencing in collaboration
with the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center for targeted research programs. Over the previous grant
funding period whole genome sequencing (WGS) has been added for 164 key breeders, focusing on those males
with the greatest reproductive output in the breeding colony, and whole exome sequencing (WES) from 72
additional animals. Support has also been obtained for WGS on an additional 200 animals during the budget
period for this proposal. These efforts are supported by core TNPRC scientists in collaboration with researchers
from other NPRCs and research institutions. These efforts are made in concert with the broader NPRC
community through consortia activities, notably, the Nonhuman Primate Genetics and Genomics Working Group.
Presently, the efforts of the genetic management program and MHC Genetic Typing Core are to continue to
provide high-quality MHC characterization of the SPF breeding colony in support of HIV/AIDS research, to
integrate MHC typing with other genetic and genomic data currently being characterized at the TNPRC, and to
develop additional support structures for sharing this data with the research community. These efforts ensure
the SPF rhesus macaque breeding colony is healthy, sustainable, and of maximal translational research value
to the broader HIV/AIDS research community."

The goal of this proposal is to develop an engineered T cell therapy with potential of translation into human
testing. We will develop a clinically optimized combination antigen sensing prime-and-kill circuit T cell for precise
recognition and enhanced elimination of mesothelioma, a rare disease with poor prognosis. The work is built on
our recent progress in T cell engineering and novel tumor antigen discovery: (1) a prime-and-kill dual antigen
AND-gated circuit with fully human components (dubbed as SNIPR for SyNthetic Intramembrane Proteolysis
Receptors) that facilitate clinical translation. (2) A novel tumor specific cell surface antigen ALPPL2 (aka ALPG)
that is expressed in mesothelioma but not any of the normal human tissues except for the placenta. Paired with
the credentialed mesothelioma antigen mesothelin, the ALPPL2 SNIPR → CAR circuit T cell enables precise
temporal and spatial control of T cell activation at the site of the tumor, minimizes on-target off-tumor toxicity,
reduces tonic signaling and T cell exhaustion, and maintains multifunctional T cell states. The circuit design is
modular and flexible and can be induced to locally deliver additional immune modulatory payloads such as
cytokines to further improve efficacy. In addition, our research has shown that SNIPR → CAR circuit T cells are
capable of effectively targeting antigens that are heterogeneously expressed in tumors, a common pitfall for
therapeutic efficacy. We propose to perform translation-enabling studies: (Aim 1) Optimize antibodies for SNIPR
T cell construction, and develop biomarker for patient stratification. (Aim 2) Engineer and evaluate humanized
clinical grade SNIPR → AND logic T cells in vitro and in vivo. (Aim 3) Evaluate SNIPR-engineered prime-and-
kill circuit T cells in killing tumor with heterogeneous target antigen expression. Successful completion of the
project will enable us to move the SNIPR → CAR circuit T cell to translational development and identify via the
biomarker appropriate mesothelioma patients for clinical testing."

Despite much effort to identify mechanisms underlying amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal
lobar degeneration dementia (FTLD or FTD), effective treatments remain elusive. Motoneuron (MN) excitability
dysfunction remains the most tightly linked to ALS disease pathology. Much research has reported on disease
alterations in the excitability mechanisms of MNs. However, these data often conflict, as hyperexcitability,
hypoexcitability, and normal excitability have all been seen in animal models of ALS. Such inconsistent data
obscure the role of these excitability changes (i.e., neuroprotective or detrimental). Most of these conflicting
reports are seen in mutant super-oxide dismutase (SOD) models of ALS, the most commonly studied mouse
model of ALS. Our data obtained (via our active grant) from the aggressive G93A SOD mouse model of ALS
suggests that both hypo- and hyperexcitability disease changes might take place concurrently within diseased
MNs. Here, we propose to examine a recent, novel rNLS8 mouse model that recapitulates pathologic
Transactive-response DNA-binding Protein 43 (TDP43) inclusions seen in upper and lower MNs in >90% of ALS
patients, leading to neuronal loss in the brain and spinal cord. TDP43 is specifically seen in most sporadic-onset
ALS cases; thus, between them, the G93A and rNLS8 models represent most ALS, and also FTD, cases.
However, to date, excitability dysregulation has not been examined in this model. Thus, our objective is to
characterize the novel rNLS8 TDP43 mouse model of ALS and compare this data to our existing data from G93A
mice. Both models demonstrate very different disease scenario and progression, yet ultimately both lead to MN
loss and death. By comparing and contrasting mechanisms of excitability dysregulation between these models,
we expect to parse the roles that individual alterations play in ALS/FTD disease pathology via 3 Specific Aims:
Aim 1: Determine MN and synaptic excitability in the rNLS8 model. It is currently unknown whether MN
excitability is altered in the rNLS8 model – as in other ALS models – and whether synaptic excitability dysfunction
is also involved. Thus, we will measure intrinsic MN and synaptic excitability in the rNLS8 model via
electrophysiology recordings, at early, middle, and late disease stages, then contrast them to G93A data.
Aim 2: Determine the roles of ion channels and synaptic inputs in the death of spinal MNs in rNLS8 mice.
We will measure expression levels of ion channels and synapses in spinal MNs of rNLS8 mice at early, middle,
and late disease stages, then contrast them to G93A data.
Aim 3: Determine the roles of ion channels & synaptic inputs in the death of cortical neurons in rNLS8
mice. Loss of cortical neurons in rNLS mice recapitulates key aspects of ALS-comorbid FTD. To examine if
excitability mechanisms involved in the death of spinal MNs are also involved in FTD dementia, we will measure
expression levels of ion channels and synapses in cortical/subcortical neurons of rNLS8 mice at early, mid, and
late disease stages."

 Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States and is particularly
problematic in U.S. veterans, who are at an increased risk for lung cancer resulting in approximately 5,500
excess veteran deaths per year. This is largely due to the late stage at which lung cancer is diagnosed. However,
resection of pre-malignant and stage I non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) results in cure in most patients.
Current recommendations include screening high-risk patients for lung cancer by low dose computed
tomography (CT) of the chest due to a 20% relative risk reduction in mortality. However, debate exists on the
patient population most likely to benefit from this intervention. Pre-malignant lesions such as atypical
adenomatous hyperplasia and early lung adenocarcinomas, identified as nodules on chest CT, are often
indistinguishable from benign nodules, which can lead to aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic interventions,
and possibly harm, in patients with benign nodules or delayed diagnosis in those with NSCLC. Better diagnostic
and therapeutic targets are needed to detect and treat pre-malignant and early non-small cell lung cancers when
cure is likely. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying transition from pre-malignant to frankly
malignant non-small cell lung cancers is essential for more accurate and timely diagnosis and ultimately
improved survival.
 Genomic instability is a hallmark of cancer, and altered DNA repair pathways have been associated with
increased risk of lung cancers. The DNA repair protein, Xeroderma Pigmentosum Group C (XPC) gene
expression is decreased by chronic cigarette smoke in mice, and low XPC is identified early and often in human
lung adenocarcinomas. Our laboratory has discovered a critical role of XPC in protection against development
of cigarette smoke and carcinogen-induced lung adenocarcinoma development. We recently found that XPC
protects against histologic progression of mouse NTCU-induced lung squamous cell carcinomas. Our preliminary
data suggests progression of carcinogen-induced lung cancers in XPC deficient mice is associated with
increasing copy genomic complexity with higher histologic grade.
 Based on these findings, we hypothesize that decreased DNA repair by XPC leads to pre-malignant
lesions with characteristic mutational and epigenetic signatures that predict progression to lung cancer. We
propose to study this in three aims, using human samples of pre-malignant and early NSCLC specimens
complemented by our well-established, XPC-deficient urethane lung adenocarcinoma progression model. In Aim
1, we will identify the impact of XPC in transition from pre-malignant to early and late adenocarcinoma pathologic
grades by performing single cell sequencing on specimens isolated from urethane-treated XPC deficient mice,
and confirm orthologous changes in humans using archived genomic data (NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus)
and mechanistic in vitro studies. In Aim 2, we will determine the mechanistic impact of immune evasion on lung
carcinogenesis using PD-L1 inhibitor, atezolizumab, in our mouse lung adenocarcinoma progression model, and
define characteristic immunogenotypic characteristics of atezolizumab-resistant lung adenocarcinomas. Finally,
in Aim 3, we will determine the impact of DNA repair on critical genomic and epigenetic changes in pre-malignant
and early human lung squamous cell carcinomas. DNA repair capacity, determined by host cell reactivation
assay, will be compared to bronchial epithelial cell dysplasia regression or persistence, and clonal genomic and
transcriptomic differences studied in dysplastic samples which progressed/persisted vs regressed. Studying the
mechanisms and genomic instability in early NSCLC development may allow for earlier recognition and novel
therapeutic targets in early non-small cell lung cancer."

This is an application for a VA Merit Award Research Grant for Dr. Mark McCauley, a physician-scientist and
staff Cardiologist/Electrophysiologist at the Jesse Brown VA Medical Center in Chicago. This award will provide
Dr. McCauley with the support necessary to validate carbon nanotube fibers (CNTf) as a biocompatible,
electrically conductive substance able to enhance ventricular conduction in the heart. To achieve these goals,
Dr. McCauley has assembled a team of Electrophysiologists (Drs. Avitall and Razavi) and Bioengineers (Drs.
Pasquali, Avitall, and Perin), who are Consultants on this application.
 Reduced myocardial conduction velocity (MCV) is a significant contributor to lethal cardiac arrhythmias
including monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Due to underlying
traditional coronary disease risk factors, and military-related exposures such as PTSD and agent orange,
Veterans are more susceptible to developing VT and SCD. Previously, restoration of native myocardial
conduction has not been possible because of lack of a biocompatible material that combines strength, fatigue-
resistance, conductibility, and low impedance to charge transfer properties. Recently, CNTf have been described
that combine these properties into a manufactured suture-like material. Published and preliminary data from our
laboratory suggest that CNTf are capable of transferring electrical charge between electroanatomically distinct
areas of myocardium, such as across ventricular scar and the AV junction. Additionally, CNTf are biocompatible
materials with a unique high capacitance, low impedance material/tissue interface. The central hypothesis is that
CNTf have such a low tissue-material impedance, that source-sink mismatch between electroanatomically
separated tissues is sufficiently reduced to facilitate trans-myocardial conduction within cardiac tissue. To test
this hypothesis, three Specific Aims are proposed: Aim 1 – Assess whether CNTf reduce source-sink mismatch
across ventricular scar; Aim 2 – Determine whether CNTf increase MCV across post-infarction ventricular scar
and prevent VT; Aim 3 – Determine the conductive stability, tensile strength, and inflammatory response to long-
term CNTf implants. The innovation of our project is that for the first time, we are able to bridge electrically
separate tissues with CNTf to facilitate trans-myocardial transfer of electrical signal. Our expected outcome from
completion of the proposed Aims is an enhanced understanding of the mechanisms underlying CNTf-based
electrical conduction, and the development of strong pre-clinical data necessary for the future application of CNTf
to reduce adverse cardiac events in Veterans."

Multi-center clinical trials increasingly utilize quantitative diffusion imaging (DWI) to aid in patient management
and treatment response assessment for translational oncology applications. A major source of systematic bias
in diffusion was discovered originating from platform-dependent gradient hardware. Left uncorrected, these
biases confound quantitative diffusion metrics used for characterization of tissue pathology and treatment
response leading to inconclusive findings, and increasing the requisite subject numbers and trial cost. Technical
remedy was defined by University of Michigan investigators and motivated our parent AIP involving the three
dominant MRI manufactures. The current AIP merged expertise among commercial scientists/engineers and
academic researchers, and resulted in successful design and development of prototype correction tools to
eliminate systematic diffusion weighting bias in quantitative DWI applications across diverse clinical MRI
platforms. As a result, two vendors have implemented prototype tools on their respective scanner platforms for
correction of mean tissue diffusivity metric widely used in oncology trials. Furthermore, feasibility of retrospective
correction across all three vendor platforms was demonstrated for the repeatability cohort of ACRIN 6698 breast
cancer imaging trial. Our AIP participation with clinical trial cooperative groups and quantitative imaging
consortia revealed that the most efficient route for adoption of developed technology on clinical platforms is by
vendor implementation. Additional need was noted for flexible integration with advanced acquisition protocols
and analyses using multiple b-values to accurately quantify complex metrics beyond mean diffusivity. To address
these needs, the renewal AIP will extend our collaborations to include two additional academic cancer imaging
centers to integrate and validate developed practical correction tools in five active clinical oncology trials, as well
as enable application to advanced tissue diffusivity models. These tools will eliminate systematic cross-platform,
cross-exam variability to facilitate longitudinal and multi-institutional translational cancer research that utilize
quantitative diffusivity metrics. Success of this project will further enhance accuracy and precision of cancer
detection and monitoring. These goals will be achieved through Aim1: deployment of DWI bias correction tools
for application in multiple cancer imaging trials, and through Aim2: correction integration with advanced DWI
protocols and tissue models.
Academic team of the proposed partnership consists of recognized experts in quantitative diffusion imaging
standardization and translation to clinical oncology trials. The PI institution has active research agreements with
three dominant clinical MRI manufactures with prior record of successful implementations for the developed
technologies. Accomplishment of the project goals will eliminate significant instrumental bias that confounds
current multi-center/multi-platform clinical trials that employ quantitative DWI."

 3 Between one to two-thirds of new HIV infections among MSM are attributable to sex with main partners (i.e.,
 4 male couples).1,2 48% of HIV-positive MSM in 5 US cities who were HIV tested in CDC's NHBS project were
 5 unaware of their status,3 suggesting the potential for high levels of unknown sero-discordance among male
 6 couples. Research has also illustrated the role that relationship dynamics (e.g., HIV-specific social support,
 7 constructive communication, sexual agreements) have in shaping male couples' risk for HIV4-41; this has also
 8 been shown longitudinally, strongly suggesting that promoting positive relationship dynamics is a significant
 9 intervention point for reducing HIV transmission among male couples.42-44 There is also evidence at-risk male
10 couples can work together towards shared HIV prevention and care-related goals, including PrEP and U=U/TasP
11 that rely on adherence and resultant viral suppression, leading to increased health and reduced likelihood of
12 onward HIV transmission.45-55 Innovative and tailored solutions are needed to meet the HIV prevention and care
13 needs of at-risk male couples. Our solution is to leverage our strong findings from the preliminary work we
14 conducted in the US (R34 pilot RCT & mixed method acceptability project)59-62 to propose a highly novel, 5-year
15 project to revise and update an existing, eHealth couples-based HIV/STI prevention toolkit intervention that
16 showed promise for reducing couples' HIV risk. The intervention is theoretically grounded in Couples
17 Interdependence Theory for health behavior change.63,64 We will first apply the remaining stages of the ADAPT-
18 ITT model65 with elements of human-centered design66-69 to incorporate at-risk, sero-concordant negative and
19 sero-discordant male couples' prevention and relationship needs while also including the latest science in
20 HIV/STI prevention. We will then conduct a 16-month RCT with 300 at-risk male couples using a delayed,
21 educational control condition of 8 months. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) examine efficacy of the intervention on
22 couples' a) formation and adherence to a risk-reduction plan and agreement, b) relationship functioning, c) self-
23 reported and biomarker confirmed indicators of risk (sexual behavior and STI), and engagement in HIV
24 prevention (PrEP adherence) and care (ART adherence); 2) evaluate use of the intervention over time by using
25 three different data sources; 3) explore moderating and mediating effects on couples' outcomes a-c. Our proposal
26 has high Public Health significance given the HIV disparities and importance of attending to couples' unique
27 relationship and prevention needs. Our innovative, accessible, and tailored intervention will fill a gap in current
28 prevention services by offering couples a personalized program. We believe results from the fully powered RCT
29 will show efficacy toward improving sustained HIV prevention outcomes among at-risk male couples in the US.
30 The scientific premise and rigor will further allow us to understand the processes that couples work together
31 to manage HIV/STIs in their relationships. Our next steps may include conducting a Type 1 Hybrid Trial to assess
32 for effectiveness and explore best practices for future implementation.70"

The current SARS-COV2 pandemic has brought to light that more efforts are needed to evaluate the pandemic
potential of viruses that can spill over in human populations. To assess the pandemic potential of specific
viruses, over the next five years my lab will ask if similar viruses caused epidemics not only during the recent
documented past, but during the much longer time scale of human evolution. Viruses that caused epidemics in
the past are indeed the most likely to cause epidemics again in the future, and hundreds of viral epidemics
likely plagued human populations during their evolution. This work will fill gaps in knowledge on epidemics in
ancestral human populations, and by doing so, will enable a better assessment of the viruses that represent a
future pandemic threat.
 To study ancient epidemics, my lab will exploit host genomic adaptation driven by ancient viruses.
Arms races with viruses have shaped the host immune system by driving a large number of adaptations. I
recently showed that viruses left abundant signals of adaptation not only in immune genes, but across the
entire human genome. The lab will examine signals of adaptation left by specific viruses in human genomes, to
detect, date, and functionally characterize ancient epidemics. To this aim, we will develop new statistical tools
based on recent advances in machine learning and in the reconstruction of Ancestral Recombination Graphs
(ARGs). These new approaches with increased power to detect and date genomic adaptation will allow us to ask
the following questions:
1) Which viruses drove ancient epidemics in human evolution?
My lab will create deep learning tests with high power to detect complex genomic adaptation within the past
~200,000 years of human evolution.
2) When did specific viruses drive ancient epidemics?
We will use ARGs and Approximate Bayesian Computation to date ancient epidemics, by dating the host
adaptive events driven by specific viruses.
3) Which functional host genetic changes were selected during ancient epidemics, in which
genes, and how do they influence genetic susceptibility to present viruses?
We will investigate regulatory adaptation to viruses and the overall impact of virus-driven host adaptation on
the genetic susceptibility of different human populations to specific present viruses, thereby providing
virologists with strong candidate host genes for further inquiry.
 My lab is uniquely suited to decipher ancient epidemics by linking host-pathogen interactions together
with the latest developments in the population genomics of adaptation."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) currently affects more than 5 million Americans and is a significant burden for
patients, caregivers, and our healthcare system. Currently, there is no known cure for AD, and approved
therapies do not reverse the underlying pathogenesis or inhibit disease progression. Amyloid deposits and
their associated amyloid beta oligomers (Aβ) are linked to multiple cellular dysfunctions in the brains of AD
patients and in animal and cell culture models of AD. Some of these dysfunctions include microtubule
instability, loss of dendritic spine density, and depressed hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). Many
hypotheses have been put forward to explain the routes by which Aβ contributes to these phenotypes.
However, a unified mechanistic understanding has not yet been achieved. This project builds on previous
studies that have shown that Aβ inhibits the activity of a select set of microtubule motor proteins. Among them,
Kinesin-5/EG5/KIF11 is of particular interest due to its diverse functions, which include regulating microtubule
stability, microtubule polymerization, and dendritic architecture, all of which are negatively impacted by Aβ.
Based on these findings, the long-term goal of this project is to determine whether Kinesin-5 activity may
serve as an effective target for preventing or reversing A β -induced AD phenotypes: 1) by
overexpressing Kinesin-5 to maintain its activity, or 2) by using small molecule drugs we identified in a
screen that block Aβ-mediated inhibition of Kinesin-5 activity. In order to address these goals we are
using a mouse model system in combination with cell culture and biochemical tests that aim to 1) Determine
whether Kinesin-5 overexpression improves learning and memory in a wild-type mouse without AD pathology
and whether Kinesin-5 overexpression rescues Aβ-induced AD phenotypes in the an AD mouse model; 2)
Determine whether Kinesin-5 overexpression improves long-term potentiation (LTP) and whether deficits in
LTP caused by Aβ are rescued by Kinesin-5 overexpression; and 3) Determine whether Kinesin-5
overexpression impacts neural process outgrowth, spine density, and morphology in wild-type and 5xFAD
mice. Our proposed research will also provide an increased understanding of the role of Kinesin-5 activity in
regulating diverse neuronal processes. The clinical significance of this work comes from the identification of
underlying mechanisms linked to aberrant cellular functions that may uncover an entirely new therapeutic
approach to AD. The innovative aspects of this project are rooted in the identification of Kinesin-5 as a
potential therapeutic target for the treatment of AD and include: 1) interrogating of as yet uncharacterized
functions of Kinesin-5 in learning, memory, and AD-related phenotypes; and 2) pursuing an entirely new
avenue of investigation into desperately needed AD treatments using Kinesin-5 activity as a therapeutic target."
10807033,"Hippocampus (HIP)-dependent cognition is regulated by a variety of different types of environmental stimuli,
but the mechanisms by which the environment initiates and/or modulates behavior are not fully understood.
Adult inbred mice display wide variability in performance on HIP-dependent cognitive tasks, and there is
highly significant negative correlation between levels of endogenous BMP signaling in the HIP and baseline
cognitive performance. Further, exposure to exercise or environmental enrichment increases expression of
the BMP-inhibitor, noggin, in the HIP and attenuates BMP signaling concurrent with enhanced cognitive
performance and increased neurogenesis. Similarly, antidepressants increase neurogenesis in association
with behavioral changes, and these changes are mediated by an increase in noggin expression and a
reduction in BMP signaling in the ventral hippocampus. Reducing BMP signaling in adult mice by ventricular
infusion, transgenic overexpression, or viral overexpression of noggin in the HIP reproduces many effects of
exercise on cognitive and affective behavior and on neurogenesis. In the HIP, noggin is localized within
dentate granule neurons (GC),and membrane depolarization promotes noggin release from cultured GC.
Sonic hedgehog signaling promotes even greater levels of release of noggin by cultured GC. Disruption of
cilia (IFT88 knockout) or inhibition of transport to cilia (Rab8a/b knockdown) depletes noggin from cultured
GC. In toto these observations suggest that BMP signaling plays a central role in regulating both
neurogenesis and HIP-dependent behavior, that BMP signaling is regulated by activity-dependent release of
noggin by GC, and that cilia regulate noggin expression and release by GC. This proposal will test the
hypotheses that:
1) Release of noggin by dentate gyrus GC is a crucial link between environmental stimuli and both cellular
changes in the hippocampal neurogenic niche, and hippocampus-dependent behavior.
2) Environmental signals transduced through primary cilia and neuronal activity cooperatively regulate
expression and release of noggin to regulate neural progenitor proliferation.
3) The DG circuitry is structured to support the transfer of information between largely parallel cortical and
subcortical systems via interactions between mature and immature neurons. Activity-dependent release of
noggin alters this functional connectivity leading to changes in hippocampus-dependent behavior."

 The aggressiveness of triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) is, in part, due to their metastatic
behavior, propensity to recur rapidly and dismal low response to standard-of-care
chemotherapies. TNBCs are associated with the worst prognosis and clinical outcomes,
especially in African American (AA) women. Interestingly, the incidence rate of TNBC is more
than 2-fold higher in AA women, compared with their Caucasian American (CA) counterparts who
have the same disease. These racial-associated disparities in outcomes, that remain poorly
understood, are significant even after controlling for socioeconomic and treatment variations, and
suggest the contribution of differences in tumor biology to these disparities in cancer outcomes.
We identified YB1, a multifunctional gene, as a potential biological driver of TNBC disparities in
AA women. We also found that the oncogenic signaling of YB1 may play a major role in activating
the invasion-metastasis cascade and therapy resistance of TNBC in AA women. YB1 expression
levels are significantly higher in AA tumors and are strongly associated with poorer overall survival
in AA TNBC patients. YB1 nuclear localization/phosphorylation (S102) is also correlated with
cancer stem cell phenotype, and resistance to chemotherapy in TNBC tumors of AA origin. Based
on this strong evidence, we developed the overarching hypothesis that YB1 oncogenic signaling
is a major contributing factor to differences in disease outcomes between AA and CA TNBC
patients. This hypothesis will be addressed by investigating the biologic and clinical significance
of YB1 signaling axis in TNBC disparities. Our proposal will also attempt to better elucidate the
complex interactions between genetics, environment, socioeconomics and lifestyle that may
contribute to the observed differences with the ultimate goal of developing and implementing more
efficacious population-based strategies to improve health equity for this vulnerable population.
Our specific aims will (1) Determine the impact of YB1 signaling (expression, phosphorylation and
nuclear localization) in tumorigenicity and chemoresistance in TNBC cell lines and tumors of AA
origin; (2) Determine the impact of novel combination therapies targeting YB1 to alleviate
progression and metastasis of AA TNBC tumors; and (3) Determine whether YB1 signaling can
predict racial disparities and chemoresistance in TNBC, based on transcriptomics and
immunohistochemistry.
 We are very confident that our innovative proposal will make great contributions to the field of
cancer disparities, especially for AA women with TNBC, and will identify new YB1-based
therapeutic options for this devastating cancer that is disparately affecting AA women."

This resubmitted project evaluates the role of the positive valence system (PVS) in the interpersonal processes
of disclosure, help-seeking, and safety planning in a transdiagnostic sample at risk for suicide. Interpersonal
factors are central to contemporary models of the transition from suicide ideation to behavior, and social
resources are key to effective suicide safety planning. Yet, interventions to promote informal help-seeking
have been ineffective to date, and almost half of people do not disclose suicidal thoughts to anyone prior to
attempt. Basic research on the mechanisms underlying social approach or avoidance behaviors in suicide
could help identify new targets for more effective suicide prevention interventions. Here, we focus on
investigating how the reward system (i.e., valuation, responsiveness and/or learning) is involved in engaging in
social outreach behaviors before and during crises. In this proposal, we will recruit participants with either
affective or psychotic disorders, stratified by current active suicidal ideation. Purposive sampling of both
affective and psychotic diagnoses enables inclusion of a group with a similar high background risk of suicide,
yet varying PVS and negative valence system (NVS) profiles. We will use a measurement burst longitudinal
design which integrates lab-based tasks with bouts of ecological momentary assessment and passive sensing.
Participants will be followed longitudinally for 12 months. Among lab-based tasks, we will administer our
validated dyadic paradigm that simultaneously evaluates PVS and NVS components in a simulated social
affiliation and disclosure context, and enables facial emotion coding and natural language processing of
speech. In Aim 1, we will administer lab-based tasks and focus on evaluating the impact of PVS on suicide-
related social affiliation, including social elements of the standard safety plan (e.g., people to contact in crisis)
and help seeking opportunity within each individual’s social network. In Aim 2, we will use mobile assessments
to model short-term dynamics of suicidal ideation and whether and to whom ideation is disclosed. In Aim 3, we
will integrate lab-based and ecological momentary assessment data streams to build and test integrated
predictive models of suicidal behavior over 12 months, evaluating stability of effects across affective or
psychotic syndromes. We will evaluate whether social affiliation dynamics mediate the relationship between
PVS components and suicidal ideation and behavior. The intended products of this research include an
integrated dataset informative for translational interventions to improve long-term and acute suicide prevention.
Innovative aspects of the proposed study include the lab-based dyadic social affiliation task, use of mobile
health and computational methods to model dynamic aspects of help seeking, and the focal comparison of
psychotic and affective syndromes. This proposal aligns with RDoC by probing connections across domains
(PVS, NVS and Social Processes) in a transdiagnostic sample, and is also responsive to the NIMH Strategic
Plan (Aim 2.2, Aim 3.2) and the NIMH Notice of Special Interest in Digital Mental Health."

The innate immunity is the first line of defense of our body against invading pathogens such as viruses and
bacteria. The cGAS/STING pathway is a recently discovered innate immunity pathway that plays critical roles
in eliminating cytosolic DNA virus. Viral DNA in the cytosol is detected by the DNA sensor cyclic-GMP-AMP
synthase (cGAS), which becomes active and synthesizes the second messenger cyclic-GMP-AMP (cGAMP)
using ATP and GTP as the substrates. cGAMP binds and activates adaptor protein Stimulator of Interferon
Genes (STING), a transmembrane protein normally residing on the endoplasmic reticulon (ER) membrane.
cGAMP-bound STING polymerizes and translocates to the Golgi apparatus, where it activates the downstream
signaling proteins the TBK1 kinase and the transcription factor IRF3. This signaling pathway ultimately leads to
a plethora of anti-viral responses, including the production of interferons, induction of inflammatory responses
and autophagy. The cGAS/STING can also launch immune responses to self-DNA, such as damaged DNA
leaked into the cytosol in cancer cells. In fact, mounting evidence in the past few years have demonstrated the
cGAS/STING pathway plays a critical role in immune responses to cancer through several mechanisms.
cGAS/STING signaling can boost the effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD1 and anti-PD-L1
antibodies in cancer therapy, whereas loss of function of the cGAS/STING pathway leads to severe immuno-
deficiency and impaired response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. STING therefore has become a major
target for cancer therapy in recent years, with several agonists undergoing clinic trials at present. One major
goal of this project is to advance our understanding of the fundamental regulatory mechanisms of STING by
using cryo-EM structural analyses in combination with biophysical and cell-based functional assays. In
addition, our preliminary data revealed a novel cryptic agonist binding site in STING, opening the door to the
development of a completely new class of STING agonists. The second major direction of the project is
therefore to further characterize this new binding site in STING, and design more potent and specific agonists
based on the structures. New STING agonists will be synthesized and tested in biophysical and functional
assays, and structurally characterized using cryo-EM. The new agonists could be used as chemical tools for
further mechanistic studies, and may be developed into anti-cancer drugs in future."

Brain function emerges from the activity of hundreds of neuronal types embedded within a complex network of
neural circuits. Although the formation of neural circuits is guided by the emergent activity, many of the initial
‘wiring instructions’ are genetically encoded. Mutations in genes associated with neurodevelopmental
psychiatric disorders may disrupt the early stages of cell type and circuit development, leading to long-lasting
deficits in function. Our overarching goal is to identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms that govern
neuronal cell type specification and their early connectivity preferences. Disease associated mutations serve
as a discovery platform of molecular mechanisms that likely disrupt connectivity. In this project, we focus on
the development of the human thalamus and early stages of thalamocortical pathway formation. Given the
central role of the thalamocortical pathway in sensory, motor, and cognitive tasks, understanding its
development in the human brain would be fundamental to studies modeling the consequences of mutations
associated with multiple neuropsychiatric symptoms. Remarkable differences between mouse and human
development of the thalamocortical pathway pose a scientific challenge for studying the impact of genetic
variants on human thalamocortical pathway development, especially during its early formation. Innovations of
in vitro differentiation protocols for induced pluripotent stem cells have recently enabled studies of early
formation of the human thalamocortical pathway using organoids. As an exemplar, we propose to investigate
thalamocortical and corticothalamic axon outgrowth in organoids derived from patients with 22q11.2
microdeletion syndrome, which is associated with schizophrenia, autism, movement disorders, developmental
delays, and epilepsies. Neuroimaging studies in 22Q11 Deletion Syndrome (22Q11DS) patients have identified
differences in functional thalamocortical connectivity between patients and healthy control, establishing a
scientific premise for examining thalamocortical pathway development in cells with 22q11.2 microdeletion.
Investigations of neurodevelopmental defects using stem cell models will be complemented by a parallel effort
using a mouse model of human 22q11.2 microdeletion. We will identify molecular changes in cell fate
specification of thalamic neurons, and compare axonal outgrowth phenotypes in control and cells with the
22q11.2 microdeletion. Our preliminary data implicate FOXP2 transcription factor activity in mediating
thalamocortical pathway growth phenotypes in 22q11.2 DS thalamic neurons. The proposed project will
establish groundwork for studying the growing list of rare genetic mutations with high effect size discovered
through large scale studies of Autism, ADHD, and schizophrenia patients for their role in brain development,
focusing on the development of the thalamocortical pathway."

Polymicrobial infections are inherently more complex than monospecies infections, and this complexity has
been a significant barrier to both a fuller appreciation of pathogenic mechanisms, and to the development of
effective measures to control or prevent the disease. Periodontal diseases typify polymicrobial diseases, and
are among the most common infections of humans. Although certain organisms, such as Porphyromonas
gingivalis, are considered key pathogens, it is the polymicrobial community as a whole that initiates and
drives the disease. Interspecies interactions within communities shape overall pathogenic potential, and
work supported by this project has uncovered a dynamic and multilevel interaction between P. gingivalis
and its community partners. The pathogenicity of P. gingivalis can be constrained by the streptococcal
diffusible metabolite, para-amino benzoic acid (pABA), which is as a precursor of de novo folate synthesis in
the physiologically essential one-carbon metabolism (OCM) pathway. However, as physically integrated
communities develop, interspecies co-adhesion results in suppression of streptococcal pABA production, and
additionally, partner organisms such as Streptococcus gordonii and Fusobacterium nucleatum, enhance
overall community pathogenicity. Sensing of both pABA and interspecies physical contact by P.
gingivalis is transduced through a protein tyrosine phosphorylation signaling circuit. The tyrosine kinase
Ptk1 controls flux through OCM as well as the production of virulence factors, including the gingipain
proteases which can modulate interactions with neutrophils. Indeed, Ptk1 is required for pathogenicity in
both murine abscess and alveolar bone loss models of disease. In this proposal we will define the role of
Ptk1 as a master regulator which can integrate OCM with pathogenicity. In the first Aim we will examine how
Ptk1-mediated phosphorylation of gingipains is necessary for their processing and secretion. We will
determine where non-phosphorylated gingipains remain localized in P. gingivalis and investigate which
components of the type IX secretion system machinery malfunction in the absence of phosphorylation.
Additionally, we will follow post-translational maturation of non-phosphorylated gingipains to uncover the role
of phosphorylation in catalytic removal of the N-terminal peptide, the haemagglutinin domains, or the C-
terminal domain as is required for the assembly of fully activated proteases. In the second Aim, we shall
functionally dissect the contribution of phosphorylation to the activity of the pABA synthesis enzyme PabC, and
decipher a negative feedback loop whereby pABA can inhibit Ptk1. Aim 3 will address the impact of Ptk1 on
the activation state of neutrophils and their potential for tissue destructive responses to P. gingivalis.
Completion of this project will provide novel insights into the context-dependent pathophysiology of P.
gingivalis, which could ultimately be translated into therapeutic strategies designed to target the
community-based pathogenesis that underlies periodontal disease."

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer diagnosed in childhood. Although survival rates
for childhood ALL have improved in recent decades, ethnic disparities persist. Compared to most other ethnic
groups, Latinos experience both a higher incidence of childhood ALL and poorer survival. The etiology of these
disparities is complex and not fully understood, but ethnic-specific biological variability contributing to increased
treatment-related toxicities are an important, under-studied cause of disparities in outcomes. For example, the
antimetabolite agent methotrexate, a key component of curative ALL chemotherapy, results in dose-limiting
clinical neurotoxicity in approximately 10% of patients. However, emerging evidence from our group has
identified striking ethnic disparities in the incidence of neurotoxicity. Specifically, Latino patients with ALL appear
particularly vulnerable to dose-limiting clinical neurotoxicity, potentially compromising treatment efficacy and
contributing to well-established disparities in pediatric ALL relapse and survival. The overall goal of this project
is to reduce disparities among Latino children and adolescents by identifying host factors that predict an increase
in toxicity. Our preliminary studies provide evidence that mild to moderate acute neurological symptoms,
including pain, which occur frequently but are not routinely assessed in clinical settings, often precede the onset
of clinical methotrexate neurotoxicity. Our data further suggest that levels of cerebrospinal fluid metabolites,
jointly influenced by therapy and genetic variation, and neuroimaging biomarkers of altered white matter integrity
provide novel insights into mechanisms of methotrexate-related neurologic injury. Informed by our preliminary
data, the specific research aims of this project will examine: 1) to what extent do prospectively collected patient-
reported neurologic symptoms identify patients with preclinical toxicity prior to the development of clinically
evident neurotoxicity, 2) whether integrative approaches combining genomics with prospective profiling of central
nervous system metabolomic pathways can identify molecular predictors of neurotoxicity, and 3) the potential
utility of novel neuroimaging techniques to identify alterations in white matter integrity associated with future
neurotoxicity risk. This project builds on the rich resources available in the ethnically diverse, multi-institutional
Reducing Ethnic Disparities in Acute Leukemia (REDIAL) Consortium. Leveraging the REDIAL Cohort with
banked biological samples, this project with systematically evaluate and follow additional newly-diagnosed cases
of pediatric ALL. Therefore, this innovative proposal will establish one of the largest prospective investigations
of neurotoxicity in a multi-ethnic cohort of pediatric patients with ALL. The comprehensive research plan outlined
in this proposal will address key gaps in our understanding ethnic disparities in the incidence and etiology of
neurotoxicity. Ultimately, we anticipate that this line of research will inform risk-stratified approaches to safely
deliver curative chemotherapy to Latino children and adolescents treated for ALL to improve their overall survival."
10809714,"Atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of medium and large arteries and remains the leading
cause of death worldwide from its sequelae of heart attack, stroke and limb loss. During AS progression
chronic activation of immune cells in the vessel wall, especially macrophages, leads to formation of lipid-loaded
foam cells which become the major component of atherosclerotic plaque. The goal is to discover molecular
mechanisms through which dyslipidemia and oxidative stress, which are major risk factors for AS, are linked to
chronic macrophage activation via dysregulated function of fat cells (adipocytes). The proposal will explore
how adipocyte-derived exosomes (Ad-Exo) carrying specific pro-atherogenic cargo such as miRNAs, are
generated under oxidative stress, and how they activate macrophages. Focus is CD36, type II scavenger
receptor highly expressed in adipocytes and macrophages that acts as a receptor for the atherogenic ligand
oxidized LDL (oxLDL). The oxLDL/CD36 signaling axis creates an inflammatory paracrine loop between
macrophages and adipocytes and facilitates oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion through
Src family kinase (SFK) activation. Na/K-ATPase (NKA) α1 subunit serves both as a CD36 co- receptor and a
scaffold for the SFK, allowing conformational changes in the NKA to activate membrane bound SFK and
initiate signaling cascades, a mechanism distinct from its well-understood pumping function. Hypothesis of this
proposal is that activation of NKA/CD36 signaling in adipocytes produces oxidative stress that causes release
of adipokines and exosomes (Ad-Exo). These released factors initiate and augment AS by stimulating
macrophages. To test this hypothesis, 3 specific aims have been developed. The first will test the hypothesis
that adipocyte NKA/CD36 signaling complex promotes AS through production of cellular oxidative stress
leading to abnormal adipokines/exosome secretion. The approach will include use of the apoe null mouse
model and lentiviral vectors to deliver cell-specific NaKtide, a peptide reagent derived from the NKA α1 domain
that behaves as a specific inhibitor of the NKA/SFK pathway. Oxidant stress, AS plaque formation, and
adipocyte gene expression will be assessed using state-of-the-art techniques, such as next generation
RNASeq. The second aim will test whether Ad-Exo can modulate macrophage function in vitro and in vivo by
characterizing the proteome, lipidome and miRNA profile of Ad-Exo released in response to oxidative stress
and tracking their delivery to monocytes and AS plaque. A newly developed mouse model, GFP-
CD63flox/Adipoq Cre mice will be used as an excellent Ad-Exo reporter animal model for these studies. The
third aim will determine if Ad-Exo regulate macrophage lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function using
sophisticated metabolic flux assays along with lipidomic and gene expression assays. Successful completion
of this project will define an important concept that adipocyte CD36/NKA and downstream Ad-Exo secretion is
a driving force for chronic macrophage activation in AS, thereby identifying novel therapeutic targets."
10786127,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT:
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are disabling conditions that progressively
deprive affected individuals of their cognitive functions, ultimately leading to their inability to
perform basic activities of daily living. The brain depends on continuous and well-regulated
delivery of energy substrates through the brain blood flow, which is accomplished by elaborate
neurovascular control mechanisms that always ensure sufficient cerebral perfusion. One such
mechanism, termed functional hyperemia, couples local neural activity with the delivery of blood
flow and requires tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) for its full expression, since tPA enables
the production of the potent vasodilator nitric oxide during glutamatergic synaptic activity.
Neurovascular alterations are observed early in the disease course of ADRD and may promote
the expression of cognitive impairment. Amyloid-beta, a significant pathogenic contributor to AD,
suppresses functional hyperemia by upregulating the tPA inhibitor PAI-1 resulting in a reduction
in tPA activity. However, the cellular sources of PAI-1 remain unclear, and their identification
would suggest new approaches to rescue the neurovascular dysfunction induced by amyloid-
beta. Perivascular macrophages (PVM), brain resident myeloid cells distinct from microglia
located in the perivascular space, can produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
which are critical drivers of PAI-1 upregulation. Therefore, we will test the central hypothesis
that PVM are the major source of the PAI-1 that leads to tPA deficiency, neurovascular
dysfunction, and cognitive deficits induced by amyloid-beta. This hypothesis will be tested in 3
specific aims: (1) PVM are the source of PAI-1 mediating tPA deficiency and neurovascular
uncoupling induced by amyloid-beta, (2) PVM CD36 and Nox2, which are responsible for the
ROS production in these cells, mediate the PAI-1 upregulation, and (3) PVM PAI-1 contributes
to the effects of long-term accumulation of amyloid-beta. These specific aims will be
accomplished by employing tour de force approaches, including in vivo and in vitro techniques.
The application will widen our knowledge basis for the cellular mechanisms of harmful
neurovascular effects of amyloid-beta."

Osteochondral defects of the knee are common worldwide, yet there are few viable options for patients with
damaged osteochondral tissue as current treatments do not consistently regenerate functional tissue. The
standard of care for osteochondral defect repair is arthroscopic microfracture surgery, but this procedure often
results in formation of mechanically inferior fibrocartilage formation. To overcome limitations of this and other
surgical procedures, tissue engineering strategies, such as cell-laden biomaterial scaffolds, are promising
alternative approaches to treat these defects. However, scaffold-based strategies face several challenges, such
as interference with critical cell-cell interactions, potential immune and/or inflammatory reaction to the scaffold
and its degradation byproducts, and unsynchronized scaffold degradation rate with that of new tissue formation.
New cellular condensation strategies without a scaffold address these issues, however, it is still difficult to
precisely control the architecture of the engineered tissues to mimic the sophisticated three-dimensional (3D)
structure and organization of natural osteochondral tissues and their structure-derived functions. Recently, 3D
bioprinting has been applied in tissue engineering with the potential to create complicated, high-resolution 3D
structures. In addition, we have engineered the first technology capable of 3D printing a cell-only bioink and
maintaining the printed structure, which is necessary to form cell condensations. The hypothesis of this proposal
is that cellular condensation-based prevascularized osteochondral tissue constructs of precisely defined
geometries can be directly assembled with human stem cells and endothelial cells via 3D bioprinting into a
photocurable liquid-like solid, shear-thinning and rapid self-healing microgel slurry with spatially controlled
presentation of tissue specific growth factors. Microgel photocrosslinking after printing will provide temporary
mechanical stability for the printed constructs during culture to permit cellular condensation formation. This cell-
only bioprinting strategy will be implemented to print seamlessly continuous two-phase osteochondral tissue
constructs with a prevascularized bone phase and a cartilage phase. Specifically, this proposal aims to (1)
determine the role of microgel properties on the resolution and fidelity of the cell-only 3D printed constructs, (2)
engineer prevascularized osteochondral constructs with individual cell-only bioinks by spatiotemporally
controlled delivery of vasculogenic, osteogenic and chondrogenic growth factors, and (3) determine the clinical
potential of the 3D printed prevascularized osteochondral constructs by evaluation of new osteochondral tissue
formation and integration with the host vascular networks and bone and cartilage repair in a full-thickness
osteochondral rabbit defect model. This platform strategy has the potential to greatly enhance the lives of those
suffering from osteochondral defects and may enable the engineering of other complex functional tissues in the
body."

Dynamic lung tumor microenvironments (TMEs) contain a myriad of cell subtypes, each providing a unique
functionality in support of malignant growth. To prepare a metastatic niche, a tight signaling network must be
present to coordinate the delivery and sharing of co-stimulatory signals among malignant and non-malignant cell
populations. AXL and STAT3 cascades are critical components of intra- and intercellular signaling networks, as
they translate multiple external stimuli into specific cellular responses. Single cell profiling of lung tumors reveals
that AXL collaborates with STAT3 to generate a unified tumor ecosystem that promotes hybrid epithelial-to-
mesenchymal transition (EMT), pro-tumorigenic remodeling of fibroblasts and M2 polarization of macrophages.
Disruption of AXL-STAT3 network not only compromises this co-dependency in lung cancer cells implanted in
xenograft mice, but also limits the tumor cells' ability to conscript supportive host cells to form a symbiotic
community. We hypothesize that combined targeting of AXL-STAT3 network disrupts the communication
among diverse cell subtypes, thereby inhibiting lung tumor growth and metastatic spread. In Aim 1a, we will
conduct knockdown and knockout experiments in lung cancer, fibroblast and monocytic cell lines to explore the
relationship between AXL-STAT3 pathway and macrophage differentiation in co-culture systems. We will
demonstrate that AXL-STAT3 network in lung cancer cells and fibroblasts exerts a paracrine effect via IL-11
secretion on macrophages to sustain STAT3 signaling for M2 polarization and stemness mimicry. In Aim 1b, in
vivo drug testing of AXL and JAK inhibitors in CD34+ humanized NSGTM-SGM3 mouse xenograft models will
evaluate AXL-STAT3 drug targeting effects on host cell recruitment, hybrid EMT phenotypes, macrophage
plasticity and pro-tumorigenic remodeling of stromal fibroblasts. In Aim 2, we propose a phase Ib/II study to
determine safety and efficacy of dubermatinib (AXL inhibitor) and momelotinib (JAK inhibitor) in patients with
metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. In Aim 2a, a Bayesian Optimal Interval design will identify the MTD of
momelotinib in combination with dubermatinib with a target toxicity rate 30% in 18 patients. In Aim 2b, we will
conduct a prospective phase II, single-arm comparison of progression free survival in 26 patients treated with
combination dubermatinib and momelotinib versus an historical control. Correlative studies include pre- and post-
treatment paired lung tumor and liquid biopsies to determine if combined treatment can disrupt AXL-STAT3
signaling network in malignant and non-malignant cell populations and reprogram aggressive tumor
microenvironments. AXL-STAT3 targeting to restrain TMEs is a promising therapeutic strategy in patients with
advanced lung adenocarcinoma. This R01 proposal will address an important question regarding the efficacy of
combination treatment with AXL inhibitor and JAK inhibitor (for STAT3 signaling blockade) in lung cancer patients
and will provide a treatment stratification model based on intercellular crosstalk between AXL-STAT3 signaling
for an extended clinical trial."
10842322,"Project Summary
Tumor-stroma/immune cell signaling communications within the tumor microenvironment (TME) play important
roles in tumor development and responses to targeted and immunotherapies. However, our knowledge of
complex signaling communications within TME, and their roles in tumor development, drug and
immunotherapy response is limited. Effective molecular targets are still missing that can inhibit the tumor-
stroma signaling communications. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been being a powerful
technology to capture transcriptional changes in individual tumor, stroma, immune cells within TME. While
scRNA-seq datasets of human cancer are rapidly growing in number, which is leading to many basic and
translational discoveries, the study of dynamic tumor-stroma signaling communications is limited. Limiting
factors include: 1) static and single time-point snapshots of the complex interactions within the TME, and 2)
difficulty in perturbing a large number of related signaling targets; and measuring corresponding functional
effects to these perturbations in mouse or tumor tissues (to identify novel therapeutic targets and treatments).
To resolve these challenges, in this study, we propose to combine the cutting-edge technologies, including
novel artificial intelligence (AI) models, scRNA-seq, crispr-based single or double knockouts (CDKOs), 3D
tumor-CAF-TAM co-culture assays, and genetic mouse models, in a systems biology manner. Specifically, (in
Aim 1), we will develop novel network AI models using valuable large sets of scRNA-seq data of PDAC human
tumors at WashU to identify static core tumor-CAF-TAM interaction (TCTi) signaling networks (multi-cell intra-
/inter-cellular signaling networks of TCTi); and an initial set of anti-TCTi targets. In Aim 2, we will further
develop another network AI model (M-Step) to infer the better anti-TCTi targets using the functional validation
feedbacks in Aim 3; and predict synergistic drug combinations (inhibiting multiple key anti-TCTi targets). In Aim
3, the predicted targets and drugs will be efficiently evaluated using scalable 3D Tumor-CAF-TAM co-culture
assays and crispr-based knockouts (E-step) with 3 measurable metrics, i.e., tumor proliferation, migration,
angiogenesis. The M-step (modeling) and E-step (validation) forms an E-M process to identify key anti-
TCTi targets and drugs iteratively. We will apply these AI models in Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDAC) because 1) there have been very limited responses to immunotherapy; 2) no effective treatment; 3)
nearly all patients will develop chemo-resistant and metastatic tumors within 2 years of diagnosis. Also
(feasibility), 4) we have a strong cross-disciplinary team studying the PDAC TME (supported by NCI SPORE
and human tumor atlas network (HTAN)), with the valuable state-of-the-art resources. The success of this
study will identify novel anti-tumor-TAM-CAF targets and drug cocktails for PDAC treatment. The AI models,
supporting the novel E-M systems biology, can be applied to other cancers and diseases."

Despite effective therapies to control blood pressure and cholesterol, coronary artery disease (CAD) remains
the leading cause of death in the United States and the world. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
have identified >200 genetic loci significantly associated with CAD. The majority of these loci are not associated
with hypertension or hyperlipidemia, but contain genes expressed in vascular cells, suggesting the presence of
undiscovered CAD disease mechanisms operating through cells of the blood vessel wall. Identifying the biologic
mechanisms of these loci is difficult because most of the common variants associated with CAD are non-coding,
likely functioning through enhancers that can regulate multiple genes at great distances, and be highly cell-type
specific. This has slowed discovery, so that only a few such loci have been ‘solved’, preventing the realization of
the full potential of genetic studies for the development of much needed new classes of therapies for CAD.
What is needed are much higher-throughput, unbiased methods to systematically dissect these loci, to identify
molecular and cellular mechanisms of disease. To accomplish this goal, we have developed and validated two
novel high-throughput approaches with the ability to quantify the molecular and morphological effects of
thousands of genes in CAD loci: optimized Perturb-seq (to link genes to transcriptional phenotypes) and pooled
perturbation Cell Painting (to link genes to morphological effects).
We propose to use these technologies, together with new and novel computational approaches, to: 1) analyze
the transcriptomic effects of perturbing CAD-locus genes in vascular endothelial cells (ECs) subjected to four
stimuli associated with atherosclerosis, 2) quantify the morphological effects of perturbing all CAD-locus genes
in ECs, 3) integrate these data with epigenomic and genetic data to nominate causal genes and build hypotheses
connecting variants to genes, and genes to disease-associated cellular phenotypes, and then test the top 5 of
each of these hypotheses using variant-editing and EC-functional assays. This includes several prioritized causal
variant hypotheses that regulate EC shear stress response upstream of KLF2 expression.
The completion of these studies will accelerate understanding of the links between CAD genetics and disease,
and provide insights into EC functions in CAD that may inform the development of new classes of therapies.
More broadly, this study will establish new scalable experimental and computational methods to link noncoding
disease variants to genes and cellular phenotypes, which could dramatically accelerate variant-to-function
studies for cardiovascular and other common diseases."

 The incidence of HPV-associated (HPV+) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has
dramatically increased over the last few decades and continues to rise. Despite the magnitude of this epidemic,
mechanisms of HPV-driven carcinogenesis in HPV+ HNSCC have not been thoroughly investigated. Compared
to patients with tobacco-associated HNSCC, those with HPV+ HNSCC have increased overall survival and
higher response to treatment, which usually consists of chemo- and radiation therapy; however, survivors
frequently suffer from treatment’s toxic side effects, such as swallowing and speech dysfunction. In addition,
approximately 25% of HPV+ HNSCC patients develop recurrent or metastatic disease, for which there are limited
treatment options. A pressing goal in head and neck oncology is to decrease the morbidity of therapy for HPV+
HNSCC through treatment de-escalation. However, biomarkers that identify HPV+ patients with good prognosis,
who may be appropriate for de-escalation therapy, are lacking. Using three independent cohorts, we found that
constitutively active NF-κB (usually arising from genetic defects in NF-κB regulators, including TRAF3 and CYLD)
correlates with survival and should be explored as a prognostic biomarker in HPV+ HNSCC. Our preliminary
data suggest that survival benefits of patients, whose tumors harbor overactive NF-κB, are attributed to better
tumor response to therapy and that both, inherent NF-κB-driven tumor characteristics (e.g. downregulated
expression of oxidative stress response, NRF2 target genes), as well as a distinct tumor microenvironment (e.g.
elevated number of tumor infiltrating CD4+ T cells), may contribute to increased sensitivity of NF-κB active
tumors to radiation. We previously reported that mutations in TRAF3 and CYLD were associated with a lack of
HPV integration, leading us to hypothesize that NF-κB activation may enable cells to maintain HPV episomes.
Since the canonical HPV carcinogenesis model depends on HPV integration, we also hypothesize that activation
of NF-κB may be critical for an alternative mechanism of HPV carcinogenesis driven by HPV episomal
maintenance. To explore our hypothesis, in Specific Aim 1, we will investigate the impact of NF-κB signaling on
HPV gene expression and episomal maintenance. In Specific Aim 2, we will explore the significance of NF-κB
pathway on cellular proliferation, survival, and cellular transformation in response to HPV. Finally, Specific Aim
3 will explore mechanisms of NF-κB mediated radiation sensitivity in HPV+ HNSCC."
10805482,"The FoxA family of winged-helix DNA-binding transcription factors (TFs) play major roles in the
development of many organs in vertebrate embryos. In some cases, they are proposed to be
determinants of specific cell fates because they are expressed early and continuously in forming
organs, and they are capable of what has been referred to as “pioneer” function – the ability to
bind their target motifs even in closed chromatin, whereupon they can “open” that chromatin to
make it accessible to other key tissue-specific “settler” TFs. Combined, the pioneer and settler
TFs activate expression of the genes controlling tissue morphogenesis, specialization and
homeostasis through their sequence-specific interactions with the corresponding target gene
enhancers. As with the vertebrate FoxA TFs, the single FoxA orthologue in Drosophila, known
as Fork head (Fkh), plays major roles in the formation of multiple organs and in controlling the
survival, morphology and physiology of the salivary glands (SG). The relative simplicity of the
Drosophila embryonic SG, the non-redundancy in Fkh function, the short development time, ex
utero development, and the huge armamentarium of excellent genetic tools make this an ideal
model system for testing current models for vertebrate FoxA protein function, for uncovering the
mechanisms by which FoxA proteins coordinate morphogenesis with tissue-specific
physiological specialization, and for finding and characterizing the downstream effectors that
directly impact overall organ architecture and organ placement.
In Aim 1, we propose to learn how Fkh works with two other early-expressed SG TFs – Sage
and Senseless (Sens) – to regulate expression of the salivary gland “secretome”. Based on
earlier findings, these studies will challenge the notion that Fkh has the same pioneering
function that has been proposed for the vertebrate FoxA TFs. In Aim 2, we propose to discover
and characterize the partner SG TFs and downstream effectors that mediate the FoxA-driven
morphological events that transform the two-dimensional salivary gland primordia into three
dimensional internalized epithelial secretory organs. These studies will be among the first to
reveal how FoxA proteins partner up to drive the morphological changes that underlie tissue
development. In Aim 3, we characterize three Fkh morphogenetic targets that help coordinate
the abundance, localization and activities of two major players in tissue remodeling – non-
muscle Myosin II and the sub-apical transmembrane protein Crumbs. As new targets are
discovered (through the earlier aims), we will also determine where, when and how newly
discovered morphogenetic players contribute to overall tissue architecture."
10828899,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Adverse outcomes for pregnant patients and infants associated with the hospitalization for childbirth are
frequent and vary across hospitals in the United States. Organizational factors, such as organizational
structure and culture, in birth hospitals are potential drivers of variation in care and outcomes. Maternal and
neonatal levels of care, an organizational structure, are the risk-based services available at a hospital for
mothers and infants, respectively. Organizational culture refers to the beliefs, perceptions, and values on
obstetric and neonatal units in a hospital, a key component of which is the culture of patient-centered care. The
care and health of the mother and infant are interrelated, yet studies have not formally assessed perinatal
organizational factors, those created by the intersection of maternal and neonatal care at the hospital level.
 The overall objective of this study is to determine how organizational factors of obstetric and neonatal
units, formalized by this proposal as perinatal profiles of organizational structure and culture, impact perinatal
outcomes of mothers and infants and drive hospital variation. Dr. Handley will achieve this objective by 1)
assessing the impact of perinatal level of care profiles, 2) assessing the impact of perinatal patient-centered
care culture profiles, and 3) examining the interaction of perinatal structure and culture profiles on perinatal
outcomes. Her analysis will leverage a nine-state, retrospective cohort of mother-infant pairs as well as primary
data from her organizational culture survey of California birth hospitals, which will be linked with state data to
produce a novel dataset.
 This proposal was designed to prepare Dr. Handley to become an independent investigator, specifically
focused on integrating health services research and organizational science in order to understand how
organizational factors on obstetric and neonatal units affect perinatal outcomes. Her research will be
complemented by training in advanced statistical methods for observational data and primary organizational
culture survey data as well as acquiring in-depth knowledge of organizational behavior, dynamics, and change.
Working with a multidisciplinary team of mentors and advisors with experts from neonatology, health care
management, obstetrics, and biostatistics will provide her valuable guidance in the completion of this work and
planning of future studies.
 Understanding the implications of perinatal organizational structure and culture profiles on perinatal
outcomes is critical to improving perinatal care. Through better understanding of drivers of outcome variation
across hospitals and identification of organizational factors amenable to change, this work has the potential to
shape perinatal level of care policies, inform initiatives to improve organizational culture and coordination of
maternal and neonatal care, and guide future change at the hospital, state, and national levels, which are
actionable strategies to improve outcomes of the mother-infant dyad."
10881910,"Females are predisposed for developing systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but the underlying mechanisms
remain obscure. Females have two X-chromosomes and equilibration of X-linked gene dosage to that of males
(XY) occurs by X-Chromosome Inactivation (XCI), initiated and maintained by Xist RNA. The X-chromosome is
enriched for immunity-related genes and X-linked genes are typically overexpressed in female-biased SLE,
suggesting that impaired XCI maintenance contributes to SLE. Unlike other somatic cells, we found that naïve B
cells lack enrichment of Xist RNA and heterochromatic marks, and that these modifications return to the inactive
X (Xi) upon in vitro stimulation, which we term `dynamic XCI maintenance'. Our published work demonstrates
that SLE patient naïve B cells exhibit abnormal expression of X-linked genes, suggesting a dysfunctional Xist-
independent mechanism involving DNA methylation for transcriptional silencing prior to autoantigen stimulation
could predispose to lupus. DNA methylation, associated with transcriptional repression, is reduced in SLE patient
B cells and is an important epigenetic modification for gene silencing on the Xi. XCI is also regulated by various
nuclear matrix proteins, such as hnRNPU and SAFB, which bind to Xist RNA and function to anchor Xist to the
Xi or the nuclear lamina in somatic cells. Our preliminary data support the novel concept that Xist RNA transcripts
are retained at the nuclear lamina by SAFB in naïve B cells, and that Xist RNA binds to hnRNPU upon B cell
activation, tethering Xist RNA to the Xi to regulate transcriptional repression. We have developed a novel Xist
deletion mouse model to determine how impaired XCI maintenance contributes to lupus disease, and our exciting
preliminary data show that increased dsDNA levels in type I interferon induced disease. Our central hypothesis
is that Xist-independent DNA methylation maintains transcriptional repression of the Xi and autosomes in naïve
B cells and that upon activation, alterations in nuclear matrix protein binding promotes dynamic XCI
maintenance, the dysfunction of which exacerbates Type I IFN-driven lupus disease. We will test our hypotheses
with the following aims: (1) Are reductions in Xist-independent DNA hypermethylation in naïve B cells associated
with aberrant gene expression in lupus? (2) How do interactions between SAFB, hnRNPU protein and Xist RNA
maintain XCI in B cells and does lupus disease impair cohesin eviction by hnRNPU-Xist RNA complexes? (3)
How does impaired XCI maintenance impact Type I IFN-driven lupus-like disease in female mice? IMPACT: Our
novel and innovative genetic and molecular approaches will yield unprecedented mechanistic insight into how
biological sex contributes to immune dysregulation of SLE disease, and will enable the identification of new
molecular pathways and targets of female-biased autoimmune disease that could be amenable for therapeutic
intervention."

familiarity-evoked theta oscillations in the primary visual cortex (V1). In Fmr1 KO mice, a mouse
model of Fragile X syndrome, these oscillations are weaker, shorter, and frequency shifted.
Furthermore, we have shown a similar emergence of visually cued theta oscillations in the anterior
cingulate cortex (ACC), an area connected to V1 and involved in social interaction, decision
making and error detection. We have also started mapping the neural circuit underlying these
oscillations. Our prior studies suggest that these familiarity-evoked theta oscillations and the
underlying changes in the neural circuit connectivity may be the cause of impairments in visual
learning and perception. Our preliminary data also suggest that Fmr1 KO mice demonstrate
impaired theta oscillations in a visual discrimination task. We have developed a computational
model to reproduce theta oscillations in the cortex. This proposal builds on foundational advances
by dissecting the mechanisms of theta oscillations in WT and Fmr1 KO mice. Using an integrated
approach combining mapping of neuronal connectivity in brain slices, in vivo extracellular
recordings, and behavior, we will: 1) map the circuitry necessary to form a theta oscillator in V1
and identify altered connectivity patterns within V1 and between V1 and ACC in Fmr1 KO mice,
2) examine how the strength of theta oscillations in V1 and ACC correlates with behavior in WT
and Fmr1 KO mice following learning, and 3) rescue theta oscillations by restoring FMRP
expression selectively only in the specific neuronal groups in Fmr1 KO mice guided by the
computational model. Based on our prior studies, preliminary data, and computational model, we
expect to see familiarity-evoked theta oscillations correlate with successful behavior in a visual
discrimination task. We also expect to identify the critical parts of the neural circuit required for
the generation of theta oscillations and its impairment in Fmr1 KO mice. Results from this proposal
will help inform the development of targeted neural circuit-based behavioral and pharmacological
therapeutics to enable personalized medicine for individuals with ASDs."
10816596,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a genetically mediated, progressive, lung disorder. Evidence points
to dysfunctional epithelial telomeres as a core disease-initiating abnormality in IPF. There is limited knowledge
of the relationship between alveolar type 2 (AT2) cell telomere dysfunction and the cellular and molecular
elements of the remodeled fibrotic lung. Attempts to elucidate this connection in mouse models of telomere
dysfunction have been limited by the inherently long telomeres of mice and the use additional fibrogenic stimuli
such as low dose bleomycin, which may obscure the distinct input of dysfunctional telomeres to the pathobiology.
This proposal seeks to overcome these limitations by applying a novel model of progressive lung fibrosis driven
solely by telomere dysfunction isolated to AT2 cells (TRF1SC mice) to study mechanisms of lung fibrosis. The
hypothesis is that events developing in TRF1SC mice mimic early epithelial-specific events in the pathogenesis
of IPF and that this model will provide new insights into the origins of epithelial cell remodeling observed in IPF.
To test this hypothesis, the following aims will be explored: Aim 1 proposes to use TRF1SC/p53-/- mice to
establish whether p53 is a molecular mediator of progressive epithelial transdifferentiation and remodeling driven
by AT2 cell telomere dysfunction in TRF1SC mice. Single cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) will be used to define the
role of p53 on reprogramming of TRF1SC AT2 cells after telomere uncapping, and the appearance of other
profibrotic epithelial cell subtypes. Aim 2 proposes to study TRF1SC/TZAP-/- mice to test the hypothesis that the
latency of onset of fibrosis in TRF1SC mice requires telomere trimming. TRF1SC/TZAP-/- mice will be treated
with tamoxifen for 9 months and measures of telomere attrition, epithelial remodeling, and fibrosis compared to
control TRF1SC mice. scRNAseq will be used to define the contribution of telomere trimming to AT2 cell
reprogramming in control, TRF1SC, and TRF1SC/TZAP-/- mice. Telomere trimming in normal AT2 cells will be
investigated by studying changes in telomere lengths in aged TZAP-/- mice. Aim 3 proposes to culture IPF and
control AT2 cells in the presence and absence of hTERT overexpression in an organoid system to establish
whether augmenting telomere length restores epithelial cell fate and function of IPF lung epithelial cells.
Comparative endpoints include: telomere length measures, DNA damage detected by co-staining for γH2AX and
TRF2, senescence reprogramming by β-galactosidase and p16 staining. AT2 cell transdifferentiation into AT1
cells and by qPCR and immunostaining. The influence of hTERT overexpression on other IPF epithelial cell
subtypes will be studied by comparing gene expression by scRNAseq of mixed populations of IPF epithelial cells
cultured in the presence or absence of hTERT. If successful, these studies will provide an understanding into
cell-cell interactions, mediated by telomere dysfunction, driving lung fibrosis in IPF."
10812424,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Current care patterns for the 7 million patients visiting Emergency Departments (EDs) in the United States with
chest pain are heterogenous and not sustainable from a healthcare quality or economic perspective. Chest pain
is the second most common cause of ED visits and most common reason for short-stay hospitalizations. During
these hospitalizations patients undergo in-depth evaluations (stress testing, computed tomography coronary
angiography, or invasive angiography), but ultimately <10% are diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
These evaluations cost $3 billion annually and strain health system resources without clear evidence of improved
health outcomes or patient experience. Our preliminary data suggest that moderate risk patients (35% of patients
with chest pain) can be safely managed as outpatients using a cardiovascular ambulatory rapid evaluation
(CARE) strategy as an alternative to hospitalization. In the CARE strategy, patients are discharged from the ED
and receive outpatient clinic follow-up within 72 hours focused on medical management for cardiovascular risk
factors (e.g., hypertension, diabetes) and determining whether further cardiac testing is needed. This strategy
aims to enhance patient-centered outcomes while safely and equitably decreasing hospital resource utilization.
However, equipoise exists between outpatient and hospitalization strategies for moderate risk patients. There is
a paucity of prospective data evaluating the efficacy and patient-centeredness of outpatient chest pain evaluation
strategies in moderate risk patients. Thus, it is unclear whether use of an outpatient chest pain management
strategy (CARE) will safely reduce healthcare utilization and be preferred by patients compared to a traditional
hospitalization strategy. To address this key evidence gap, we propose the first prospective multisite randomized
trial testing outpatient vs hospitalization strategies in moderate risk patients. Our experienced research team will
randomize 502 patients 1:1 to the CARE or hospitalization management arms at three ED sites with a history of
high recruitment rates and productive collaborations in cardiovascular clinical trials. The primary outcome will be
hospital-free days (HFD) over a 30-day period. Patient-centered outcomes, such as patient satisfaction and
experience and out-of-pocket cost will be assessed at 30-days. Additional endpoints include HFD over 1-year,
30-day and 1-year cardiovascular HFD, rates of noninvasive and invasive cardiac testing, cardiovascular
rehospitalizations, and cardiovascular repeat ED visits. Patients will be monitored for safety: the composite of
cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and unplanned coronary revascularization at 30-days. This novel
trial addresses a key evidence gap by providing guidance on how best to evaluate moderate risk ED patients
with acute chest pain. Without this guidance care patterns are likely to remain heterogeneous, inefficient, non-
patient-centered, and unguided by the highest level of evidence. We hypothesize that data from this trial will
support widespread implementation of a CARE strategy, which could improve the quality and value of care for
millions of patients in the U.S. and beyond."

Motor circuits control fundamental behaviors such as swallowing, breathing and locomotion. Spinal motor
neurons are the key mediators translating motor commands generated within the central nervous system to
peripheral muscle targets. Motor neurons are activated by a precisely regulated pattern of synaptic activity from
sensory neurons, local spinal interneurons and descending pathways from the brain. During early development,
synaptic activity received by motor neurons shapes their functional properties. In contrast, gene mutations that
induce perturbations in either neuronal wiring or synaptic drive received by motor neurons often result in motor
system disorders. A prominent example of this situation is spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)—an inherited
neuromuscular disease caused by ubiquitous deficiency in the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. SMA
pathogenesis involves alterations of multiple components of the motor circuit leading to abnormalities in spinal
reflexes, motor neuron loss and skeletal muscle atrophy. However, the molecular, cellular and circuit
mechanisms underlying SMA remain largely elusive. Our previous work has led us in uncovering part of the
molecular mechanisms responsible for synaptic loss, implicating in part the classical complement cascade.
Imbalance of excitatory-inhibitory neurotransmission renders vulnerable motor neurons under tonic inhibition.
Importantly, SMA motor neurons die through cell-autonomous mechanisms implicating p53 pathway, Mdm2 &
Mdm4 as well as Stasimon, a downstream target of SMN. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms
responsible for postural and locomotor deficits in SMA mice are not known. Unraveling therefore the molecular
mechanisms responsible for these two phenotypes would provide key insights into the disease mechanisms. In
Aim 1, we will study whether dysfunction of dopaminergic synapses is responsible for the postural impairments
in SMA mice. To address this, we will employ mouse genetics together with morphological and functional assays.
In Aim 2, we will investigate the role of ventral spinocerebellar tract neurons causing gait and locomotor deficits
in SMA mice. We will also use mouse genetics, viral-mediated Cre expression, combined with morphological,
physiological and behavioral assays to complete this part of the project. In Aim 3, we will probe into the molecular
mechanisms that are responsible for synaptic loss involving CD47 and SIRPα as well as potential synergy with
C1q, the initiating protein in the classical complement pathway, under ubiquitous SMN deficiency in mouse
models of the disease."
10807096,"Project Summary/Abstract
While some individuals cope well with hardship, others are not as resilient. Although studies have focused on
the magnitude of fear reactions, clinical evidence suggests that response conflict is at the root of maladaptive
coping in psychiatric disease. The proposed research pursues the working hypothesis that norepinephrine
(NE), a neurotransmitter observed in high levels in patients suffering from fear and anxiety disorders, elicits
behavioral reactions that are in conflict with proactive coping behavior. Work in the field has focused on NE
release in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), which drives emotional learning in fear conditioning paradigms.
However, NE in the BLA does not affect the expression of fear (freezing reactions). Preliminary and published
data show that increased NE activity in the central amygdala (CeA), on the other hand, supports threat (fear)
reactions and opposes proactive behaviors. The amygdala receives strong input from the brainstem locus
coeruleus (LC), the major source of NE in the brain. The proposed research uses an active avoidance
paradigm (AA), in which animals learn to emit a proactive response to avoid a threat, to investigate how LC NE
release in the CeA controls the balance between freezing reactions and adaptive actions. To accomplish this,
an early life trauma paradigm will be used, which reliably yields animals that are unable to perform AA as
adults. We will manipulate the LCàCeA circuit in these so-called ‘poor avoiders’ and ‘good avoider’ controls to
identify the behavioral, electrophysiological, and molecular mechanisms underlying AA. We will test the
prediction that elevated NE release from LC, and the resulting changes at specific CeA target neurons, will
yield a poor avoider phenotype in good avoiders, whereas inhibiting this circuit in poor avoiders will ‘rescue’ AA
behavior. We will also assess the molecular identity and electrophysiological profiles of cell subtypes in the
CeA, how they are functionally different in good versus poor avoiders, and the role of LC activity in these
changes. Together, these studies aim to change how the field views the NE system, from modulating fear
memory formation in the BLA, to controlling defensive response selection via action in the CeA. These studies
will also challenge the dominant methodological paradigms (e.g., fear conditioning), which miss an essential
aspect of animal behavior: the competition between reactive versus proactive responses to perceived threats.
Successful completion of these studies will uncover the NE system’s role in adaptive coping behaviors and
provide evidence-based support for novel treatments of maladaptive coping, including active coping training
combined with drugs to control an overactive NE system."
10980500,"Exercise-Induced Shear Stress Modulates Metabolic Pathways for Vascular Repair and Protection
Cardiovascular and metabolic diseases are on the rise in our veterans returning from battlefields in
Afghanistan and the Middle East, and exercise intervention remains an effective lifestyle modification.
Hemodynamic stress forces modulate both metabolic and mechanical effects on vascular endothelial cells,
mediating the focal and eccentric nature of atherosclerotic lesions. The advent in metabolomics and metabolic
profiling has led to the discovery of new metabolic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We established that
bidirectional oscillatory flow impairs autophagic flux, perturbing mitochondrial homeostasis. In contrast,
unidirectional pulsatile flow attenuated mitochondrial DNA damage to maintain endothelial homeostasis. In
parallel, we developed flexible micro-electrochemical impedance sensors for detection of metabolically active
atherosclerotic lesions in the New Zealand White (NZW) rabbit model. We demonstrated that oxidized Low-
Density Lipoprotein (oxLDL) in atherosclerotic lesions display distinct frequency-dependent electrical and
dielectrical properties. Our preliminary studies revealed that pulsatile and oscillatory flow differentially
modulated metabolic pathways to promote vascular regeneration and athero-protection. We demonstrated that
flow-sensitive arterial metabolic changes were detected by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).
Furthermore, our metabolomics analyses revealed that PSS vs. OSS differentially activates PKCɛ-6-
phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) signaling to increase glycolytic metabolites,
but to decrease gluconeogenic metabolites, for vascular repair and regeneration. Metabolomics analyses
further uncovered flow-sensitive nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor 
(PPAR)-dependent fatty acid metabolites to mitigate monocyte recruitment. In this context, we hypothesize
that exercise-augmented pulsatile shear stress (PSS) modulates glycolytic and lipid metabolic
pathways to influence vascular regeneration and protection, leading to the arterial metabolic changes
that can be detected by 3-D EIS mapping. To test our hypothesis, we have three aims. In Aim 1, we will
determine if flow-mediated PKCε signaling modulates glycolytic metabolites for vascular regeneration. We
hypothesize that PSS and OSS differentially modulate PKCε-PFKFB3 signaling pathway to regulate production
of glycolytic metabolites. In Aim 2, we will determine if flow-sensitive PPAR signaling modulates lipid
metabolites for vascular protection. We hypothesize that PSS and OSS differentially modulate PPAR-SCD-1
signaling to regulate production of fatty acid metabolites. In Aim 3, we will demonstrate shear stress-PPAR-
mediated arterial metabolic changes by 3-D EIS mapping. We hypothesize that PPAR-SCD1-mediated
metabolic changes can be interrogated by 3-D EIS mapping. Overall, the integration of vascular biology,
hemodynamic forces and metabolomic profiling will provide metabolic insights into flow modulation of glycolytic
and lipid metabolisms to discover new biomarkers with therapeutic implications for our veterans at risk for heart
disease and metabolic syndromes."
10841400,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Understanding how to induce skin regeneration instead of scarring will have broad implications clinically and
cosmetically because; they inhibit mobility, are painful, and are a source of psychological trauma. In the United
States, treatment for burn victims alone amounts to $7.5 billion annually, the total market for scar treatment is
estimated to be around $12 billion. A lack of understanding of the role of fibroblast heterogeneity inhibits progress
in developing novel treatments for clinical conditions associated with scarring, such as, scleroderma, diabetic
ulcers, psoriasis and fibrotic keloid scarring. Consequently, understanding how to regenerate skin has the
potential to impact anyone who undergoes surgery, but also individuals with clinical conditions associated with
scarring. Adult skin wounds heal with scars, but embryonic skin can regenerate without scarring. However, not
knowing how to safely transfer the regeneration abilities of embryonic skin to adult skin remains a gap in
knowledge. Thus, the long term goal of our research is to establish methods to induce fibroblasts in adult skin to
have the same regenerative potential as their embryonic skin counterparts, without altering development and
homeostasis. The objective of this application is to induce adult fibroblasts with embryonic transcription factors
to reprogram skin to support regeneration and reverse aging. Embryonic and Neonatal skin have a transient
Papillary Fibroblasts (PFs) that are lost during skin maturation and aging. Neonatal PFs reside beneath the
epidermis, support skin regeneration, and express the canonical Wnt transcription factor, Lef1. A hallmark of
skin aging is the degradation of PFs and the loss of Lef1 expression. Our central hypothesis is that Lef1 is the
master regulator of Neonatal PF function, which induces scar-less skin regeneration and will restore PF identity
in aged skin. Guided by our exciting preliminary data we will use novel transgenic mouse models and next
generation sequencing technologies to investigate this hypothesis by the following specific aims: In aim 1 we will
test the hypothesis that Lef1 is the master regulator of Neonatal PF function by tissue specific induction in adult
skin. Here we will use wounding experiments and chamber grafting assays to test if adult scarring fibroblasts
can be transformed to be regenerative. In aim 2, we will define the downstream pathways that Lef1 regulates to
specify Neonatal PF functions. To do this we will perform ChIPSeq and Single-Cell-RNA-Seq with our
regenerative transgenic model systems. Finally, in aim 3 we will determine if Lef1 can safely restore Neonatal
PF identity and function in aged skin. We will analyze “old” transgenic mice with reprogrammed skin and test
their ability to regenerate skin and inhibit “aging”. This proposal is innovative because of our novel approach of
manipulating embryonic transcription factors in fibroblasts in vivo. The proposed research is significant because
understanding how to safely regulate fibroblast lineages will lead to new molecular and cellular targets to
regenerate organs, while also providing an important knowledge base for other clinical conditions associated
with dysfunctional fibroblasts such as; psoriasis, scleroderma, and arthritis."
10862854,"We have learned that most oxidative toxicity arises when oxygen species attack enzymic iron centers
and that cellular defenses work by blocking, reversing, or by-passing the resultant injuries. Yet key
observations remain unexplained. In Aim 1 we will investigate why superoxide stress precludes the use of
sulfate as a sulfur source, and we will examine why thioredoxins and glutaredoxins are strongly induced as
part of the cellular reaction to hydrogen peroxide. Extensive work has led us to the proposal that intracellular
cysteine and redoxins help to repair damaged metalloenzyme centers. This model would identify a key
connection between sulfur redox state and ROS.
 Two enzymes dedicated to anaerobic metabolism—pyruvate:formate lyase activating enzyme and
alcohol dehydrogenase—have been suggested to be inactivated by iron-centered oxidation events when cells
are aerated. This would comprise a clever exploitation of reaction types that are usually harmful. The goal of
Aim 2 is to test this striking idea. This hypothesis leads to notions of how the cell might seamlessly restore
anaerobic metabolism when anoxia is restored.
 Protein carbonylation (Aim 3) has long been used as a convenient marker of oxidative stress—but the
underlying events and physiological impact are unclear. Our data indicate that carbonylation is focused upon
relatively few proteins rather than the full proteome, and we suspect that these proteins are mononuclear Fe(II)
enzymes. Global mass spectrometry will identify them by name. We will also test the idea that methionine
sulfoxide is a disproportionate Fenton product that reductases can repair. The novelty is that methionine may
be oxidized by a secondary electron-hopping event, rather than by direct attack.
 Finally, in Aim 4 we will take a transcriptomic approach to fully define the OxyR peroxide response. We
hope to explain our discovery that OxyR activation per se compromises cells fitness, to the point of prohibiting
growth on acetate. It is not surprising that a stress response should exert a price, but we do not yet recognize
why any OxyR-driven adaptation would have such a profound effect.
 The emergent theme of oxidative stress is the tendency of oxygen species to react with iron centers,
and of cells to respond with layers of defensive tactics. Our four Aims will build upon this knowledge by
tackling persistent questions, with the overall goal of assembling a picture of oxidative stress that is detailed,
quantitative, and unified."

This is a proposal to renew a highly focused postdoctoral and predoctoral training program in Neurobehavioral
Genetics. Elucidating the genetic basis of diseases of the nervous system promises to transform our
understanding of some of the most prevalent, burdensome, and complex afflictions of humankind. The program
bridges several longstanding dichotomies; between nervous system mechanisms and behavior, between
neurology and psychiatry/psychology, between diseases and non-disease traits, and between humans and
model organisms. The program provides exposure to the science of neurobehavioral phenotyping to individuals
with basic or clinical science backgrounds And trainees, prior to their appointment, must commit to participate
for such a duration. To establish a balanced cohort and reflect the merge of the two training grants in
neurobehavioral genetics, which were previously funded separately by NIMH and NINDS, this program is
designed support 6 predoctoral trainees and 3 postdoctoral trainees each year. With the yearly appointments of
postdoctoral and predoctoral trainees and the two-year training of each participant, the overall group of trainees
in the program at any time is 12. The program stresses the importance of, and provides unified training in,
systematic delineation and assessment of nervous system phenotypes, including the integration of traditional
clinical and cognitive evaluations with recently available phenotyping tools such as neuroimaging and gene
expression profiling. The core curriculum of the program emphasizes phenotyping of the nervous system and
advanced genetics, and is designed to promote interactions between the postdoctoral fellows and their
predoctoral counterparts. A new curriculum element for this renewal is the support of a program faculty mentor
with statistical and computational expertise who provides program-wide support to trainees. Furthermore, we are
now aligning our training program with the highly successful UCLA Computational Genomics Summer Institute.
In this way, all our trainees will receive practical training by mathematical and computational scientists, receive
individual mentorship to advance their statistical and quantitative literacy, and obtain a thorough understanding
of rigorous scientific research of neurobehavioral genetics, which includes bioinformatics analysis of high-
throughput sequencing data and issues involved in large-scale data sharing. The program gains cohesion by a
neurogenetics seminar series and an annual program retreat. Intensive research experience with a mentor
chosen by the trainee constitutes the heart of the program. The ambitious goals of the program are achievable
because the program faculty is very strong in virtually all of the areas that are relevant to neurobehavioral
genetics, and because the faculty members have long embraced, in their research and teaching, the integrative
and cross-disciplinary approach that is at the heart of the program."

 Epigenetic dysregulation is frequently observed in pediatric cancers, including neuroblastoma (NB), the
most common extracranial solid tumor in pediatric patients. In my postdoctoral work, I identified that a cell state
transition from an adrenergic to a mesenchymal epigenetic state is associated with the loss of GD2 expression
and resistance to anti-GD2 therapy. Given the important role of anti-GD2 therapy in treating high-risk
neuroblastoma patients, I designed a CRISPR-Cas9 screening platform to study epigenetic regulators of GD2
expression. I identified that individual knockout of several members of the PRC1.1/BCOR complex increases
GD2 expression in GD2-low cell lines. AIM 1 will establish the relationship between the PRC1.1/BCOR complex
and GD2 regulation by rigorously testing the necessity of the PRC1.1 complex to maintain low ST8SIA1
expression in mesenchymal cell lines.
 Mining genetic dependencies across 25 tumor lineages, I identified that the PRC1.1 complex is an
enriched dependency in neuroblastoma independently of its ability to regulate GD2 expression. AIM 2 will
validate that the gene PCGF1, the top enriched PRC1.1 subunit dependency in neuroblastoma, is a genetic
dependency in multiple models of neuroblastoma. I will intersect chromatin and single-cell RNA-sequencing
studies to determine the consequences of PCGF1 knockout on chromatin regulation and differentiation/cell state
trajectories.
 No known small molecule inhibitors of PRC1.1 currently exist. The correlation of USP7 genetic
dependency in the Dependency Map portal against all other gene dependencies revealed a strong correlation
with PCGF1 dependency, suggesting a tractable pharmacologic approach to inhibiting PRC1.1. AIM 3 will
establish USP7 inhibition as a mechanism to modulate PRC1.1 activity. These specific aims will test the capacity
of highly potent and selective USP7 inhibitor to selectively upregulate GD2 expression and reduce
neuroblastoma viability in vitro and in vivo.
 I anticipate that these findings will directly link PRC1.1 to epigenetic state and differentiation in
neuroblastoma. Moreover, it will credential USP7 inhibition as a combinatorial therapy to restore the response
to anti-GD2 therapy and directly target neuroblastoma cells. To complete the studies in this proposal, I will apply
my strong expertise in epigenetics and pharmacology. To fill in critical gaps in knowledge and expand my
scientific training, I’ve assembled a training plan that includes advisory committee members that are experts in
immuno-oncology, single-cell sequencing, and USP7 chemistry. This proposal lays a strong framework for my
long-term goal of establishing a lab that focuses on targeting epigenetic plasticity/heterogeneity as an
intervention to overcome therapeutic resistance."

Alcohol misuse has a salient precipitous effect on intimate partner violence (IPV), which is a persistent public
health crisis affecting approximately one-third of the U.S. population. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is
highly prevalent, has a clear causal effect on alcohol misuse, and it is a robust independent predictor of IPV.
However, few studies have examined the combined effects of PTSD and alcohol misuse on IPV. This question
is critical to address because effective prevention and treatment approaches for alcohol-related IPV are scant.
Integrating these two siloed areas of the literature can help inform the development of novel, trauma-informed
modalities for couples to produce stronger and more sustainable outcomes. Dr. Flanagan is the ideal candidate
to advance the clinical science in this area. Under the proposed mid-career development award, she will
accelerate her thriving patient-oriented alcohol research program by enhancing her skills with 1) oral alcohol
administration, 2) intensive ambulatory assessment, and 3) psychophysiology. She will achieve these goals
through expert consultation, didactic training, and implementation of the proposed research project. Her team
will examine the combined effects of alcohol misuse and PTSD on alcohol-related IPV among couples (N=70) in
both a controlled laboratory setting and in naturalistic settings. The study, which was designed to complement
mentees’ independent research interests, will also compare outcomes across settings and explore heart rate
variability as a physiological mechanism underlying the hypothesized relations. The invaluable protected time
and resources provided by this K24 will enable Dr. Flanagan to achieve her primary goal of expanding her
mentoring availability and skillset at this pivotal mid-career stage. She will engage a program of didactics and
expert coaching to amplify her investment in diversity, equity, and inclusion in mentoring, leadership, and
science. Achieving these synergistic objectives will accelerate the science of couple and family alcohol research
and set the stage for innovative new dyadic treatments. This award will also ensure that Dr. Flanagan is equipped
to support the next generation of enthusiastic new investigators and to ensure the longevity of this vital yet
underrepresented area of the alcohol field."

Respiratory tract infections cause a considerable burden to health care systems and societies as a whole, which has been exasperated by COVID-19. Available preventative treatments for respiratory infections and the common cold have remained unsatisfactory and are often not adhered to. Psychological factors, such as stress, increase risk for respiratory infections and the common cold. A possible mechanism for this relationship could be reduced levels of nitric oxide (NO), which serve as a first-line defense mechanism. NO is reduced during periods of psychological stress, such as academic finals in students. Boosting levels of NO during periods of stress may provide a prevention strategy for respiratory infections, especially in populations with high transmission risk. Our pilot data suggests that beetroot juice elevates the fraction of exhaled NO (FENO) and attenuates cold symptoms during stressful final exams. The current study proposes a three-arm, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled trial design (conditions: one daily active dose and one daily placebo dose, two daily active doses, two daily placebo doses, with 50 participants in each condition, total N=150), with students under final examination stress, to examine the usefulness of beetroot juice in elevating airway NO measured by FENO and thereby reducing respiratory viral infections tested by viral polymerase chain reaction. The current study will 1) demonstrate that a 7-day trial of daily beetroot juice or de-nitrated placebo beetroot juice is feasible logistically and with acceptable adherence during a period of real-life stress, 2) generate initial evidence for the capacity of beetroot juice to increase elevations in FENO, which correlates with reductions in infection using respiratory viral panel, (biological signature), 3) examine dosage effects, in that two daily active doses of beetroot juice are likely more potent than one daily dose or placebo in elevating FENO. The trial will use a well-controlled paradigm of a naturalistic stress to demonstrate that airway NO production is the critical target mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of dietary nitrate supplementation on respiratory tract infection and common cold symptoms. Two university sites will recruit participants and their findings and experience in team integration will prepare a regular-size two-arm, double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial of beetroot juice effects on respiratory infection, which will include additional recruitment sites across the Southwestern US."

Astrocytes are crucial regulators of brain development and function. Astrocytes acquire a remarkably complex morphology
that allows them to associate with each other, other cell types (e.g. the vasculature) and synapses where they regulate
synaptogenesis, neurotransmitter reuptake, metabolic support, ion balance, and ultimately animal behavior. While it is
believed that the elaborate morphology of astrocytes is absolutely essential for efficient astrocyte function, how astrocytes
acquire this unusually complex architecture remains poorly defined. This is surprising in light of their crucial roles in neural
circuit formation and function, and the fact that disruption of astrocyte growth control results in the most intractable and
deadly human brain tumor, glioblastoma.
 How do astrocytes acquire their remarkably morphology, and how do they organize their subcellular architecture
to enable their diverse functions? We will attempt to answer these central questions using Drosophila astrocytes as a model.
Fly astrocytes are remarkably similar to their mammalian counterparts by morphological, developmental, molecular, and
functional criteria, and Drosophila offers a battery of powerful molecular-genetic tools with which to explore fundamental
questions in astrocyte biology that are not available in other organisms. We will begin by comprehensively characterizing
the cell-wide organellar landscape of astrocytes by examining the distribution of ~30 genetically encodable markers that
label cellular organelles (Aim 1). This will allow us to define, with single-cell precision, the basic organellar architecture
of astrocytes. This will be an essential first step toward understanding how their intricate morphology is arranged
ultrastructurally and how it may dictate, or be regulate by, their functions. These cellular landmarks will also enable a
rigorous analysis of mutants that affect astrocyte morphology. In Aim 2, we will perform the first unbiased forward genetic
screen for astrocyte growth control pathways. We have established a unique genetic screening platform for this purpose in
Drosophila based on MARCM technology, which allows for rapid screening with single-cell resolution for mutants that
alter a variety of phenotypes including cell morphology (growth, tiling, association with synapses), changes in proliferation,
or other changes in astrocyte properties. In preliminary work we have optimized our screening system, along with imaging
methods to maximally facilitate our work. This is part of a long term effort to understand how astrocytes are built in vivo.
Defining how astrocytes control their cell growth, infiltration, and tiling will be critical for us to gain a better understanding
how astrocytes affect brain health and disease. Since this will be the first forward genetic screen for astrocyte growth control
pathways, a wealth of exciting mutants await discovery. We will focus our subsequent efforts on pathways conserved in
mammalian astrocytes, and given the strong conservation of the developmental and functional properties in flies and
mammals, we expect our work will identify a number of new high-priority pathways for understanding astrocyte
morphogenesis in mammals."

PROJECT SUMMARY
Knowledge of biological networks has been critical to the analysis of big biomedical datasets, including
interpretation of the molecular heterogeneity seen within and across tumors. NDEx, the Network Data Exchange
(ndexbio.org), is an online commons where scientists find, share, and publicly distribute biological networks.
With a previous grant from the Informatics Technology for Cancer Research program (ITCR U24 CA184427),
we created the NDEx open-source database platform along with its public website and query system. Further,
we enabled interoperability with the Python and R data science platforms and built NDEx seamlessly into the
Cytoscape network analysis and visualization ecosystem. NDEx presently serves a large base of users and
network content, with approximately 3285 accounts linked to >180,000 networks, of which approximately 6500
are publicly accessible. NDEx is the approved network repository for articles published in the Springer Nature
and Public Library of Science (PLoS) families of journals.
We are requesting sustained ITCR funding for the NDEx project to maintain, scale, and enhance the NDEx
system, meeting the evolving needs of the biomedical research community via the following five Specific Aims:
1. Maintain and scale NDEx and its services to support a large and growing community of users. Regular
 software releases of NDEx will continue to extend its capabilities. Targeted server hardware upgrades will
 increase capacity and performance to match the growing use of NDEx.
2. Extend the NDEx corpus of cancer pathway networks. We will continue to maintain and extend the NDEx
 Cancer Collection (NCC) corpus of networks via outreach, collaborations, and automated text and image
 analysis methods to capture cancer networks from literature.
3. Enable the use of networks in next-generation cancer genome analysis. We will enhance the use of networks
 in existing 'omics analysis tools used by the cancer research community and develop and maintain analysis
 tools that leverage NDEx functionality and data.
4. Enable publishing of interactive networks. Building on our success in enabling publications to link to NDEx
 networks, we will add new capabilities for authors and readers to enhance the dissemination of interactive

10834266,"SCA3, also known as Machado–Joseph disease, is the most common dominantly inherited ataxia in the world.
The mutant SCA3 disease protein, ATXN3, acts through a dominant toxic mechanism, and mice lacking ATXN3
are phenotypically normal. Thus, suppression of the disease gene, ATXN3, represents a promising approach to
slow or block the neurodegenerative cascade in SCA3. Anti-sense oligonucleotides (ASOs) represent a nonviral
gene suppression approach that has emerged as a compelling therapeutic strategy for treating SCA3 and other
neurodegenerative disorders. However, this approach suffers from three main limitations: i) highly invasive
(intrathecal or intracerebroventricular) route of administration; ii) poor deep brain penetration, and iii) lack of cell-
specific targeting. The goal of this proposal is to address each of these limitations using bispecific antibodies
conjugated to ASOs (bAb-ASOs) to enable: i) intravenous administration; ii) efficient transport across the intact
blood-brain barrier (BBB) and deep and widespread brain penetration; and iii) selective targeting of neurons
using antibodies that target cell-surface proteins that mediate neuron-specific internalization and intracellular
release of ASOs. Our approach has three main components. First, we use a validated IgG (M6) specific for a
neuronal membrane protein (Neuronal Glycoprotein M6a) that is highly conserved within mammals and highly
expressed in the brain. Second, we genetically fuse a single-chain antibody to the C-terminus of the IgG M6 that
recognizes an understudied BBB target for mediating efficient transport into the brain parenchyma, namely
CD98hc. Third, we attach ASOs to the M6/CD98hc bispecific antibody that will be released after antibody
internalization and mediate gene silencing. The overall objective of the current proposal is to establish the
feasibility of using bAb-ASOs to silence disease-specific neuronal genes in transgenic mice and suppress
disease phenotypes. Our central hypothesis is that the bispecific antibody will enable delivery of ASO across the
BBB and into neurons, resulting in cell-specific gene silencing and improvement in disease severity. To test this
hypothesis, we will first evaluate PK/PD of bAb-ASO conjugates and silencing of ATXN3 (Aim 1). We will
conjugate our validated M6/CD98hc bispecific antibodies to an optimized ATXN3 ASO and test in cell culture.
For in vivo analysis, we will use the YAC SCA3 transgenic mouse line, which harbors the full human SCA3
disease gene and recapitulates molecular and behavioral features of SCA3. We will perform PK/PD analysis to
evaluate the silencing of ATXN3 protein and the duration of this effect with repeated dosing. Next, we will
evaluate the efficacy of silencing ATXN3 using bAb-ASOs in mouse models of SCA3 (Aim 2). We will directly
compare the efficacy of peripherally delivered bAb-ASO conjugate to that of intracerebroventricular injection of
the naked ASO in aging SCA3 mice to determine whether peripherally delivered bAb-ASO conjugate prevents
the development of disease-associated phenotypes and, if so, whether the efficacy equals or surpasses that of
naked ASOs."

Vocal fold scarring results in voice dysfunction and decreased quality of life for patients. With
around 20 million people impacted by voice disorders each year, and vocal fold scar a common
cause of this dysphonia with few effective treatments available, new, novel treatment
approaches are needed. Currently, one of the primary challenges to treatment is wound healing
optimization in the dynamic, delicate vocal fold multi-layer structure. Although surgical repair
can be employed for vocal fold scar treatment, current surgical techniques often result in
subsequent scarring. Adjuvant local therapeutic delivery, most commonly with corticosteroids, is
often used to improve wound healing; however, limited access to the vocal folds generally
restricts providers to a single therapeutic injection at the time of surgery. In-office procedures
exist for subsequent therapeutic vocal fold injections, though these are uncomfortable for
patients and increase treatment costs. Oral corticosteroids are not an effective alternative, as
research has found them less effective than local application and with more side effects.
Additional novel biologics have been proposed for vocal fold scar treatment, though these are
also limited by similar delivery problems to corticosteroids. We have found that a novel,
injectable encapsulated implant can deliver corticosteroids over time either in a sustained
release fashion or in a laser-light activated approach effectively for up to eight months in a
leporine eye preclinical model. In prior work, we found minimal immune response or
unanticipated drug leakage from the injectable implant in the leporine eye. In parallel, we have
optimized vocal fold biomechanical quantification matched to histology after vocal fold injuries.
In the first aim, we will optimize our injectable implant for the vocal folds and measure any local
immune response in healthy leporine vocal folds. In the second aim, we will employ the implant
in a vocal fold injury model to quantify its healing impacts compared to no treatment or
traditional single corticosteroid injections. This work lays the foundation for optimized, dose
controllable therapeutic delivery to the vocal folds and improved drug delivery."

The goal of Einstein/Montefiore Paul Calabresi Career Development Award for Clinical Oncology and Equity
Research is to train the next generation of oncology scholars, with a special emphasis on conducting clinical and
translational research in the underserved and diverse Bronx catchment area. This will be achieved through a
coordinated program of mentoring, a comprehensive formal curriculum, and research projects with an
interdisciplinary, collaborative design with focus on community outreach and engagement. The program, its
leadership and participants are integrated within the established research programs of the NCI-designated
Montefiore Einstein Cancer Center (AECC). The Calabresi Program will select highly qualified clinical and
translational investigators from all oncology disciplines, from a diverse group of primarily MDs, but also PhDs,
who are committed to careers in patient-oriented clinical and translational research with a focus on diverse
populations. The duration of the training is 2 to 3 years and funding for 4 scholars is requested. The research
focus is being expanded beyond cancer therapeutics to include cancer care delivery relevant to the Bronx
population, which is 70% URM’s. A formal curriculum has been developed in conjunction with Einstein’s Institute
for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR) featuring an MS degree in Clinical Research Methods and
includes two mandatory Calabresi-centered courses, one on “Clinical Trial Development in the Era of
Personalized Cancer Medicine and Immunotherapy”, and another on “Comparative Effectiveness Therapeutic
Research”. Additional courses and workshops are offered in Biostatistics and Grant writing. The Principal
Investigators are Dr. Amit Verma, M.D., Director of the Division of Hemato-Oncology, and Dr. Yvonne Saenger,
MD, Director of the Immunotherapy program and Coleader of Experimental Therapeutics. Both PIs bring
complementary expertise in both liquid and solid tumors and also a track-recordin basic/translational and clinical
research, as well as in mentoring junior clinical investigators. An Executive Committee of senior faculty leaders
provide oversight in the selection and ongoing evaluation of the progress of the Scholars and the impact of the
program. An Internal Advisory Board (IAB) chaired by cancer center director, Dr. Edward Chu, and an External
Advisory Board with K12 PIs will provide guidance and direction to the Calabresi program. Novel initiatives are
planned to increase the recruitment of URM candidates. Strong institutional support from the Medical College,
Cancer Center and Montefiorehas resultedin salary support of numerous scholars. Since inception, the Program
has enrolled 24 Scholars (3 URMs): with 22 remaining committed to academic careers in leadership positions in
oncology. A successful track record of high impact publications, especially in fields of minority outcomes in
diverse populations of the Bronx is evidence of uniqueness of the proposed training program. Our proposed K12
training grant will train the next generation of oncology clinical researchers on unique challenges of conducting
successful clinical trials in underserved minority populations, using the Bronx as a model ecosystem."
10868668,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Osteoporosis can be defined as the progressive loss of bone mass and strength with age, leading to increased
risk of fragility fracture. Osteoporotic fracture and fracture-related traits, such as bone mineral density (BMD),
are highly heritable and Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for BMD have identified over 1100
associations for the phenotype of BMD. Further, there are many mono-allelic conditions, such as osteogenesis
imperfecta, that lead to low BMD and low-trauma fractures in children. Bone is in a constant state of
remodeling, with formation mediated by the osteoblast and resorption by the osteoclast and when these
processes remain balanced, there is no net change in BMD. Imbalances in remodeling results in the loss of
bone seen in osteoporosis, but a GWAS done for BMD cannot determine which of these physiological
processes are affected by each locus. All current fracture prevention therapies focus on tipping the remodeling
balance away from bone loss. There are three bone anabolic therapies approved by the FDA, but each of
these has black box warnings, each can only be used for a limited time (1 to 2 years respectively) and none of
them can be used in children. We have shown in previous work that bone mineralization by the osteoblast is a
highly heritable, complex genetic trait and that genetic mapping for the absolute amount of mineralization
possible yields information that is complementary to that identified by GWAS for BMD. However, the osteoblast
is a highly regulated, complex cell that undergoes an as of yet incompletely described differentiation process,
must be able to migrate to the site of bone remodeling, must be able to produce the proteinaceous extracellular
matrix of bone and then must be able to execute mineralization. The goal of this application is to identify the
key genes and pathways that control these aspects of osteoblastogensis and osteoblast function. In Aim 1, we
will map high-resolution quantitative trait loci (QTL) for osteoblast maturation, migration and rate of mineral
apposition. In Aim 2, we will use cutting edge Bayesian network analyses based on single cell RNA seq and
single cell ATAC seq to define master control genes of various stages of osteoblast development. In Aim 3 we
conduct functional follow up on genes found via our preliminary analyses that control the late stages of
osteoblast function. We expect that this comprehensive and complementary approach to identify key genes for
osteoblastic processes will provide critical insight into how bone is formed by the osteoblast. More importantly,
the genes that we identify will serve as potential therapeutic targets capable of increasing bone formation in the
setting of osteoporosis and in other formation disorders."

challenge in nutrition research. In response to the RFA-DK-20-005, we propose to create a Dietary Biomarkers
Development Centers (DBDCs) at Harvard University. Our long-term goal is to establish a rigorous and highly
productive resource, available to the NIH, USDA, and external investigators, to systematically catalog validated
metabolomic signatures of intakes of foods/food groups defined by the USDA. Our Specific Aims are:
Aim 1. Establish an Administrative Core that will provide scientific leadership, administrative oversight, and
seamless coordination of the efforts of the participating Cores and Projects within and across DBDCs;
Aim 2. Establish an Intervention Core that will perform controlled pharmacokinetic (PK) and dose-response
feeding studies of: 1) chicken, beef, and soybeans; and 2) whole wheat bread, potatoes, and oats. The food
selection is based on their contributions to protein and carbohydrate intakes in the U.S. diets, their potential
health effects, and the promise of finding valid markers. Nonetheless, we are also receptive to testing different
foods or food groups in coordination with other DBDCs and the Steering Committee;
Aim 3. Establish a Metabolomics Core that will 1) use an integrated metabolomics platform of five
complementary high resolution and accurate LC-MS methods that together comprehensively profile food-
derived compounds with diverse chemical and physical properties in plasma and urine; 2) elucidate structures
of yet unidentified LC-MS metabolite peaks associated with food intake;
Aim 4. Establish a Data Analysis Core that will: 1) provide dedicated statistical support and expertise for all
Cores and the Biomarkers Project within the Center; and 2) manage and maintain large datasets and ensure
timely analytic tool/software sharing with other DBDCs and data submission to the Data Coordinating Center;
Aim 5. Conduct a Biomarkers Project by integrating Core resources to 1) characterize pharmacokinetics and
establish calibration curves of novel food biomarkers using data from the controlled feeding studies; 2)
evaluate the identified biomarkers’ performance in an already completed 6-week controlled feeding trial of
three healthy dietary patterns (OmniHeart); and 3) validate the identified dietary intake biomarkers in two
observational cohorts with repeated measures of diet, nutrient biomarkers, metabolome, and gut microbiome.
The proposed DBDC at Harvard is carefully structured and highly integrated, taking a systemic and innovative
approach to dietary biomarker discovery and validation. Our metabolomics platform has contributed data to
NIH consortia, including Integrative Human Microbiome Project (iHMP), Molecular Transducers of Physical
Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC), and Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program. By leveraging
multiple areas of expertise and the exceptional resources, we will contribute to the accelerated discovery of
food biomarkers, with the ultimate goal of advancing precision nutrition research to improve human health."
10843131,"ABSTRACT
Chronic orofacial pain is estimated to be experienced by up to 25% of the adult population, which greatly
decreases quality of life. A common complaint of orofacial pain is from mechanical stimuli. Current treatments
for various orofacial pain conditions are limited. Physicians recommend dietary interventions for management of
disorders such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, but less is known about how diet may alleviate pain. It
is possible that diet may also contribute to chronic orofacial pain conditions, as omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty
acids (PUFAs) such as linoleic acid (LA) and arachidonic acid (AA), are essential PUFAs that are regulated by
dietary intake and known to be pronociceptive. Our data demonstrate that mice fed an 8-week high omega-6
diet (H6D) exhibit increased plasma membrane levels of LA and AA in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and increased
hindpaw sensitivity to mechanical stimuli. LA, AA, and their metabolites could be regulating nociception through
activation of channels in primary afferent nociceptors. More specifically, LA and AA are cleaved from membranes
by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) isozymes where they can be oxidized into biologically active metabolites, which
can activate targets like transient receptor potential channels expressed on primary afferent nociceptors.
Therefore, the release of omega-6 PUFAs from cellular membranes may play a key role in regulating nociceptor
activities and pain. However, it is unknown whether a H6D is a pain risk factor in orofacial tissues innerved by
trigeminal ganglia (TG) afferent neurons. Given the distinct molecular expression differences between TG and
DRG neurons, studies on the role of H6D as a risk factor for orofacial pain must be conducted in the TG system.
Our preliminary data demonstrates that mice fed a H6D for 8-weeks exhibit significantly increased orofacial
responsiveness to mechanical stimuli filaments. There is a large gap in knowledge as to the mechanisms by
which dietary intake of omega-6 lipids serves as a risk factor for orofacial pain. Based on recent studies and
our preliminary data, we propose to test the central hypothesis that increased dietary omega-6 PUFAs
sensitize trigeminal sensory neurons and increase nociceptive behaviors in preclinical models of
inflammatory and neuropathic orofacial pain via neuronal phospholipase A2. To investigate the role of diet
on orofacial pain, we will 1) examine the role of H6D in sensitization of sensory neurons, 2) determine if H6D is
a pronociceptive risk factor in models of orofacial pain conditions, and 3) identify PLA2 isozymes mediated H6D-
induced effects on mechanical nociceptive behaviors. The scientific significance is based on an innovative
hypothesis and may lead to novel therapeutic interventions for orofacial pain conditions. Although dietary
recommendations are made for many diseases, they represent a new approach for managing orofacial pain.
These dietary interventions may offer considerable clinical translational applications with relatively low cost and
adverse effects. Equally important, techniques and research experiences comprise an outstanding training
vehicle for my future career as an academic clinician-scientist."

The absence of prophylactic and low-cost influenza vaccines along with slow production rate
makes us unprepared for the next pandemic outbreak worldwide. Recombinant virus-like particles
(VLPs) vaccines provide us with unique opportunities to address these difficulties, but their
recombinant synthesis strategies are limited to cell culture production, which has its challenges
such as limited throughput and architectural heterogeneity of the obtained products. In this project,
we aim to combine wheat germ cell-free protein expression platform with active microsomes of
different origins (including human) to synthesize glycosylated influenza virus-like particles (VLPs).
These particles will further undergo detailed morphological and compositional examination using
electron microscopy and native mass spectrometry to understand the architecture of obtained
products and understand the mechanisms of their assembly and composition variability. High-
resolution tomography will be utilized to determine the best VLP candidates with maximal antigen
occupancy and thus maximal vaccine efficiency. We hypothesize that this approach will be
suitable for a stable and streamlined generation of Influenza VLPs and will offer much more
flexibility and control over their architectural heterogeneity and eventually serve as a rapid
prototyping platform for influenza vaccine development. The current project will also inform us
about the utility of using such approaches for virology and for glycoprotein synthesis in general."
10844392,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a condition in which normal brain function is impaired by an external force. TBI is
estimated to affect ~69 million people worldwide each year. Mild TBI’s are the most common form of brain injury
(~70-90% of all cases), characterized by little-to-no time unconscious and minimal observable deficits
immediately post-injury. Mild brain injuries are commonly attributed to participation in contact sports (e.g. boxing,
football, soccer, hockey), military service, and as a result of intimate partner violence. Even mild TBI, especially
following repeated injuries, has devastating acute and long-term consequences, including an increased risk of
stroke and dementia. Given the clear evidence that TBI increases the risk of dementia in later life, it is of great
interest to determine the mechanisms that drive the relationship between different types of TBIs and various
dementia-associated neuropathologies, so that targets for intervention may be identified. Repetitive mild TBI has
been most notably associated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (a tauopathy), though some evidence
suggests it may also contribute to Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative conditions. However, less is known
about whether cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) may also be a mechanism linking TBI to dementia. CAA is
the accumulation of amyloid protein (most commonly beta-amyloid, associated with Alzheimer's disease) within
the cerebral vasculature, contributing to increased risk of dementia [both vascular contributions to cognitive
impairment and dementia (VCID) and Alzheimer's disease], as well as ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.
Increased levels of CAA are observed in former athletes, who tend to have a history of repetitive mild brain
injuries. Experimental designs using animal models are needed to determine whether and how repetitive mild
TBI influences the initiation and progression of CAA and related pathology. Here, we will subject Tg-SwDI mice
(a transgenic mouse model of CAA) to repetitive mild TBI (1x/day for 5 consecutive days) starting at ~2 months
of age. This age is roughly equivalent to late adolescence/young adulthood, when TBI is most common, and is
prior to the onset of significant CAA pathology and cognitive impairment in this strain. We will then determine
whether cognitive-behavioral deficits and neuropathology are altered at two time-points post-TBI (short-term: 7
days and longer-term: 3 months). Additionally, we will investigate whether biological sex moderates the
relationship between repetitive mild TBI and CAA-associated outcomes. Our long-term goal is to identify
mechanisms linking TBI and increased dementia risk, which may in turn reveal novel targets for treatment."

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a highly aggressive disease typically diagnosed at locally advanced or
metastatic stage, with dismal prognosis associated with high rates of treatment resistance and disease
recurrence. Clinical management of NSCLC varies according to the stage. High-dose stereotactic body radiation
therapy (SBRT) is the standard of care for localized non-resectable NSCLC. However, as discovered more than
six decades ago, tumor hypoxia is a significant barrier to effective radiation therapy. In the last decade, first line
NSCLC treatment has been substantially reinforced with the introduction of immunotherapy targeting immune
checkpoints such as programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), yet long-term disease control occurs in less than 25% of
NSCLC patients. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of the treatment resistance is essential to address
the dire need of introducing novel synergistic therapies to elicit enhanced treatment response in hypoxic NSCLC
tumors. Tumor hypoxia has been associated with anti-cancer treatment resistance for decades, yet its role in
clinical management of NSCLC remains largely unexplored. The basis of tumor hypoxia has traditionally been
attributed to the oxygen supply deficit as malformed tumor vasculature fails to meet the high demand of the
rapidly proliferating tumor mass. However, our preliminary analysis of NSCLC patient datasets in the Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) PanCancer dataset revealed a significant correlation between high-level expression of
nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial subunits essential for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and high-
level expression of hypoxia-regulated genes (Buffa hypoxia score). Furthermore, we have observed a direct
positive correlation between high frequency of copy number amplification (CNA) of several essential OXPHOS
genes, and hypoxia levels in NSCLC patient samples. Because mitochondrial function consumes up to 90% of
available cellular oxygen, its activity may be indirectly regulating oxygen availability in the tumor
microenvironment by rapidly consuming oxygen upon its delivery to the tumor. Mechanistically, this leads to the
hypothesis that OXPHOS gene amplification drives mitochondrial function which may, in turn, promote tumor
hypoxia and treatment resistance in NSCLC. The proposed R03 validation study therefore aims to identify the
role of high frequency of OXPHOS gene CNA in driving tumor hypoxia and treatment resistance of NSCLC
tumors. Upon completion, this study will contribute to current understanding of mechanisms of refractory disease
in NSCLC patients and may provide novel markers of treatment outcome."

The immune system at mucosal sites must be tightly regulated to mediate rapid immunity to invading
pathogens, while limiting over-reactive responses that drive chronic inflammation. In particular, type 2 immune
responses in the airway or gastrointestinal tract are essential to protect from helminth parasites, but if
dysregulated, drive asthma and allergic inflammation. Despite this knowledge, we do not yet fully appreciate
the complexity of cellular and molecular signals that control these responses, which will be critical for
developing the next generation of preventative, therapeutic or curative treatments. The fundamental focus of
this renewal application for the Mucosal Immunology Studies Team is to define novel pathways by which the
type 2 immune response harnesses signals associated with the nervous system to regulate rapid mucosal
immunity and inflammation. In this context, we will define: (i) the pathways that induce and regulate these
neuronal signals, (ii) the functional significance of these pathways in type 2 mucosal immunity and
inflammation, and (iii) whether it is possible to therapeutically target these signals to boost immunity to
helminth infection or reduced chronic allergic inflammation. We will employ innovative approaches and develop
new tools to address these fundamental gaps in knowledge, and where possible, translate our findings from
mice into human samples. Results from these studies will significantly advance our understanding of the
pathways that are essential to mediate rapid type 2 immunity and inflammation at mucosal sites and
could provoke the next generation of preventative, therapeutic and curative treatment strategies."

CD8 T cell mediated immunity is instrumental in the clearance of numerous viruses and protection from
secondary infections. With the advent of cancer vaccines and a better appreciation for the central role of cell
mediated immunity, T cell responses are at the forefront of modern vaccinology. Synthetic Long Peptide (SLP)
vaccination has proved effective in cervical cancer trials and we have shown that SLPs can be used to focus T
cell responses in infectious disease. Despite their advantages and preclinical efficacy, SLPs must be formulated
with sometimes toxic and expensive experimental adjuvants to induce immune responses. Furthermore, the
immunogenicity of SLPs is hampered by the relatively poor delivery of soluble peptides to dendritic cells (DCs)
and the suboptimal processing of SLPs by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) into short peptides that are
then presented to CD8 T cells. Here, we propose to test an SLP-based vaccine composed of nanoparticles
loaded with epitope specific SLPs modified with a proteolysis targeting molecule (ProTM) that recruits E3 ubiquitin
ligase, thus optimizing SLP degradation via the UPS and subsequent presentation of SLP epitopes to T cells.
We plan to synthesize, optimize, and test an SLP vaccine that utilizes biodegradable nanoparticles loaded with
either a T cell-activating adjuvant or SLPs modified with an endosomal escaped domain (EED) and ProTM. We
anticipate that our vaccine will elicit robust T cell responses by targeting both adjuvants and modified SLPs to
DCs. Once internalized, SLP's will be released from the biodegradable particles, gain access to the cytosol, and
be trafficked to the UPS for degradation, thus enhancing peptide presentation via MHCI to CD8 T cells. Our
proposal describes a vaccine platform that can be easily tailored to treat malignancies or prophylactically to
generate protective T cell responses against infectious disease. It is the first vaccine platform that utilizes
ProTMs to enhance antigen presentation to T cells."

Mental health inequities among Black adults in the United States are stark. In 2020, the prevalence of past-year
any mental illness based on a DSM diagnosis was 17% among Black adults (over 7 million people). In
perspective, that number is more than the combined populations of Chicago IL, Houston TX, and Philadelphia
PA. Black adults tend to be diagnosed with mental health conditions that are more severe, persist longer, and
have debilitating social consequences. Socio-structural and environmental stressors such as racial
discrimination, police brutality, and persistent poverty are well-documented predictors of poor mental health
among Black people. Social connectedness is directly associated with improved mental health and buffers the
negative impact of several health risk factors such as social isolation. Yet, research on social connectedness
and mental health among Black adults remains limited. This paucity of work reflects a critical gap in knowledge
regarding a psychosocial protective factor that may be salient to reducing poor mental health outcomes among
Black adults. To address this gap, we will use quantitative data from Black adults residing in Milwaukee, WI who
participated in the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study (n=1489 combined across waves) and collect
qualitative data from Black adults to contextualize the quantitative findings and develop potential intervention
strategies. Specifically, we will develop and assess the measurement properties of a multidimensional social
connectedness indicator constructed from existing items assessed in MIDUS (e.g., social integration,
religious/church-based social support, and social cohesion) (AIM 1a). Then we will test the associations between
neighborhood- and individual-level social connectedness with three mental health outcomes (e.g., Kessler-6
psychological distress, MASQ general distress-depressive symptoms, and DSM-III-R major depression) (AIM
1b). To better understand how social connectedness influences mental health, we will estimate the degree to
which social isolation and loneliness mediate the association between social connectedness and mental health
(AIM 2a) and quantify the extent to which social connectedness buffers associations between racial
discrimination and mental health outcomes (AIM 2b). Lastly, in partnership with community stakeholders, we will
conduct focus groups to contextualize the quantitative findings and use the first two steps of 6SQuID model to
develop potential intervention strategies and targets to address persistent mental health inequities among Black
adults (AIM 3). Impact: Investigating the mechanisms undergirding the associations between multidimensional
social connectedness and mental health is an important step toward advancing health equity. This study findings
will provide a strong evidence-base to inform community-based interventions to modify and leverage social
connectedness among Black people as part of a larger strategy to reduce racial health inequities. The findings
will stimulate longer term research to generate more evidence for a “social in all policies” framework to illuminate
how underlying mechanisms and processes of social relationships affect health, illness, recovery, and well-being."

Background: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) continues to have high mortality rates despite a plethora of
available treatments. Variable prognosis, treatment response and survival are largely based on cytogenetic and
molecular aberrations that characterize AML subtypes. Fast and cost-effective methods of detecting AML fusions
and mutations could improve clinical outcomes for patients, as standard next generation sequencing (NGS)
methods are limited by several technical and bioinformatic issues.
Hypothesis: We have developed a CRISPR-based single molecule long-read sequencing assay (CSRL) to
quickly detect clinically relevant mutated genes in AML. This new methodology, combined with new bioinformatic
approaches, allows for same day results of sequencing data. We hypothesize that such technology can be
improved to detect both mutation and translocations common in AML, and that this rapid turn-around-time will
positively impact patient care by allowing swift risk stratification and treatment selection.
Proposal: In this study, we expand the CSRL assay to include more relevant mutations and translocations.
Specifically, we will ask and answer 1) Will the CSRL assay identify all the mutations and fusion in the target
genes seen by NGS and cytogenetics? 2) Do the single molecule reads provide a more accurate assessment of
tumor burden? 3) Do CSRL data allow for determination of phasing of mutations and provide additional
prognostic or predictive significance? 4) Is same-day sample collection and result reporting clinically feasible for
the AML CSRL assay and how will obtaining same-day CSRL results impact clinical decision making? 5) What
improvements can be expected upon the current turnaround time, costs, and assay performance in comparison
to standard NGS? To answer questions 4 and 5, we will conduct a pilot clinical trial to test feasibility of clinical
implementation. Research Design/Specific Aims: Specific aims: SA1) To expand our CSRL sequencing
assay and optimize current bioinformatics workflow to allow for same-day diagnosis (~8 hours). This
development will use a multiplexed CRISPR enrichment library of long nucleic acid molecules on a low cost
Nanopore device. SA2) Validate sensitivity and specificity of the assay developed in SA1 and evaluate
prognostic impact of phasing data provided by long reads and single molecule quantification for more
accurate tumor burden assessment. We will test the proposed method on a set of clinically annotated leukemia
samples with existing molecular data obtained with standard NGS and cytogenetics. SA3) To establish clinical
utility of CSRL sequencing with same-day leukemia molecular diagnosis. The purpose of this specific aim
is to demonstrate the clinical impact of our same day ultrarapid molecular profiling assay through a pilot study
on 10-12 patients at our cancer center. We will test real world feasibility of implementing these methods on
samples from the clinic, ease of same day testing and reporting, and study the impact same day results could
potentially have on how oncologists treat their acute leukemia patients."

 SLC13A5 epilepsy is a newly recognized form of Developmental Epileptic Encephalopathy 25 (DEE25)
with seizures beginning within the first days of life along with subsequent intellectual and motor symptoms. In
these patients, mutations in the SLC13A5 gene, which encodes a plasma membrane citrate transporter, result
in a severe, early onset multi-focal epilepsy and cognitive and behavioral symptoms. How disruption of SLC13A5
function results in dysfunction of neural circuitry is unknown. In patients and in rodent loss of function models of
SLC13A5, plasma citrate concentrations are elevated and cytoplasmic citrate is decreased. Since citrate is a
precursor to neurotransmitters, diminished glial and neuronal citrate may result in abnormal neuro-transmitter
metabolism, contributing to functional defects. However, SLC13A5 loss of function may not account for the full
severity of the disorder, and truncations of SLC13A5 are rarely observed in patients. Instead, human genetics
show that certain mutations are over-represented as known causative mutations; SLC13A5 G219R (DNA
G655A) and T227M (DNA C680T) are the most common recurrent mutations found in approximately two-thirds
of all known patients. While the epilepsy is associated with bi-alleleic mutations, the presence of recurrent
missense mutations suggests mechanisms more complex than simple autosomal recessive genetics. However,
these have not been fully investigated, and no specific treatments for these patients exist.
 In order to better understand the genetics of SLC13A5 epilepsy, we have developed novel experimental
systems. In fly, the entire Drosophila Slc13A5 gene was replaced with the human SLC13A5 coding region. This
results in expression of only the human SLC13A5 expressed in the central nervous system. In the humanized
line, the G219R mutation causes lethality in contrast to the null, suggesting gain of function mechanisms. In
rodents, we show that the equivalent mutation to G219R in mouse SLC13A5 causes more severe epilepsy in
direct comparison to the null, again suggesting the over-arching hypothesis of this proposal: that pathogenic
mutations in SLC13A5 have gain of function effects, as well as, loss of function effects. However, the
understanding of the mechanisms underlying these effects is incomplete, and the determination of both genetic
and functional mechanisms are highly important for developing treatments for SLC13A5 epilepsy. We will
determine in three Aims to determine:1) what is the normal function of SLC13A5 in brain physiology 2) how do
pathogenic mutations in SLC13A5 result in neural dysfunction 3) if novel therapeutic strategies may ameliorate
symptoms in SLC13A5 syndrome."

specialized care settings. In contrast, PCMHI services are brief and time-limited (≤6, 30-minute sessions) to be
consistent with primary care services that treat a high volume of patients. To extend the reach of treatment to
primary care Veterans who present with a pain concern, we have developed a PCMHI-based version titled
Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Chronic Pain (Brief CBT-CP). Brief CBT-CP condenses content into
only six sessions organized around the 30-minute appointment structure used by PCMHI providers. Brief CBT-
CP was recently evaluated in a clinical demonstration project that found a statistically and clinically significant
decrease in a composite measure of pain intensity and pain-related activity interreference following treatment.
On average, the majority of improvement was achieved in the first three sessions of treatment signaling that
Brief CBT-CP can potentially produce rapid clinical benefit. Our funded RR&D SPiRE (in progress) indicates
the high feasibility of our trial methods as we frequently exceeded planned monthly recruitment goals with high
retention. Additionally, patients have reported high levels of treatment satisfaction and PCMHI providers report
that Brief CBT-CP is an important and feasible intervention. Based on these preliminary studies, this
application proposes to conduct a single-blind, double-arm, randomized controlled trial among [178] Veterans
with chronic musculoskeletal pain and pain-related functional impairment who receive primary care services at
the VA Western New York Healthcare System. Veterans will be randomized to either (1) Brief CBT-CP and
primary care treatment as usual (TAU) or (2) TAU only. Patient data will be collected at baseline, mid-treatment
(6-week), post-treatment (12-week), and follow-up (6-month) to evaluate through multilevel modeling if Brief
CBT-CP produces a rapid decrease in pain-related activity interference (primary outcome). Secondary clinical
outcomes (pain intensity, depression symptoms, suicidal ideation, quality of life, and social role engagement)
will be assessed in the same manner. The second goal of the study is to assess potential treatment mediators
(i.e., pain self-efficacy and catastrophizing) and moderators (i.e., demographic factors, treatment expectations,
opioid and adjunctive treatment use, therapeutic alliance) to determine if these factors impact outcomes. The
third aim of the study incorporates a mixed methods component by including qualitative interviews with patients
to illuminate how Brief CBT-CP contributes to improvement in functional status and improved life role
engagement. This study is well-aligned with the mission of RR&D and supports the VA clinical goals nationally
by promoting a safe, accessible, non-pharmacological treatment for chronic pain early in the trajectory of care."
10664838,"Hoarding Disorder (HD) is a chronic, progressive, and debilitating psychiatric condition that leads to
devastating personal and public health consequences. HD is defined by persistent difficulty discarding or
parting with possessions due to distress associated with discarding, urges to save, and/or difficulty making
decisions about what to keep and what to discard. Subsequent accumulation of clutter can become so
dangerous that it puts individuals at risk of falls, fires, infestations, food contamination, medication
mismanagement, social isolation, nutritional deprivation, and eviction. Medical problems, activities of daily
living (ADL) impairment, decreased quality of life, and functional disability are associated with HD symptom
severity. HD starts early in life, does not remit if left untreated, and increases in severity with age. The highest
rates of HD are seen in older adults, with up to 25% experiencing HD symptoms. The population of older
Veterans is substantial, with 41% expected to be over the age of 65 by 2030. Recent research has found that
Veterans with HD experience more medical and psychiatric comorbidities; thus, Veterans represent a group
with high needs for effective HD treatment to reduce disability and improve multiple aspects of functioning.
 Dr. Ayers’ group has developed and evaluated Cognitive Rehabilitation and Exposure/Sorting Therapy
(CREST) in randomized controlled trials. The CREST intervention provides compensatory cognitive strategies
to address the executive dysfunction typical of individuals with HD, and then uses exposure therapy to reduce
the distress associated with discarding items. CREST improves HD symptoms and functioning in Veterans with
HD, but the intensive nature of the program (6-8 months) burdens mental health clinics and slows progress.
Given that the home is the primary site of clutter and the need for sorting of a large volume of items during
treatment, a home-based treament approach is needed. To reduce the burdens and barriers to implementation
of CREST, we will use a novel approach, referred to as Personalized-CREST, designed to reflect a precision
medicine approach to evidence-based treatment for HD. Personalized-CREST will be more individualized
(matching cognitive strategies to Veteran needs and priorities), more efficient (shorter timeframe over 12
weeks), and easier to access (in-home sessions and home-based video telemedicine [HBVT] sessions).
Recent pilot data suggest that HBVT for HD is feasible, efficacious, requires minimal adaptation, and is a
preferred. Based on 73 non-Veteran community Personalized-CREST completers, results indicated statistically
significant decreases in functional impairment, disability, and of HD symptom severity.
 The proposed randomized controlled trial will compare Personalized-CREST to a case management
(CM) control condition for 130 adult Veterans with HD. Personalized-CREST will be delivered twice a week in
the home (one face-to-face and one HBVT session) for 60 minutes per session. A total of 24 sessions will be
provided over 3 months. Per the standard of care for CM, a social worker will visit the Veteran once a week in
their home. A thorough evaluation of treatment outcomes, including multifaceted functional and rehabilitative
outcomes, including quality of life and hoarding severity will be conducted at baseline (0 months), mid-
treatment, end of treatment (3 months), and 6-month follow-up. We will also examine factors that mediate
improvement in Personalized-CREST (improved executive functioning and reduction in avoidance of
discarding items). Individual factors (e.g., age, baseline executive functioning, baseline HD severity, gender
and economic factors) and treatment factors (e.g., attendance) will be explored as moderators. The proposed
study will generate knowledge to advance the rehabilitative care of Veterans with HD."
10881735,"The morbidity and mortality of malignant melanoma are significant problems for veterans, their families,
and the general public. Progress has been made in early diagnosis and in treatment, in particular with advances
in checkpoint inhibition therapy. However, not all patients respond to this approach and the treatment has major
toxicity. There is a continuing unmet need for improvement in treatment of melanoma. This project presents a
novel and potentially breakthrough treatment approach, based on the impact of the enzyme N-
acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase, also known as arylsulfatase B (ARSB). This enzyme removes sulfate groups
from chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4S) and dermatan sulfate and is required for the degradation of these sulfated
glycosaminoglycans. Our previous work has shown that lower ARSB activity is associated with more aggressive
melanomas. Also, decline in ARSB leads to increased expression of the melanoma proteoglycan chondroitin
sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG)4 and of the matrix metalloproteinase pro-MMP2 which facilitates invasion. Other
experiments have shown increase in PD-L1 expression in melanoma cells following ARSB silencing.
 In this project, we will determine the transcriptional mechanism by which decline in ARSB increases
expression of PD-L1 in normal melanocytes and melanoma cells. Experiments will show how decline and
increase in ARSB affect melanoma cell survival and intracellular signaling. The impact of anti-PD1 treatment on
melanoma cell survival will be tested in live cell co-culture with immune cells following ARSB silencing. Other
studies in the B16F10 and YUMM mouse models of melanoma and in a humanized mouse xenograft model will
show the impact of modulation of ARSB in association with checkpoint inhibitor treatment on the progression of
primary and metastatic melanomas. This project is based on over 30 publications in which Dr. Tobacman and
collaborators have identified biological consequences of decline in ARSB. A previous report with project
collaborator, Arkadiusz Dudek, M.D., Ph.D., a distinguished oncologist and investigator with strong interest,
background, and clinical experience in immuno-oncology, identified decline in ARSB with increasing
aggressiveness of melanoma cell lines, as well as significant increases in expression CSPG4 and pro-MMP2.
 Inborn deficiency of ARSB is present in the lysosomal storage disease Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) VI,
in which mutations lead to marked reduction of ARSB activity. In malignant cells from prostate, breast, colon,
and liver, as well as in melanoma cells and tissue, we have shown that expression and activity of ARSB are
reduced, compared to normal melanocytes and tissue. Decline in ARSB leads to accumulation of the sulfated
glycosaminoglycans chondroitin 4-sulfate and dermatan sulfate, from which ARSB normally removes the 4-
sulfate group at the non-reducing end and is required to initiate their degradation. With decline in ARSB, C4S
accumulates and its interactions with critical molecules are disrupted. We have shown that galectin-3, a co-
transcriptional activator which binds to other important molecules, including the insulin receptor, binds less to
more highly sulfated C4S and has increased nuclear translocation and interaction with transcription factors.
Inversely, SHP2 (PTPN11), the ubiquitous non-membrane Src homology region 2 (SH2)-containing protein
tyrosine phosphatase 2, binds more with more highly sulfated C4S and is less available for dephosphorylation
of critical signaling molecules, including phospho-ERK1/2. Hence, the transcriptional events arising from altered
sulfation of C4S have profound impact on vital cellular processes.
 This project will provide new insight into how changes in ARSB, and the resulting changes in chondroitin
4-sulfation and signaling and transcriptional events, impact on melanoma progression and on response to
checkpoint inhibition. The findings may lead to new approaches to treatment of melanoma and to improvement
in response to checkpoint inhibition, resulting in reduced suffering, morbidity, and mortality from melanoma."
10884904,"ABSTRACT
Emotional well-being, which includes life satisfaction, life purpose, and positive emotions, is a key public health
target. Although health can influence well-being, only recently has there been increasing attention on how
overall well-being can influence health outcomes. Critical knowledge gaps exist in both understanding the
research on the role of emotional well-being in health and in measuring well-being outcomes, which constrain
valid and rigorous evaluation of intervention strategies. The interdependence of health and well-being within
and among family members has not been well-characterized: the health and well-being of a patient affects
family members, but the well-being of family members--especially informal caregivers or parents--can also
directly affect the well-being of the patient. Moreover, these interrelated effects vary across the lifespan, from
child well-being within a family to elder well-being among family members and relatives.
The specific aims of this U24 research network proposal focus on developing a coordinated set of
collaborative, transdisciplinary mechanisms designed to create, launch, and sustain a new generation of well-
being researchers and innovative research activities across the lifespan, with a special emphasis on measuring
family well-being and child quality of life: (1) improve access to and use of emotional well-being measures by
creating a web-based resource repository of curated instruments, research findings, datasets, and
training/learning materials; (2) stimulate well-being research through funded pilot projects that address the
measurement of well-being across the lifespan with dedicated funding for pediatric quality of life projects; (3)
assemble a research scholars corps with multidisciplinary training and expertise that will support and foster a
pipeline of scholars for future research on measurement. This set of activities will serve to coalesce this
emerging field, building research capacity to support better evaluation of interventions and improving public
health through the measurement of measurement of well-being at the population level."
10867349,"Project Summary/Abstract
Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem worldwide, and half of patients presenting with HF have
preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), rather than reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). However, HFpEF remains
a therapeutic challenge, given current limited understanding of causal and contributing factors. Functional iron
deficiency (FID, defined as a ferritin level < 100 ng/ml or transferrin saturation (Tsat) < 20% with ferritin < 300
ng/ml) is present in approximately half of all patients with either HFpEF or HFrEF. In patients with HFrEF, FID
is associated with reduced exercise capacity, poorer quality of life, and increased mortality regardless of
hemoglobin level. Correction of FID consistently and durably improves exercise capacity in HFrEF, however
less is known about the functional impact of FID in patients with HFpEF or in the general population. Beyond
its role in erythropoiesis, iron is an obligate component of myoglobin and enzymes involved in cellular
respiration, oxidative phosphorylation, vascular homeostasis, nitric oxide generation, and the citric acid cycle,
which all can be negatively impacted by iron deficiency. Hepcidin, a hormone synthesized by the liver, is
considered the master regulator of iron homeostasis. Hepcidin reduces iron bioavailability and levels are
regulated by inflammatory signaling pathways (eg, IL-6, IL-1β) and by the protein hemojuvelin which plays a
critical role in iron sensing. We have previously demonstrated that lower hepcidin levels are cardioprotective in
animal model studies and that elevated hepcidin levels in symptomatic HFrEF patients precluded normalization
of FID with oral iron supplementation in the NIH-sponsored multi-center IRONOUT-HF Trial. In our preliminary
studies of HFpEF patients undergoing comprehensive cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) FID with
reduced Tsat/hepcidin ratio was associated with exercise cardiac output, peripheral O2 extraction, pulmonary
vascular resistance and peak VO2, implicating FID as an important determinant of multiple aspects of exercise
capacity. We now propose to measure iron status, hepcidin and hemojuvelin levels in a large community-
based cohort (Framingham Heart Study Gen3/OMNI2, N=3,116) and in a referral cohort with suspected
HFpEF (MGH ExS, N=450) to understand the role of FID in relation to functional capacity, leveraging existing
CPET measures of low-level, intermediate and peak exercise O2 utilization in both cohorts. Our overarching
hypothesis is that FID arises in the setting of pro-inflammatory states that precede overt HFpEF, which is
characterized by impaired ability to augment O2 utilization, as reflected by reduced peak VO2. In Aim 1A, we
will determine the prevalence, risk factors, genetic determinants, and functional significance of functional iron
deficiency (FID) in the community. In Aim 1B, we will determine how FID relates to organ-specific dysfunction
indicative of HFpEF subphenotypes in the MGH Exercise Study. In Aim 2, we will prospectively investigate how
treatment of FID in a randomized trial of iron repletion in 66 HFpEF patients improves exercise capacity and
influences distinct mechanisms of exercise intolerance."

 Project Period: 2021-2026
Project Summary/Abstract
The request in this proposal allows the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) to
continue the development of a sustainable Produce Safety Program within California. This will be
accomplished by enhancing the current program to conduct the necessary farm inspections; provide
education, outreach, and technical assistance to growers; and develop a farm inventory database.
CDFA chose to respond using Path B and will complete all applicable program objectives:
 • Goal 1: Conduct ongoing program assessments and planning while maintaining foundational
 resources that are essential to sustainable implementation of the PSP.
 • Goal 2: Routinely provide education, outreach, and technical assistance opportunities.
 • Goal 3: Establish a robust farm inventory within a database management system to maintain a
 complete and accurate database of California produce farms.
 • Goal 4: Create an integrated inspectional approach that represents and enables a proactive
 (partnership) approach to foodborne outbreaks and focusing on education of growers.
 • Goal 5: Implement the compliance and enforcement program with emphasis on consistency.
 • Goal 6: Strengthen CDFA’s event response planning infrastructure to build upon existing
 systems for detecting, investigating, analyzing, and mitigating foodborne illness outbreaks.
To achieve these goals, CDFA will continually assess and strategically plan to increase the capacity of
the existing regulatory program; perform ongoing expansion and quality control of the produce farm
inventory; provide opportunities for education and training using evidence-based, nationally consistent
training and workshops; and utilize a systems approach to maintain and further develop a
comprehensive compliance and enforcement program focused on quality and national consistency.
Expected Outcomes: Continued development of the PSP will reduce public health risks for
consumers of California produce across the nation. Utilizing a systems approach including both
education and enforcement to promote understanding of and compliance with the PSR, CDFA will
encourage the safe growing/harvesting/packing/holding of fruits and vegetables, significantly advance a
national integrated food safety system, and effectively fulfill the requirements of FSMA."

This proposal aims to improve the care of specific populations included in the special emphasis notice (NOT-
HS-21-014) to advance health equity by increasing health services research involving transgender and gender
diverse youth, youth who identify as Black, Indigenous, or People of Color (BIPOC), and youth living in rural
communities. Gender diverse youth (GDY) who identify BIPOC, as well as those living in rural communities,
are more likely to experience depression and anxiety than their peers.1-5 Additionally, BIPOC and rural GDY
are disproportionately underrepresented in pediatric gender clinics,6-8 limiting their access to pediatric gender-
affirming care, which has been shown to improve mental health outcomes.9,10 One proposed solution for
improving access to gender-affirming care, which is currently provided in large academic medical centers, is
facilitating its delivery in the community setting. Prior research suggests both GDY and community pediatric
providers are interested in community-based care delivery models, especially those that incorporate
technology-based support from gender specialists;11,12 however, additional stakeholder-engaged research is
needed to ensure interventions meet the needs of GDY and their families. Given few providers have received
training in this area13-15 and most lack opportunities to consult with transgender specialists, telehealth
modalities like telemedicine and electronic consultation show great potential in facilitating the provision of
community-based gender-affirming care. Unfortunately, little is known about whether existing models provide
necessary psychosocial support to GDY and their families. In this K08 proposal, Dr. Sequeira will build on her
existing research with GDY, their families, and community pediatric providers to: 1) identify existing barriers
BIPOC and rural GDY experience to receiving gender-affirming care and explore design and implementation
considerations for facilitating access to care via telehealth, 2) develop a Technology-based Enhanced Gender
Support (TEGS) platform to facilitate comprehensive gender-affirming care provision in the community
pediatric setting, and 3) conduct a pilot study to determine the feasibility and acceptability of TEGS platform
use in the community setting. In addition, this K08 award will provide the necessary skills and preliminary data
to inform the development and submission of a future R01 proposal to conduct a randomized trial to evaluate
the efficacy of TEGS platform use on GDY’s mental health and perceived care needs as well as community
provider knowledge and behavior."
10796963,"Project Summary
Cancers take many years to develop, and death due to a cancer may occur many years after diagnosis.
Therefore, it is important to use innovative methods of analysis to make optimal use of all exposure data
both before and after diagnosis. We propose four types of innovations in the current application.
Lethal cancer models: Of highest public health interest is what risk factors predispose a disease-free
subject to die due to a specific cancer in the future. We have previously developed models for lethal
cancer by integrating models for cancer incidence with models for prognosis after a cancer diagnosis. In
this application, we propose to extend this approach in the case of colorectal cancer (CRC) by
considering three stages in the carcinogenic process: (a) development of advanced polyp, (b)
development of incident CRC after advanced polyp have been identified and removed, and (c) death due
to CRC among patients with incident CRC.
Latency models: Some prospective studies have risk factor data available at several points in time. One
issue is how these data should be optimally used to predict cancer incidence. One approach is to use the
most recent exposure; a 2nd approach is to use the total duration of exposure; a 3rd approach is to
introduce a lag between exposure and outcome assessment. In this application, we propose a latency
model to estimate the optimal weighting of previous exposures to predict cancer incidence; these
models enhance understanding of biological mechanisms for specific risk factors.
Cure Models: There have been many studies of risk factors predicting mortality among cancer patients.
However, for some cancers, if patients do not die from their cancer over a given period of time (e.g.,
within 5 years for CRC), then they are unlikely to ever die due to their cancer, and will probably die due
to another cause (i.e., they are cured). But what are the risk factors that predict cure? Although cure
models have been used before, they mostly are based on post-diagnostic risk factors. To our knowledge,
this is the 1st proposal to consider pre-diagnostic risk factors as predictors of cure.
Assessing Effects of Screening on CRC risk models: Colonoscopy is the current standard for CRC
screening. It is unique, in that if pre-cancerous lesions (i.e., adenomas) are found, then they are
removed, and the natural history of CRC progression is interrupted. However, even if these lesions are
removed, for some subjects, these lesions are more likely to develop again at a future time. Thus, it is
challenging how to control for effects of screening in CRC risk models. In this application, we propose an
innovative approach to control for screening by both assessing effects of a risk factor on adenoma
incidence, and effects of adenoma incidence on CRC risk."

Despite legislation and federal initiatives, such as the Pediatric Device Consortia Grants Program, intended to
facilitate pediatric medical device development, innovation for pediatric cardiac patients continues to lag behind
the advances made for adult devices, making children requiring reconstructive heart surgery an underserved
population. All implantable biomaterials (glutaraldehyde bovine pericardium, xenograft valves and conduits,
cryopreserved allografts, autologous pericardium, and collagen bioscaffolds) as well as some artificial polymers
are subjected to structural degeneration driven by calcification (via passive calcium deposition and absorption of
calcium-binding proteins) and – as discovered by our group – by glyco-oxidation, which via permanent
incorporation of glycated protein and cross-links formation, alters the architecture and mechanical proprieties of
biomaterials.
This resubmitted application has two overarching goals: to understand the mechanisms of accelerate structural
degeneration of cardiac patches, valved conduits, and bioprosthetic heart valves in children and to test mitigation
strategies to extend the lifespan of these devices in vitro and in vivo by using juvenile animal models. Clinically,
the goal is to reduce the need for multiple cardiac re-operations in pediatric patients by mitigating the
mechanisms at the base of the accelerated failure. Preliminary results include a pediatric-specific bioregistry of
explanted cardiac devices, the development of precision medicine susceptibility assays using sera from pediatric
patients and adults, global proteomic analysis of absorbed proteins, and the utilization of two juvenile animal
models (rat subcutaneous implants of bovine pericardium and juvenile sheep undergoing surgical or
transcatheter aortic, mitral, or pulmonary valve replacement) to assess the role of enhanced protein absorption,
and calcification. We also developed methodologies to mitigate protein absorption. Based on these data will test
the hypothesis that mitigation of protein absorption of implantable biomaterial will reduce calcification and
structural degeneration of implantable biomaterial. Since our published and preliminary data, as well as
supporting literature, show that glycation and calcification precursors are overexpressed in children, we believe
that our mitigation strategies will be particularly efficient in pediatric patients. Overall, this project aligns with one
of the core missions of the NIH-NHLBI to improve the durability of multiple pediatric medical devices via a
precision medicine approach."
10931365,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although multiple myeloma (MM) is the most common blood cancer in Black/African American (AA) individuals,
AA patients have been significantly underrepresented in MM research studies and clinical trials. MM has one of
the most pronounced disparities in the incidence and mortality between AA and European American (EA)
patients. As MM research has largely focused on patients of European ancestry, it remains unknown whether
disparities in the incidence and outcomes of AA and EA patients are due to differences in healthcare access
and/or socioeconomic, environmental, or biological factors. Large-scale studies comparing variation of the MM
tumor, its tumor microenvironment (TME) and disease survival among AA patients and incorporating calculated
African ancestry are critically needed. Our long-term goal is to identify important factors contributing to the health
disparity in AA patients with MM. The overall objective of this proposal is to characterize the genetic variations
of the MM tumor, its TME, and the impact of this variation on disease survival in a large, well-powered study of
AA patients with MM. We hypothesize that AA patients have favorable MM tumor genetics but a greater
immunosenescent TME, which can affect response to therapy and overall survival. The following specific aims
will be evaluated: 1) Differentiate the genetic variations of MM tumors between newly diagnosed AA and EA
patients; 2) Analyze the MM tumor microenvironments of newly diagnosed AA and EA patients; and 3) Compare
the responses to treatment of MM tumors in newly diagnosed AA and EA patients. In specific aim 1, 1500 newly
diagnosed MM patients (480 AA and 1020 EA) from two independent cohorts will be used to determine the
frequency of risk-defining tumor genetic abnormalities, genome-wide genomic complexity, and mutation
signatures. Differences in disease survival will be compared in relation to these risk-defining genetic
abnormalities and the influence of race. In specific aim 2, 200 newly diagnosed MM patients (100 AA and 100
EA) from Mayo Clinic cohort will be used to analyze the TME signatures using RNAseq and validated using
CyTOF. Differences in disease survival will be compared in relation to these TME signatures and the influence
of race. In specific aim 3, 100 newly diagnosed MM patients (50 AA and 50 EA) from Mayo Clinic will be used to
evaluate tumor responses to therapeutic regimens using an ex vivo drug sensitivity platform. Genetic and
transcriptomic predictors of ex vivo drug response will be assessed, and top targets and novel agents will be
evaluated using human myeloma cell lines. This proposal is significant because understanding MM tumor
genetics and TME in AA patients will allow for improved treatment selection and prognostication in this
underserved population."
10829462,"Project Summary/Abstract
The objective of this project is to characterize a new therapeutic target in order to improve breast cancer therapy
by preventing breast cancer from spreading and restoring the effectiveness of hormone therapy. While estrogen
receptor (ER) is the most successful therapeutic target in breast cancer, up to one-third of breast cancers lose
ER expression and thus do not respond to hormone therapy. The mechanisms for ER loss in the majority of ER-
negative breast cancers remain to be investigated. On the other hand, despite most breast cancers are
diagnosed during relatively early stage, nearly 30% of them will eventually develop metastasis after treatment.
We have now identified 14-3-3tau as a key driver that promotes breast cancer metastasis and ER loss in vivo.
We have established a 14-3-3tau xenograft model which recapitulates metastasis and loss of estrogen receptor
expression as seen in patients with high levels of 14-3-3tau in their breast tumors. We also developed a new in
vitro 3D breast cancer spheroid model of ER loss. This proposal will investigate how 14-3-3tau promotes the
evolution of breast cancer from ER-positive to ER-negative and endocrine resistance, and use the established
3D spheroid culture and animal models to identify the drugs capable of blocking these adverse effects. Some
small molecule inhibitors for the proposed pathways have been available in clinics or been tested in clinical trials
for other conditions. Thus, if confirmed, it would be quite feasible to test them in patients with tumors harboring
high levels of 14-3-3tau, which are found in over 60% of breast cancer. Through the examination of 14-3-3tau
expression in the breast tumor samples, we might be able to identify the patients who are at risk of developing
metastasis and losing response to endocrine therapy. These patients may benefit from treatment with these
inhibitors targeting the downstream effectors of 14-3-3tau to prevent endocrine therapy resistance and
metastasis. Some of these inhibitors have already been approved for other diseases or are available in clinical
trials. Thus, the potential impact of this proposal in providing a novel therapeutic strategy to prevent breast
cancer metastasis and to reverse endocrine therapy resistance in breast cancer is very significant."
10841670,"SUMMARY
Pain is a highly debilitating condition that is complex and difficult to manage. The neural basis of pain involves
alterations in thalamocortical (TC) circuitry functioning, which can manifest as TC dysconnectivity and
dysrhythmia (especially, impaired alpha oscillations). While likely reflecting inherently coupled (spatial and
temporal) aspects of TC circuitry dysfunction, to date, TC dysconnectivity and dysrhythmia have only been
examined independently, precluding fundamental understanding and effective intervention of this important
pathology of pain.
Capitalizing on our fully developed multimodal neuroimaging methodology (simultaneous EEG-fMRI and
combined EEG-MEG-fMRI) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), the current R01 aims to
address this critical gap. Aim 1 (Expt. 1) will directly link the spatial (via fMRI TC connectivity) and temporal
(via EEG/MEG alpha oscillations) aspects to demonstrate coupled spatiotemporal alterations in TC circuitry
functioning in experimental (tonic) and clinical (chronic low back) pain. Aims 2 & 3 will causally unify and
upregulate the coupled spatiotemporal TC circuitry functioning in experimental and clinical pain, as causal
manipulation of one aspect (TC dysrhythmia) via tACS of alpha oscillations (α-tACS) induces TC-circuit-wide
functional restoration. Implementing a rigorously controlled experiment with a double-blind, double-controlled
(active and passive control), crossover tACS design (Expt. 2), Aim 2 will establish an experimental model of
this hitherto unexplored mechanism of pain. Through four weeks of α-tACS among patients with chronic low
back pain (Expt. 3), Aim 3 will ascertain this unified TC circuitry pathology of pain (and reveal potential
therapeutic effects of neuromodulation of alpha oscillations).
Leveraging special but complementary expertise and facilities of our two labs, the three Aims pursue a broad
and in-depth investigation, translating basic experimental insights into mechanistic understanding of acute and
chronic pain. The project also emphasizes rigor and reproducibility through parallel recruitment of large and
diverse samples (200 healthy participants and 140 patients) and multi-point cross/within-site validation and
integration. Findings from this project will cast a “new look”—a unified spatiotemporal account—on TC
pathology of pain and hence inspire novel pain treatments."
10841048,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Age is the number one risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA), however, the mechanisms that drive age-associated
joint changes and how these contribute to cartilage damage are not well defined. As OA joint tissues age, it is
well established that cartilage-forming stem cells (CSCs) display a significant decline in their ability to
differentiate, and the joint environment becomes more inflammatory. Both of these factors together undermine
the ability to recover from injuries and also contributes to the failure of autologous stem cell therapies. Thus, we
propose an innovative dual strategy which will address both. We hypothesize that activation of sirtuin 6 (SIRT6)
will rejuvenate older CSCs, and apoptosis signal regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) inhibition will reestablish a
regenerative environment in the joint. Together, this novel solution has the potential to greatly augment the ability
for CSC differentiation and cartilage repair in the aged population. We will test this hypothesis and determine the
epigenetic mechanisms that SIRT6 regulate in the following three Aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the
mechanisms by which (a) SIRT6 activation and (b) ASK1 inhibition enhance the cartilage-forming differentiation
and pro-survival activities of aged CSCs. In Aim 2, we will determine the efficacy of SIRT6 activation, in the
presence of ASK1 inhibition to stimulate cartilage formation in aged, male and female rodents. Finally, in Aim 3,
we will determine the efficacy of SIRT6 activation and ASK1 inhibition to promote cartilage regeneration and
repair in response to chondral injury in a pre-clinical aged minipig model. These Aims will be achieved through
comprehensive in vitro analysis of young and old (male and female) CSCs and macrophages, in proof-of-concept
aging rodent models (mice and rats), and a clinically relevant large animal chondral defect model (aged minipig).
Importantly, the findings from this proposal are likely to give unique and important insights into the role of
epigenetic regulation of aged cells and the role of the surrounding environment in other aging and diseased
tissues. If successful, the overall impact of this novel pro-regenerative therapy to ameliorate the ravages of aging
and joint injury would represent a significant advancement in the treatment of age-associated diseases, such as
OA. Additionally, it will lead to the discovery of new disease-modifying treatments for other organ systems and
increase the ability of the aged population to live a healthy, mobile life."

Chemotactic behaviors, movements toward or away from chemicals in an organism’s environment, play
important roles in the lives of bacteria. Chemotaxis enables microbes to form communities such as
biofilms, to find and colonize host organisms, and to successfully carry out complex, multi-host life
cycles. Better understanding of how bacteria detect and respond to their chemical environment will
play an important role in the development of new therapeutic strategies for preventing and treating
bacterial infections. The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate, in molecular detail, the in vivo
signaling mechanisms of the transmembrane receptors that mediate chemotactic behavior in E. coli, a
model system for chemotaxis studies.
The serine chemoreceptor Tsr forms stable ternary complexes with two cytoplasmic proteins – a
histidine autokinase (CheA) and a scaffolding protein (CheW) that couples CheA activity to
chemoreceptor control. These signaling complexes are organized into highly cooperative arrays,
typically located at the cell poles, that detect chemical stimuli with high sensitivity over a wide range of
concentrations. The overall objectives of the next project period are to elucidate the mechanisms of
signal transmission through chemoreceptor molecules and how those ligand-induced conformational
changes modulate CheA activity in receptor signaling complexes.
Our overall working hypothesis about signal transmission within chemoreceptor molecules proposes
that its structural subelements – external ligand-binding domain, transmembrane helices, HAMP and
methylation helix bundles, and cytoplasmic hairpin tip that interacts directly with CheW and CheA –
transmit and process sensory information through shifts in their dynamic behaviors and stabilities.
Neighboring elements are coupled in opposition, such that destabilizing inputs to one element produce
stabilizing responses in the other. The interplay of these opposing structural forces poises the receptor
molecule to detect and respond to small stimulus inputs.
The project will test these signaling ideas by exploiting in vivo crosslinking assays to detect and to trap
different output-related structures in Tsr and CheA molecules. We will characterize the signaling
properties of mutant or crosslinked proteins with in vivo serine dose-response assays based on Förster
Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). Collaborations with other groups will provide molecular dynamics
simulations to assess the structural and dynamics changes in mutant signaling proteins and cryo-
electron microscopy to examine structural features of mutant receptor arrays at enhanced resolution."

If science is to inform policy and ultimately improve public health, the field needs an effective strategy for directly
supporting policymakers’ use of research evidence. However, our field lacks an evidence-based model designed
for supporting state policymakers’ use of prevention research in crafting legislation. Instead, we continue to
largely rely on ad hoc strategies for translating prevention research (e.g., opportunistic outreach and responding
to policymakers’ requests if or when they are made). Accordingly, we propose an experimental study of a formal,
theory-based approach for supporting policymakers’ use of scientific evidence that does not involve lobbying—
the Research-to-Policy Collaboration (RPC) Model. The RPC fosters productive engagement between the policy
and research communities by implementing systematic capacity building and outreach strategies. Previous
experimental work on the RPC demonstrated the ability of this model to increase engagement between
researchers and policymakers, increase policymakers’ value for research evidence, and improve their use of
scientific evidence in their policymaking.1 We propose a state-level randomized controlled trial of the RPC (N =
30 state legislatures) that will evaluate the model’s ability to improve engagement between state policymakers’
and the prevention science community, build policymakers’ awareness and value of substance misuse
prevention research, and subsequently their use of research evidence throughout the policymaking process. To
accomplish this, we will test three specific research aims. Aim 1 will assess historical and current use of research
evidence in state legislation pertaining to substance misuse prevention. This will involve qualitative coding of
bills introduced by state legislatures over the last five years. Aim 2 will compare the frequency and quality of
engagement with prevention researchers between the intervention and control conditions. Additionally, we will
assess how the RPC model influences policymakers’ value and awareness of substance misuse prevention over
time using a validated survey across three time points. Aim 3 will evaluate the effectiveness of the RPC on
legislators’ actual use of research in legislation by observing and quantifying changes in legislator behavior
related to research use. Improving the use of scientific information in policymaking can reduce population-level
substance misuse by increasing the availability of evidence-based prevention programs and policies."

Dilation & curettage (D&C) is one of the most common surgical procedures performed on women throughout the
world. Intrauterine adhesions (iUA), or Asherman, develop in about 40% of women who undergo D&C in the
postpartum (6 week period after birth), but is very rare after D&C in nonpregnant women (<1%) for reasons that
are not well understood. It is a debilitating condition characterized by intrauterine fibrosis and scarring. Patients
with iUA suffer from infertility, recurrent pregnancy loss and a broad range of dangerous pregnancy complications
(e.g. preterm birth). While endometrial mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (eMPCs) are crucial for endometrial
repair, the role of these cells and underlying molecular mechanisms in this postpartum susceptibility of the
endometrium to fibrosis and abnormal repair are unknown. This application is specifically focused on defining
the role that eMPCs and their stromal fibroblast progeny play in abnormal uterine repair. The central hypothesis
is that eMPCs of the recently postpartum uterus are more senescent and inherently different in their response to
uterine injury compared to eMPCs of the nonpregnant uterus, leading to fibrosis and scar formation. The
approach is to use our novel postpartum mouse uterine injury model which recapitulates the susceptibility of the
human postpartum uterus to injury. Using it, we will define the dynamic changes in eMPCs and their differential
response to uterine injury in the postpartum vs. nonpregnant, identify using lineage tracing the eMPC subsets
that become the profibrotic fibroblast cells, and conditionally ablate each of these eMPC subsets to define their
functional role in endometrial fibrosis (Aim 1). We will obtain fresh human endometrial tissue from women
undergoing postpartum D&C and compare it to nonpregnant tissue using innovative single cell technology and
functional in vitro studies to gain detailed insights into the cellular and molecular differences that predispose the
human endometrium to form iUA (Aim 2). In Aim 3, we will obtain archived endometrial specimens from the time
of inciting D&C event from women who developed Asherman vs. non-Asherman. We will use the
innovative deterministic barcoding in tissue spatial multi-omics sequencing (DBiT-seq) platform and
integrate it with immunofluorescence to gain detailed molecular insights regarding eMPCs and their cell
interactions within the tissue, identifying novel therapeutic targets for iUA prevention. The proposed aims
are conceptually and technically innovative and together will have a broad impact on the field by filling a
substantial gap in our fundamental knowledge of endometrial biology and infertility pathogenesis using Omics
approach, which are major research priorities of the Fertility and Infertility Branch of the NICHD.
Ultimately, the knowledge gained from this proposal will not only be invaluable to our understanding of many
more subtle conditions of abnormal endometrial repair, but provide unique insights into the body’s
physiological anti-fibrotic wound healing mechanisms leading to a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of
fatal idiopathic fibrotic diseases in other organs."

We discovered that sleep deprivation causes accumulation of free radicals (reactive oxygen
species, ROS) and oxidative stress in the gut of flies and mice. This is in large part responsible
for the premature death seen when sleep is very low. Here we propose to study what occurs
upstream and downstream of ROS accumulation. Specifically, we will ask how the lack of sleep
leads to increase in ROS, and how ROS then causes organismal death. Together, this will bring
us closer to fully understanding what sleep does for health and longevity. This is an important
problem as so many of us are chronically sleep deprived, and sleep deprivation causes or
exacerbates a whole slew of diseases."
10865000,"Candidate: Dr. Gregory Madden is an Assistant Professor of Infectious Diseases at the University of Virginia with
experience in research regarding the diagnosis, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of C. difficile infection.
Career Development Plan and Goals: The proposed K23 Mentored Career Development Award will uniquely
establish Dr. Madden as a translational researcher with experience in host-pathogen interactions and advanced
modeling techniques. Training activities for the award include graduate-level coursework in clinical trial design
and statistical modeling, culminating with a Master’s Degree of Science in Clinical Research.
Research Plan: Clostridioides difficile is the leading healthcare-associated pathogen in the US. Evidence
suggests that the host innate immune system (particularly Type 2, or eosinophil-mediated immunity), fecal C.
difficile burden, and Binary toxin play important roles in C. difficile infection. However, no model to predict
outcomes of C. difficile infection takes these factors into account. Data from our lab show that eosinopenia,
specific biomarkers of pathogenic immunity (i.e., Soluble ST2 Receptor, IL-6), fecal organism burden, and the
presence of fecal Binary Toxin are associated with increased C. difficile mortality. Dr. Madden, proposes to: 1)
Construct a clinical-immunologic database of C. difficile patients to develop a robust biomarker-based
model for outcomes of C. difficile infection and 2) Prospectively validate this model alongside the leading
clinical models. Successful completion of the proposed research will create a validated immune profile for C.
difficile infection outcomes that reflects our latest understanding of pathogenesis. In addition, we will identify a
much-needed optimal approach for researchers and clinicians to stratify life-threatening C. difficile infection at
the time of diagnosis.
Mentors: Dr. Madden’s mentor is Dr. William A. Petri, MD, PhD, a leading researcher in the field of host defense
against C. difficile. Internal advisors and collaborators have diverse expertise in hospital epidemiology (Dr. Costi
Sifri, accomplished practicing hospital epidemiologist with a background studying molecular pathogenesis),
immunology (Dr. Melanie Rutkowsi, PhD, biostatistics/machine learning (Jennie Ma, PhD), clinical trial design
(Dr. James A. Platts-Mills, MD), and molecular diagnostics (Eric R. Houpt, MD).
Environment: The University of Virginia is world-renowned for its work in enteric diseases and is one of the first
institutions to establish a School dedicated to Data Science. The University of Virginia Data Science Institute,
School of Public Health Sciences, Office of Hospital Epidemiology, and the Petri Lab will provide the resources
as well as the diverse and stimulating environment for this Candidate to flourish as an independent investigator

10813865,"Project Summary Abstract
The 26S proteasome conducts most regulated protein degradation and eliminates toxic proteins from cells. The
proteasome is a validated anti-cancer target, and holds substantial promise as a target for treatment of
neurodegenerative disorders and some infectious diseases. Our long-term goal is to understand how the three
major complexes of the proteasome—the lid, base, and core particle—engage and communicate within and
between one another. We have thus far made significant progress toward this goal and have developed a number
of novel tools and reagents that have furthered our understanding of intra- and inter-complex communication.
Conceptual advances have included: i) discovery of additional conformational states of the yeast proteasome
relevant to substrate catalysis; ii) demonstration that six highly similar ATP-hydrolyzing subunits differentially
influence the activation state of the proteasome; iii) discovery of a link between the conformational state of the
proteasome and release of a dedicated proteasome assembly chaperone; and iv) and the finding that
proteasomal subcomplexes disengage one another prior to their destruction by autophagy.
A paradigm emerging from this initial budget period is that rather small binding events or molecular movements
are transmitted, often over long distances, to enact largescale conformational changes. Understanding how such
local events are amplified and transmitted to distant areas of the proteasome to coordinate assembly and
catalysis is thus a critical knowledge gap. In this first renewal, we propose three Aims that explore examples of
this paradigm newly discovered by us during the initial budget period. Together, they will push our knowledge of
proteasome dynamics and inter-complex communication into new arenas. In the first, we will use newly
developed FRET-based kinetic assays to decipher how local changes to the lid-base interface regulate the timely
binding and release of dedicated assembly chaperones from nascent proteasomes. In the second, we will
explore a surprising allosteric conduit originating from the substrate unfolding center of the proteasome that
regulates the stability between two key subcomplexes. In the third Aim, we will investigate an unusual eukaryotic
proteasome from a poorly studied human parasite from the phylum of Microsporidia. Microsporidia lack several
proteasome subunits that normally span a key inter-complex interface. The missing subunits contain several
small sequence elements with essential roles in assembly and catalysis in other eukaryotes, so exploring these
unusual proteasomes will thus reveal both conserved and unique elements of inter-complex communication.
These studies are anticipated to produce important insights into the engagement and communication between
the proteasomal subcomplexes, significantly advancing several aspects of proteasome biology and drug
discovery. Further, microsporidia are NIH priority pathogens of interest for which no broadly effective treatments
exist. Insights into microsporidial proteasomes thus may reveal new targets to combat certain parasitic infections."
10802423,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Biomarkers that reliably inform the selection of therapy or prognosis for patients with head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are lacking. This can result in the use of overly aggressive or ineffective therapy with
the associated negative impact on quality of life and mortality. Thus, there is a great need for the development
of non-invasive biomarkers that accurately predict response to therapy or prognosis of HNSCC. Emerging data
suggest that analysis of the cargos of small (30-150 nm) extracellular vesicles (sEV), also known as exosomes,
in body fluids is a promising approach to the detection of non-invasive biomarkers in cancer, including HNSCC.
In cancer patients, plasma sEV are mixtures of tumor-derived exosomes (TEX) and vesicles produced by non-
malignant cells (NTEX) such as leukocytes. We found that TEX are a prominent but variable subset of sEV in
HNSCC patients’ plasma. TEX recapitulate the content of tumor cells, while the molecular cargo of NTEX
resembles that of non-malignant leukocytes, largely T cells, reprogrammed by TEX. Our data indicate that both
these sEV subsets mediate immune suppression and influence responses to therapy. We hypothesize that in
HNSCC patients, TEX as well as NTEX mediate immune suppression and are responsible for poor prognosis
and resistance to anti-cancer therapies. Using a novel immune capture-based technology, we will separate TEX
from NTEX in HNSCC patients’ plasma and will then simultaneously evaluate these two sEV subsets as potential
biomarkers. In Aim 1, we will establish efficacy of the immune capture strategy for TEX and NTEX isolation from
HNSCC patients’ plasma and determine the potential of these sEV subsets to serve as biomarkers of cancer
and immune competence, respectively. Levels as well as phenotypic profiles and immunosuppressive functions
of the two sEV subsets will be evaluated and assessed for their ability to discriminate HNSCC patients from
healthy donors (HDs). In addition, high-resolution (HR) LC-MS/MS will be used to identify proteins in TEX and
NTEX that could be utilized as prognostic or predictive biomarkers. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the utility of TEX
and NTEX as biomarkers of prognosis in patients with locally advanced HNSCC treated with standard of care
therapy (N=200). Utilizing TEX and NTEX isolated from well-annotated existing pre-treatment plasma samples,
nanoflow cytometry, functional assays, and targeted HR LC-MS/MS will be used to assess phenotypic profiles
and immunosuppressive functions. We will correlate TEX and NTEX plasma levels and profiles with clinical
endpoints. In Aim 3, we will investigate the utility of TEX and NTEX as biomarkers of response to anti-PD-1 mAb
immunotherapy in HNSCC patients diagnosed with recurrent/metastatic disease (N=80). TEX and NTEX
characteristics will be assessed as in Aim 2, and we will evaluate whether they are predictive of the efficacy of
anti-PD-1 mAb therapy. The simultaneous assessment of TEX and NTEX in plasma of HNSCC patients will
confirm the role of these two sEV subsets as biomarkers of cancer as well as of cancer-induced defects in
immune competence. Importantly, these biomarkers, alone or together, have the potential to guide selections of
therapies that will improve outcome and reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with HNSCC."
10906787,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal concerns age restricted in-person location policies (ARLPs), a novel tobacco control strategy that
could have a critical impact on reducing youth tobacco use. Under an ARLP, tobacco sales would only be allowed
in tobacco shops or other adult-only retailers. As the majority of tobacco retailers are convenience stores and
discount stores, ARLPs could drastically reduce tobacco retailer density, and thereby reduce adolescent and
young adult (“youth”) tobacco access and marketing exposure. Moreover, as convenience and discount stores
are often disproportionately prevalent in historically marginalized neighborhoods, ARLPs may reduce disparities
in tobacco retailer density. Evidence is badly needed to support the introduction of ARLPs to the United States.
Data are needed from models of the potential reduction in tobacco retailer density, the potential reduction in
youths’ “focal retailers” (i.e., the retailers that youth frequently encounter or use the most for tobacco purchases),
the potential impact on youth behavior, and the potential compensatory behaviors by youth (e.g., obtaining
tobacco through alternative sources). Woven into these questions is the critical concern of equity impact: Will an
ARLP reduce current disparities in retailer density and youth tobacco use? The goal of this project is to model
the potential impact of ARLPs on youth tobacco use, both overall and for different priority populations (defined
by residence in low-income, racial/ethnic minority, or rural neighborhoods). Aim 1 will use spatial statistical
methods to model the potential impact of an ARLP on tobacco retailer density. Across four states (California,
Connecticut, North Carolina, and Ohio), investigators will geocode the locations of all current tobacco retailers
to model an ARLP’s impact on the retailer landscape. Pairing this environmental data with behavioral data from
a diverse cohort of young people living in those states, Aim 2 will use geographic ecological momentary
assessment (EMA) to (a) identify young people’s most focal retailers and (b) model the extent to which exposure,
access, and use stemming from these focal retailers would be impacted by an ARLP. Investigators will enroll
480 youth (120 per state; ages 16-25; 80% tobacco users; 50% priority population) to collect this real-world,
close-to-real-time geographic EMA data. Analyses will model whether an ARLP would have prevented purchases
and marketing exposures to a significant extent—particularly among the priority population youth. Finally, Aim 3
will use survey and qualitative methods to determine potential compensatory behaviors by youth. Subgroups of
tobacco users will participate in focus groups and all tobacco users from the cohort will be asked to complete an
online survey. Analyses will assess whether obtaining tobacco from alternative sources will be harder for priority
(vs. non-priority) youth. An external advisory board of key partners will inform all stages of the project, particularly
dissemination. Successful completion of this project will provide much-needed information to support equity-
enhancing state and local ARLPs. In the long-term, such efforts will contribute to reducing and eventually
eliminating tobacco-related health disparities by promoting health equity among all populations."

The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a common critical illness characterized by severe
hypoxemia in response to either direct (e.g. viral pneumonia) or indirect, systemic (e.g. sepsis) insults to the
lung. Most patients with ARDS will develop delirium, defined by acute, fluctuating disturbances in cognition.
Delirium during ARDS is strongly associated with poor outcomes including long-term disability and death.
Despite this clinical significance, the mechanisms responsible for delirium in ARDS remain poorly understood.
 One recent scientific advance with direct relevance to delirium in ARDS is the endothelial glycocalyx, a
chondroitin sulfate (CS)-rich layer that lines the vascular lumen. The glycocalyx is degraded early in lung injury,
releasing large concentrations of CS into the bloodstream with resultant increases in hippocampal CS content,
a brain region implicated in delirium pathogenesis. Remarkably, the presence of elevated levels of highly-
sulfated CS subtypes in humans with critical illness is associated with risk of delirium. In preliminary
experiments, I observed that these same highly-sulfated CS subtypes can directly potentiate the activity of α-
amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
acid
receptors (AMPARs), the primary excitatory ion channel
in the brain. This activation of AMPAR activity may be biologically relevant to delirium during ARDS, as I have
observed concordant increases in neuronal excitability in the hippocampi in a lung injury model.
 The work outlined in this proposal will investigate the importance of AMPAR potentiation by CS in the
pathogenesis of delirium in both direct and indirect forms of ARDS. My work seeks to 1) determine if CS is
predominantly released from the pulmonary endothelial glycocalyx during lung injury and if release is
heparanase-dependent, 2) determine if hippocampal-penetrating CS is responsible for increased AMPAR
excitability, and 3) determine whether pulmonary-endothelium derived CS contributes to the pathophysiology of
delirium in ARDS through hippocampal AMPAR potentiation. Through these investigations, I will gain expertise
in modeling of direct lung injury, isolated perfused lung preparations to isolate and assess pulmonary
physiology and pulmonary endothelial biology, ex vivo whole-cell electrophysiology and in vivo
electroencephalography in murine hippocampi, and a murine behavioral measure relevant to human delirium.
 These highly-novel studies will allow me, as an early career physician-scientist, to develop a unique
expertise studying the lung-brain axis in delirium, while generating essential preliminary data for future
independent research awards (e.g. R01)."

The core pillars of academic medicine that serve as the foundation for the training and development of the clinical
workforce are widely recognized to be education, research and exceptional patient care. Physician-investigators
represent the lifeblood of academic medicine and recent declines in the numbers of this group represent nothing
less than an existential threat to academic medicine as it is currently known. Our commitment to work to reverse
these trends serves as the basis now for our Stimulating Access to Research in Residency (StARR) program
proposal. The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) Department of Medicine (DOM) has a vibrant clinical program
that provides excellent healthcare services to an inner city population of predominantly African-Americans and
Hispanic/Latinx patients, in the third largest metropolitan area in the middle of our nation. Our physicians provide
care for patients at the UIC Hospital and Clinics (UI Health) and the Jesse Brown Veterans Affairs Medical
Center. Stimulated by the opportunities and scientific questions that are presented by this large and unique
patient base and active collaborations with outstanding basic science departments at UIC, the entire research
portfolio at UIC has been rapidly expanding. At the same time, our internal medicine residency program has
been committed to recruiting physicians in training, from diverse backgrounds and life experiences, who are
dedicated to our mission. Core to this mission are our ongoing efforts to assume a leading role nationally in the
training, growth and development of the next generation of clinician investigators. Notably, the UIC DOM is
primely positioned to support this program by virtue of its highly accomplished prospective faculty mentors from
across a broad range of research disciplines, a well-established pre-existing commitment to promoting scholarly
activities including research amongst trainees and faculty, opportunities to synergize with three existing NHLBI-
sponsored T32 training grants within the department, and an internal medicine residency program with core
structural components already in place to promote resident research opportunities and career development.
Additionally, a key element of our proposal is a commitment to the recruitment of a diverse group of resident-
investigators including underrepresented minorities (URM). It is important to note that the UIC StARR program
will build on already existing programs and infrastructure with closely aligned goals and objectives. Our program
also has the full and unwavering support of the UIC College of Medicine and its leadership."

Down Syndrome (DS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by trisomy of chromosome 21, and with age a
majority of DS patients develop neuropathological hallmarks associated with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), including
amyloid plaque deposition and astrogliosis, as well as clinical dementia (cooccurrence of DS with AD is DS-AD).
Amyloid precursor protein (APP) mutations are linked to AD, and DS patients have triplication of the APP gene,
suggesting this as a contributing factor to the overlapping pathology. Research suggests astrocytes are
regulators of both DS and AD disease progression. Astrocytes modulate synapses through the release of
secreted proteins, and recent work suggests that astrocyte protein secretion is dysregulated in both DS and AD.
The Allen lab identified >700 astrocyte-secreted proteins dysregulated in the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS at
neonatal timepoints. Of interest, secretion of the pro-growth protein pleiotrophin (Ptn) was >4x down-regulated
from Ts65Dn astrocytes, and subsequent investigations of Ptn knockout mice revealed that they phenocopy
Ts65Dn mice in many aspects, including decreased dendrite length and spine density. Single nucleus RNA-
Sequencing studies show that subsets of “disease-associated” astrocytes in AD down-regulate transcripts
encoding for many pro-synaptogenic factors, including Ptn. The main hypotheses of this proposal are that: 1)
a network of overlapping astrocyte-secreted proteins is altered in DS-AD and AD, and 2) decreased Ptn secretion
from astrocytes contributes to disease progression in DS-AD and AD. This proposal takes an unbiased approach
to characterize changes in the astrocyte secretome in DS-AD and AD mouse models, as well as a targeted
approach to investigate the potential for Ptn to rescue neuropathological phenotypes. Aim 1/K99 utilizes biotin-
mediated proximity labeling (an endoplasmic reticulum localized TurboID virus) to create novel datasets for the
in vivo astrocyte-specific secretome in DS-AD and AD mouse models at early, middle and late stages of disease.
This aim provides the investigator with extensive training in mass spectrometry technology and quantitative
proteomics analysis. Aim 2/R00 employs viral-mediated Ptn overexpression in astrocytes to investigate if Ptn
can rescue spine density, astrogliosis and spatial memory impairments in DS-AD and AD mouse models.
Additionally, the investigator will utilize the astrocyte-specific secretome datasets from Aim 1 to investigate other
protein candidates in their future laboratory. The mentoring team consists of Dr. Nicola Allen, a leader in astrocyte
biology; Dr. Alan Saghatelian, who will provide expertise in quantitative proteomics; Dr. Jolene Diedrich, mass
spectrometry core director; Dr. Nick Andrews, behavioral core director; and Dr. Douglas Galasko, a neurologist
specializing in dementia and Associate Director of the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) at the
University of California San Diego (UCSD). The work will take place at the world class Salk Institute for Biological
Studies and establish networking connections at the ADRC and UCSD, providing an essential foundation for Dr.
Brandebura’s independent research career focused on astrocyte-secreted proteins in neurodegeneration."

Integrative analysis methods are in great needs as multimodal multi-cohort neuroimaging data rapidly emerge in
neuro science. In Alzheimer's Disease (AD) studies, many research relies on multimodal neuroimaging data to
identify key image biomarkers for the early diagnosis of AD. Despite great endeavors in data collection, there still
lacks rigorous statistical methods and efﬁcient computational tools to properly integrate big neuroimaging data in
a statistical model and carry out inference to address practical problems. Important problems such as missing
data and adjustment for between-subject heterogeneity still remain unsolved. In this proposal, we propose to
build two integrative models, one handles multimodal data and the other handles longitudinal multi-cohort data.
They will be built under a generic M-estimation framework that covers many widely used statistical models as its
special cases. We will provide various inference tools for these models and develop efﬁcient algorithms to solve
the M-estimation problem in presence of block missing values. In Aim 1, we propose a factor-adjusted integrative
model for multimodal data and provide a complete set of inference tools. These tools can test the signiﬁcance of
one whole data modality as well as the signiﬁcance of multiple linear combinations of predictors from one or more
modalities. In Aim 2, we provide a powerful computational tool to handle block missing values of multimodal data.
Such a tool does not need to perform ad-hoc imputation on missing values, but rather relies on an innovative mini-
batch gradient descent algorithm to yield a good estimator. In Aim 3, we will develop an interactive factor model
to jointly model longitudinal data coming from multiple cohorts. We show that such a model includes the standard
random effects model as a special case and is more ﬂexible modeling the longitudinal data and accounting for the
between-subject heterogeneity. The proposed research will likely transform how we analyze neuroimaging data
and enhance our understanding of Alzheimer's Disease and its relation to public health."
10817842,"Understanding Diabetes Heterogeneity via Mining Multimodality Interconnected Data
Abstract. Diabetes is a prevalent and highly heterogeneous disease that incurs tremendous human, economic, and so-
cial costs globally. Prediabetes and early-stage type 2 diabetes often do not have single strong indicates or symptoms,
posing great challenges for early detection and intervention. Moreover, once into a later-stage, diabetic patients are at
high risk of developing various health problems such as heart disease, vision loss and kidney disease, which further com-
plicates effective healthcare and may eventually lead to consequences from blindness to amputations to limited social
interactions due to mobility. Unfortunately, current subtyping of diabetes has failed to decouple such heterogeneity.
Recent remarkable advances in biotechnology have led to a signiﬁcant production of high throughput patient data such
as electronic health records (EHRs), multi-omics, and structured surveys, providing tremendous promises to powerful
quantitative approaches towards the understanding of diabetes heterogeneity. However, existing machine learning (ML)
models ignore the higher-order interconnections among various disease variables, thus failing to differentiate complex
ﬁne-grained subtypes and extract subtle corresponding phenotypes– regarding speciﬁc combinations of disease vari-
ables. Moreover, most existing studies focus on single sources of data such as clinical, molecular or behavioral, failing to
discover integrative biomarkers towards even more effective disease detection, analysis and treatment. Often case, these
methods also rely heavily on dataset-speciﬁc feature preprocessing and fail to transfer from one cohort to another.
As a computer scientist aiming at bridging data science and diabetes management, I have developed a well-structured
training pan in this proposed K25 project, and my primary goal is to develop a high-impact and practical ML system that
can be used to perform precise detection, in-depth analysis and cost-effective treatment of diabetes. To fully decouple
the heterogeneity of diabetes from complex patient data, I propose (1) a hyper-hetero-graph data structure (H2G) to
facilitate the comprehensive representation of patients and deep identiﬁcation of diabetic characteristics regarding the
interconnections among various disease variables and (2) a specialized graph neural network model (H2GNN) capable
of modeling H2G along with a temporal component to capture the full trajectories of disease progression and a self-
clustering component to identify novel subtypes of diabetes. Leveraging the national All of Us dataset from NIH with
EHRs, genomics and surveys of 329K+ patients (42K+ diabetic), I propose to (1) apply the model to clinical data (EHRs)
towards precise early diabetes detection, (2) incorporate molecular data (genomics) towards in-depth diabetes patho-
logical analysis, and (3) further incorporate behavioral data (surveys) towards personalized diabetes treatment design.
Finally, we will iteratively evaluate our system and its discovered subtypes based on both All of Us and our independent
local dataset NELL curated from Emory Healthcare System with multimodality data of 295K patients (39K diabetic).
This project is consistent with NIDDK's commitment to translational research on chronic diseases, and aligns well with
ADA's recent initiative towards diabetes precision medicine. Results of this project will also inform the development of
powerful quantitative approaches for a broader spectrum of diseases."

Nearly 30% of all cancer deaths are attributable to tobacco use. Tobacco taxes have positively impacted the
prevalence of tobacco use and subsequently the incidence of tobacco-related cancers. The objective of this
project is to provide critical insight for tobacco control, by developing and testing a novel integrated tax proposal
based on the abuse liability of tobacco and nicotine products in the unique Experimental Tobacco Marketplace
(ETM), including how this proposal may interact with tobacco-related socioeconomic cancer disparities. The ETM
is an experimental model to forecast, before implementation, the effects of potential public health policies on
patterns of tobacco purchasing, including between-product substitution. The ETM places the mix of products,
prices, and specific regulations under experimental control to provide estimates of policy impact under conditions
that simulate “real-world” circumstances. To achieve these goals, three aims are proposed. Aim 1 will develop
an integrated abuse liability ranking of commercial tobacco and nicotine products through a systematic review
and a novel application of network meta-analysis. Aim 2 is a proof-of-concept study that will examine the impact
of different tax strategies based on the abuse liability of tobacco products in a laboratory-based sample of
cigarette smokers. Aim 3 will examine the equity of the most effective abuse liability dependent tax strategy by
testing its effects in a nationally representative prospective sample of lower, medium and higher socioeconomic
status smokers. These aims support the candidate’s long-term goal to become an independent researcher
investigating the differential impact of policies on tobacco initiation, use and cessation among individuals who
experience tobacco-related cancer disparities. To further support this goal, a mentored career development plan
is proposed, consisting of training in the fields of advanced statistical methods including network meta-analysis,
tobacco products abuse liability, government tax policies, and tobacco-related cancer disparities. The advice,
guidance and technical expertise provided by the candidate’s mentoring team, collaborators and consultant, and
the Virginia Tech’s supportive research environment will provide the resources necessary to successfully
complete the research and training plans. Importantly, this K01 award will provide the training, mentoring, and
research experiences needed for a highly competitive R01 application to compare the abuse liability dependent
taxes to other existing tax proposals. As importantly, this proposal will provide the essential first step in launching
an independent cancer-related research program focusing on developing and testing novel policies for the
elimination of tobacco use and its unequaled harms."
10825577,"Project Summary/Abstract. Neuroimmune signaling through TLR (Toll-like-receptor) pathways modulate
ethanol behaviors in mammals and flies. An output of these pathways are NFκB transcription factors. The fly
NFκB gene called Dif is an output of the Toll signaling pathway in adult flies. Dif modulates ethanol sensitivity—
increased Dif activity reduces sensitivity, while decreased Dif increases sensitivity. Because NFκB is a well-
known transcription factor, it has been axiomatic that its effects are produced by an action in the nucleus. In
addition to the well-known nuclear and cytoplasmic locations, NFκB has also been observed at the postsynap-
tic density. In mammals, synaptic activity has been described as causing the translocation of NFκB from the
synapse to the nucleus where it modifies gene expression in ways that alter synaptic plasticity. However, from
Drosophila there is strong evidence that NFκB proteins can directly modulate the synaptic machinery. The Dif
gene produces two NFκB protein isoforms by alternative mRNA splicing. These are DifA and DifB. The focus of
this proposal is DifB. The DifB isoform is only expressed in Drosophila CNS neurons, where it is specific to the
mushroom bodies (well known to influence ethanol behaviors), antennal lobes, and the subesophageal gan-
glion of the brain. The DifB isoform lacks a nuclear localization signal and a transcription activation domain.
DifB biochemically co-fractionates with a synaptic protein and away from a nuclear protein. Immunohistochemi-
cal staining confirms that DifB localizes to synaptic regions but does not enter the nucleus even following im-
mune activation. Splice variant–specific mutations show that the DifB isoform modulates the sensitivity to seda-
tion with ethanol but does not contribute to immunity. Whereas the nuclear DifA isoform is essential in the
immune response but does not contribute to the ethanol response.The objective of this proposal is to
identify DifB interacting proteins in order to better predict how DifB modulates ethanol sensitivity. We
have used CRISPR to build flies that express a variety of epitope-tagged DifB (& DifA) isoforms. These will be
used in coimmunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry experiments to identify proteins that physically interact with
DifB. Based on biochemical fractionation, imaging, and evolutionary comparison with a related protein, we ex-
pect the interacting proteins to be synaptic proteins. The extragenomic action of an NFκB is an unexplored and
rapid way in which Toll pathway signaling can modulate ethanol responses. The description of the protein:pro-
tein interactome of the extragenomic NFκB encoded by DifB will be a significant contribution because it will
provide us with the keys for understanding how this protein modulates neuronal signaling and behavior. Fur-
thermore, understanding how an NF-kB can directly modulate the synapse may also contribute to our under-
standing of the origins of the unusual consequences of neuroimmune dysregulation such as impaired brain
function, the exacerbation or cause of mental illnesses, and neurologic complications of Covid-19 disease."

Loss of healthspan - declining health and function as we age – impacts nearly every living organism and is a
pronounced feature of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), affecting nearly 6 million people in
the United States. Lipids are poorly understood central components of aging, having roles in healthy aging and
diseases of aging. The gap in lipid knowledge begins with a missing definition of ‘normal’ and extends to a lack
of understanding surrounding lipid fluctuations throughout life. Lipid homeostasis is an important component of
the healthy brain and both aging and multiple diseases are associated with alterations in lipid populations and
lipid droplet (LD) volume and count. Dysregulated lipid homeostasis is linked to inflammation, diabetes, forms
of liver failure, Gaucher disease, Parkinson’s disease, ADRD, and untold more pathologies. The failure to
understand lipids in health and disease can be explained by a lack of adequate tools to study lipids. With the
wide adoption of mass spectrometry tools, we recently entered the lipidomic era in which lipids can be
characterized in fine structural detail across a range of lipid classes with spatial sensitivity and relative or
absolute quantity. Spatial lipidomics using multimodal mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) produces regio-, cell-,
and organelle-specific lipid maps and reveals changes in tissue sections even when traditional, extracted
lipidomic studies fail to show changes. While progress has been made in spatial mapping of brain lipids in
aging and AD, these studies were limited by scope (lacking total lipid coverage, spatial resolution, and
structural specificity). Here, we will use leading edge high specificity and resolution spatial lipidomics to
describe the most thorough spatial lipid survey of aging brains possible, to date, using a combinatorial
approach. We will produce characteristic lipid fingerprints based on age, sex, disease state, and brain region.
These lipid fingerprints will be supported with phenotypic data and spatial transcriptomic data. These end result
will be an important resource for the aging and lipid research communities and will lead to new, translational
therapeutic approaches."

Project Summary/Abstract
The goal of the Dana Farber/Harvard Cancer Consortium Career Development Program in Clinical Oncology
(DF/HCC K12) is to prepare the next generation of clinical investigators in oncology to work at the interface of
laboratory science, clinical medicine, and population science. The DF/HCC K12 was first funded in 2002 and
has supported 32 Scholars. The funded Scholars have been exceptionally successful, with an output of 215
publications and 46 grants for Scholars graduating in the past 10 years, and all Scholars progressing to
independent research careers in industry or academic positions. We propose the following Specific Aims for
the renewal of this K12 to continue training physician/scientists from diverse disciplines:
Aim 1: We will recruit and select a diverse group of K12 Scholars. We will issue an annual Request for
Applications (RFA) using a variety of mechanisms to reach the widest possible pool of candidates. We will
aggressively promote the participation of women and other groups traditionally under-represented in medicine.
An Internal Advisory Committee (IAC), comprised of 16 DF/HCC faculty members with leadership roles and
established track records in original research and mentoring, will assist Program Leadership with Scholar
selection. We request a continuation of support for five Scholars per year with two-year appointments and the
potential for one additional year contingent on sufficient progress and continued demonstration of a need for
mentored support.
Aim 2: We will provide a program of rigorous didactic training, career development, and mentored
clinical oncology research. Each Scholar will be guided by two Faculty Mentors, one for laboratory (or data
science) training, and one for clinical investigation. A group of 35 highly qualified and motivated Faculty
Mentors have been identified, but Scholars may elect to include additional mentors from the pool of >1,100
investigators within the seven DF/HCC institutions, as well as faculty from the Koch Institute at MIT and the
Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT. An individualized career development plan will be devised that includes
components of required and optional didactic training, hands-on laboratory research, and development of a
clinical trial. Specific required training has been included that focuses on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.
Aim 3: We will monitor the performance and refine the K12 Program to optimize recruitment and
training of new investigators in clinical oncology research. The IAC will review annual progress reports
from Scholars and Mentors and make recommendations for changes in mentoring and/or research focus, as
needed. An External Advisory Committee (EAC), comprised of five PDs from other successful K12 Programs,
will evaluate Program performance, participate in an annual retreat, and provide recommendations for Program
enhancements to the K12 Leadership. The Program will track Scholar productivity, including presentations,
publications, promotions, grants, and clinical trial activity on an annual basis."

 This R01 confirmatory efficacy clinical trial application involves telehealth delivery of a treatment
approach to improving core cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, using an experimental therapeutic design that
NIMH has advocated. Our telehealth intervention approach combines neurotrophin-releasing aerobic exercise
training with neuroplasticity-based cognitive training to enhance the impact of cognitive training on cognition.
Telehealth cognitive training and telehealth physical exercise training address the NIMH strategic research
priorities for creating innovative interventions that can be “disseminated broadly” and “readily taught to the
existing workforce with minimal cost.” Cognitive training and physical exercise have each been shown
separately to improve cognitive deficits in schizophrenia to some degree, and our previous research has
shown that when combined they show promise of improving cognition and work/school functioning more than
either treatment alone. In our preliminary studies, comparing the combined treatment with cognitive training
without aerobic exercise, we find evidence of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) target engagement,
differential improvement in cognition, and prediction of later cognitive outcome from initial BDNF gain. The
portability of the proposed intervention outside of academic research programs will be demonstrated by
providing the interventions via videoconferencing. The proposed study will incorporate additional methods,
such as Fitbit wrist-worn fitness trackers, web-based motivational support, and personalized text messages to
encourage motivation and to maximize participation in the exercise condition. We will use Mature BDNF as
our primary target and cognition as our primary outcome. We hypothesize that the increases in Mature BDNF
associated with regular aerobic exercise provide a platform which allows neuroplasticity-based cognitive
training to enhance cognition more quickly than is typically observed in studies of cognitive training alone. We
hypothesize that combining aerobic exercise with cognitive training will produce larger cognitive improvements,
relative to cognitive training without exercise, with all interventions conducted remotely via videoconferencing.
Further, we hypothesize that a greater proportion of exercise sessions completed will be associated with
greater cognitive improvement. The research will also test whether intrinsic motivation at baseline and
increases in intrinsic motivation over time predict the extent of participation in the telehealth physical exercise
program. Cognitive deficits in persons with schizophrenia are a major influence on their everyday functioning in
the community. We target the period shortly after a first episode of schizophrenia to maximize the
generalization of cognitive improvement to real-world functional outcome, before chronic disability is
established. This telehealth cognitive training plus aerobic exercise clinical trial has the potential to test a
hypothesized mechanism of action and to make a meaningful difference in the lives of individuals with severe
mental illness."

Vaccination is our most important preventative therapy against infectious disease. Protective immunity at
mucosal sites has the potential to prevent re-infection by stopping invasion of the host. The small intestinal
mucosa is amongst the most common sites of infection, but the mechanisms of vaccine-induced immune-
mediated protection at this site remain relatively unknown. The primary target of an effective vaccine is the
creation of long-lived B cells and T cells that provide durable protection. How CD4+ T cells might contribute to
vaccine-mediated protection is unclear. We have developed a model of oral vaccination with an attenuated
version of the E. coli heat labile toxin (LT) that induces large populations of vaccine-specific CD4+ T cells that
are necessary for protection against re-infection. Using MHC class II tetramers we demonstrated that oral
vaccination induces a long-lived population of LT-specific intestinal memory CD4+ T cells share a
transcriptomic signature with Tissue-resident memory T cells (Trms). LT-specific T cells also expressed genes
associated with enteric nerve function and after vaccination CD4+ T cells were observed adjacent to enteric
nerves. Our hypothesis is that oral vaccine-specific CD4+ Trms protect the intestine by interacting with nerves
to activate motility and physically expel enteric pathogens upon re-encountering their antigen. To test this
question we need to develop a novel T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mouse, specific to a dominant MHC
class II-restricted antigen from LT. Via adoptive transfer of LT-specific TCR transgenic memory T cells we can
test the hypothesis that these cells are sufficient to mediate protection against enteric infection. Further, LT-
specific TCR transgenic T cells can be easily identified in tissues using congenic markers and we propose to
use them to identify which nerves oral vaccine-activated CD4+ T cells interact with in the small intestine. At the
conclusion of this grant we will have developed a first in its kind TCR transgenic mouse that will drastically
increase our ability to make important discoveries about the biology and protective effects of CD4+ Trms in the
small intestine, but also will undoubtedly be of use to the scientific community interested in oral vaccines."
10772170,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are devastating neurodegenerative diseases
without available therapy. Epidemiological data suggest that traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a risk factor for ALS and FTD;
TBI, ALS, and FTD share several pathological findings, including neuronal and axonal degeneration, neuroinflammation,
and mislocalization of TDP-43. Axonal pathology, an early event after TBI, promotes TDP-43 dysregulation and may serve
as a trigger for neurodegenerative processes. Axon loss can be driven by a genetically encoded program governed by the
axon destruction factor SARM1, rendering it an attractive target for treating many neurological diseases. We and others
have reported that SARM1 clearly promotes TBI-associated neurodegeneration and a role for SARM1 has also been
proposed in ALS/FTD. Since most cases of ALS/FTD are sporadic, involving multiple risk factors, we will test the
hypothesis that the adverse role of SARM1 in ALS/FTD is revealed in mice using a “two-hit model” (TBI combined with a
C9orf72 ALS/FTD gene defect) that reflect the combined risks of a harmful environmental stimulus with genetic risk in
sporadic ALS/FTD patients. The most common cause of dominantly inherited ALS and FTD is a hexanucleotide repeat
expansion (HRE) in the C9orf72 gene (c9ALS/FTD). However, it remains to be established whether (1) TBI can trigger
events that accelerate pathology and clinical disease in HRE carriers, and (2) whether there are interventions to blunt the
impact of TBI and attenuate adverse neuropathological events. Our pilot data provide proof-of-concept that repetitive mild
TBI (rTBI) causes extensive neuronal and axonal loss and persistent neuroinflammation at 12 months after injury in a
transgenic C9orf72 (C9BACtg/tg) mouse model. In Aim1 we will conduct a time-course experiment in non-transgenic and
transgenic C9BACtg/tg mice to quantify pathology in frontal and temporal cortices for up to 12 months after rTBI or sham
surgery. We will use immunohistochemistry markers for neurons, axons, microglia, astroglia, and TDP-43; WB and qPCR
for TDP-43 expression; cytometric bead array for interleukin-1β expression; fluorescence in situ hybridization for RNA
foci; and Meso Scale Discovery assay for dipeptide repeats as markers of c9ALS/FTD pathology after rTBI or sham surgery.
A battery of motor and cognitive tests will be used to assess behavioral deficits. These experiments will test the hypothesis
that following rTBI c9ALS/FTD mice will manifest exaggerated behavioral, microscopic, and molecular pathology, and
accelerated disease-onset. In Aim2 we will use our established colony of C9BACtg/tgxSarm1-/- mice, to conduct a time-
course experiment analogous to Aim1 to ascertain if genetic ablation of Sarm1 attenuates neurodegeneration and behavioral
deficits following rTBI. These experiments will test the hypothesis that following rTBI, behavioral, microscopic, and
molecular pathology will be attenuated in c9ALS/FTD mice by inactivation of Sarm1. Together, these experiments will
illuminate mechanisms underlying c9ALS/FTD after rTBI by identifying cellular and molecular response pathways and
providing insights into principles governing the interplay between TDP-43 and neurodegeneration in c9ALS/FTD. Our
studies may also define SARM1 as a therapeutic target to mitigate the devasting consequences of this and other TBI-
associated neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD)."
10934517,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The secretory pathway is responsible for the biogenesis of soluble and membrane proteins involved in
communication, energy transduction, nutrient uptake, and defense. These proteins are synthesized in the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and then trafficked to Golgi and other organelles such as the plasma membrane.
This trafficking causes ER stress by accidental exodus of ER-resident proteins such as UDP-glucuronyl
transferases (UGT’s). These are type I membrane proteins (T1MP’s) responsible for modifications of lipid
hormones and of analgesics acetaminophen and morphine. These ER-resident T1MP’s display a dibasic
sequence (Lys-x-Lys-x-x or Lys-Lys-x-x; x=any amino acid) in their cytosolic tail for ER-retrieval by the coatomer
protein I complex (COPI). The α and β’ subunits of this hetero-heptameric complex bind this dibasic sequence
to initiate T1MP packaging into vesicles originating from post-ER compartments such as cis-Golgi. These COPI
coated vesicles traffic and deliver the T1MP proteins back to ER to restore secretory balance. However, the
atomic principles underlying T1MP binding, release, and selective interactions with α and β’COPI subunits are
not well understood. This is a critical knowledge-gap as T1MP release and escape from COPI modulate T1MP
trafficking, post-translational modifications, and T1MP functions. COPI dysfunction has been implicated in a
variety of disorders related to development, auto-immunity, and cancers. Our long-term objective is to gain
fundamental insights into COPI-dependent retrograde trafficking of T1MP’s and the underlying atomic-level
factors responsible for COPI dysfunction in diseases. In this grant, we will elucidate mechanistic insights into
COPI recruitment, release, and T1MP post-translational modifications utilizing the coronavirus (CoV) spike
protein, a T1MP with a dibasic Lys-x-His-x-x sequence, as a new model system. This dibasic sequence ensures
COPI-dependent retrograde delivery of the spike from Golgi to the viral progeny assembly site in ER-Golgi
intermediate compartment (ERGIC). In Aim 1, we will elucidate the atomic details of conformational modulation
of COPI-spike interactions. In Aim 2, we will determine the principles that govern release from COPI and
subsequent post-translational modifications of the spike. In Aim 3, we will elucidate the atomic basis of COPI
subunit selectivity for the spike protein. These investigations will expand on a toolkit of spike mutants with
modified COPI interactions, as recently published by our group. We will integrate structural approaches in X-ray
crystallography, NMR, and Rosetta modeling with biophysical tools and cellular assays of secretory trafficking to
gain unprecedented insights into fine modulation and conformational regulation of COPI-spike interactions. The
innovative use of the spike protein as a T1MP model system will yield novel insights into fundamental secretory
trafficking. These data will simultaneously opening avenues for the development of targeted therapeutics for
COPI-selective disorders and for a deeper understanding of CoV assembly and processing of CoV vaccines."

Although the estimated lifetime risk of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection can be as high as 75% in unvaccinated
women, the actual risk of developing cervical cancer is only ~0.68%. This indicates that exposure to HPV alone is
insufficient for the development of cervical cancer and that HPV infections likely require the presence of a biological or
cellular induced “co-factor” to help trigger oncogenesis. As the most common bacterial sexually transmitted pathogen and
because it too is a significant threat to the reproductive health of women, Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) infections are
increasingly being linked to gynecological cancer development as epidemiological reports indicate that co-infections with
Ct and HPV are relatively common. Meta-analyses of the epidemiological data and the early investigations into the putative
role of Ct in gynecological cancers have implicated the cellular immune response to chlamydial infection as a potential co-
factor that can enhance the host’s susceptibility to HPV-induced cervical cancers. We and others have shown that the
immune response to Chlamydia infection results in genital tract pathology and our most recent report shows that TLR3
deficiency in HUMAN oviduct epithelial (hOE) cells alters the immune response to Ct infection, resulting in increased
chlamydial replication. We also recently reported that Chlamydia infection induces the syntheses of cellular factors that
disrupt cell-cell junctions in genital tract tissue and that TLR3 deficiency leads to increased monolayer permeability during
Chlamydia infection. Our data support other studies showing that Chlamydia infection can disrupt the protective epithelial
barrier function, and we also presented evidence that TLR3 plays a role in maintaining the integrity of the epithelial barrier
during genital tract Chlamydia infection. Therefore, we hypothesize that Chlamydia infection disrupts epithelial barrier
function (which is in part modulated by TLR3), and the barrier disruption will allow better access to the underlying basal
cell layers and thereby can increase the infectivity of HPV. In this proposal, we will test our hypothesis that Ct can serve
as a co-factor in HPV-infection-induced cervical cancer by: (1) examining whether Chlamydia infection or secreted
products of Chlamydia infection can enhance the attachment and entry of HPV into their target cells, (2) determining if
TLR3 signaling modulates the impact that Ct has on increasing HPV infectivity, and (3) ascertaining if genital tract
Chlamydia infection will make mice more susceptible to subsequent papillomavirus infections. Confirmation of our
hypothesis would reveal novel insight into Ct-HPV coinfection, the role of TLR3 in altering outcomes of coinfection, and
implicate TLR3 as a potential target for therapeutic interventions to prevent Ct-triggered oncogenesis in HPV-infected
patients."

Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive decline of brain
functions, progressive loss of synapses, neuronal death, brain atrophy and formation of extracellular amyloid
plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a type I
transmembrane glycoprotein which plays a central role in AD pathogenesis, as the precursor of the beta
amyloid peptide (Aβ), the main component of amyloid plaques. In addition, several mutations on the APP
gene are associated with the early-onset hereditary form of the disease (Familial Alzheimer disease or FAD).
Apart from being the precursor of the toxic Aβ peptide and the carrier of FAD mutations, APP has been
associated with a wide range of biological functions, including proliferation, neuronal development,
intracellular transport, Ca2+ homeostasis, neurite outgrowth, shaping of dendritic complexity and, most
importantly, synaptogenesis and synaptic function. Indeed, multiple reports link APP to the regulation of spine
density, spine dynamics and synaptic plasticity. Reported synaptic roles of APP both in the presynaptic active
zone and postsynaptic density include regulation of presynaptic nicotinic receptors, facilitation of
neurotransmitter release, regulation of synaptic vesicle recycling and regulation of the cell surface expression
and activity of NMDA receptors. Deregulation of one or more of the above functions is therefore likely to lead
to synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration, also basic hallmarks of the AD. APP is part of a gene family,
with two more mammalian members, the Amyloid Precursor Like Protein 1 (APLP1) and the Amyloid
Precursor Like Protein 2 (APLP2). Both APLPs are highly homologous to APP, with similar molecular
architecture and functions, especially related to synaptogenesis, spine dynamics and synaptic plasticity. The
goal of this proposal is to develop suitable experimental resources for performing structural investigations of
the physiological functions of APP and APLPs. To achieve this goal, we propose to establish an expression
and purification pipeline for medium throughput screening of APP, APLP1 and APLP2 orthologs, investigate
an alternative tagging procedure and compare extraction and reconstitution methods for a subset of orthologs.
Finally, we propose to utilize single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) to elucidate atomic-level
details of the molecular architecture of APP family proteins. High-resolution structural information of a full-
length APP family protein will enable us to better understand the structural basis of the physiological functions
of APP and APP-like proteins and inform our understanding of how these functions are deregulated in AD."

Adoptive transfer of T cells genetically engineered to express CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptors (CARs)
have achieved tremendous clinical success in treating patients with refractory and relapsed B-cell leukemia.
Since the approval of CD19 CAR-T cells in 2017 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), research in
the field has grown exponentially, ranging from therapies for melanoma and solid tumors, induction of
transplantation tolerance to treatment of autoimmune diseases. Despite these successes, the treatment also
has severe toxicities due to the excessive immune responses. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS), manifesting
as serum cytokine over-production, fever, hypotension, and multiple organ dysfunction/failure, is one of the
major side effects that can cause permanent damage to patients if left without proper clinical intervention.
While clinical protocols have been developed to mitigate the pathophysiology of CRS in clinic, the underlying
mechanisms responsible for the excessive cytokine secretion remains not fully understood. One of the major
hurdles is the lack of preclinical models that can fully recapitulate the CAR-T cell-mediated immune
interactions.
Hematopoietic humanized (hu) mouse models are a powerful platform to bridge the gap between preclinical
studies and clinical CRS, and have been instrumental in developing novel therapies to mitigate CRS-
medicated toxicities. However, recreating the complex human immune system in these mice is challenging, as
they don’t have a human thymus, the primary lymphoid organ responsible for the generation and selection of T
cells. Although the endogenous mouse thymus can provide limited support for human T cell development,
human T cells generated in mouse thymus cannot properly engage with other human immune cells to regulate
effective immune responses. We have recently developed a tissue-engineering method to generate human
thymus from inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). iPSC-derived human thymus can support the de novo
generation of a functional human T cell compartment in hu mice that can mediate both cellular and humoral
immune responses. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that hu mice engrafted with iPSC-thymus can
recapitulate the complex interactions between the human immune system and cancer cells under CAR-T
therapy, and serve as a powerful model to study CRS pathophysiologies for the discovery of novel therapies.
In this exploratory project, we are going to establish and characterize a CD19 CAR-T/B-lymphoblastic cancer
model with the iPSC-thymus engrafted hu mice to recapitulate CRS and its associated toxicities. If successful,
the project will have broad impacts in the field of immunotherapy."
10835964,"ABSTRACT
Despite decades of eradication efforts, malaria remains a global cause of morbidity and mortality, with the
greatest burden caused by Plasmodium falciparum and largely affecting young children in Sub-Saharan Africa.
One malaria vaccine has recently been approved by the World Health Organization; however, improved
vaccines are needed and are likely essential for malaria eradication. Unfortunately, our understanding of
protective immunity to malaria remains limited. Within the human host, the parasite propagates through several
life cycle stages in various organs, expressing multitudes of antigens at each stage, many of which remain
uncharacterized. To add to the challenge, many surface-exposed antigens are studded with amino acid
polymorphisms that result in immune system evasion, and some epitopes elicit immune responses that are not
actually protective. Serum profiling of multiple genetically diverse antigens will improve our understanding of
protective immunity to malaria and drive the design of better vaccines. Limited attention has been given to
isotype composition of the antibody response to malaria, and IgA, though previously underrecognized, appears
to be a prominent component. While most seroprofiling studies examine antibody responses to whole proteins,
study of antibody responses to peptides that comprise the proteins allows for discernment of precise antibody
binding sites on the protein surface, which can inform vaccine design. This research will focus on IgA and IgG
antibody responses to malaria infection in two groups: (1) infants and children living in Mali, West Africa who
were followed for three to four years and (2) infants living in Malawi, Southern Africa, who were followed from
birth to two years. Both groups were in settings with high malaria transmission and had active and passive
surveillance for malaria infections. Antibody reactivity to peptides representing hundreds of P. falciparum
proteins including antigenic variants will be measured following first and repeated malaria infections on
PepSeq, a novel peptide library platform that has not previously been used in malaria. Epitopes recognized by
serum IgA and IgG after malaria infection will be identified, and a longitudinal study design will allow for the
study of the magnitude, kinetics, and isotype ratio (IgA/IgG) of the antibody response to malaria. In summary,
this work will answer critical questions about the IgA response to malaria infection, identify epitopes and
proteins for exploration as vaccine candidate antigens, and provide new data on the antibody response to
antigenic variants. Overall, the findings will improve our understanding of the immune response to malaria and
inform vaccine design."
10823333,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In the US, Lewy body dementias (LBD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affect over 7 million people. No treatment
slows their inexorable decline. Broad evidence implicates malicious roles of α-synuclein (ASyn), tau and Abeta
(A) proteins in these dementias. LBD and AD are characterized by the sequential misfolding of ASyn, tau and
A into toxic oligomers and fibrils that propagate in prion-like fashion and accumulate in pathological deposits,
with ASyn the predominating pathology in LBD and A and tau pathologies predominating in AD. ASyn or A
precursor gene alterations cause LBD and AD respectively. Although central to disease, ASyn, A and tau mis-
folding have been challenging to target therapeutically. ASyn, tau and A pathologies correlate with LBD and
AD decline. Elevated levels of the stress-induced chaperone Hsp70 protects against ASyn misfolding and neu-
rodegeneration in LBD cell and animal models. However, there is minimal mechanistic understanding of this
important protective pathway. In particular, it is generally assumed that the canonical and promiscuous mode of
Hsp70 action underlies Hsp70-ASyn protection. Consequently, translational investigations have been stymied
by the anticipation of undesirable side effects of therapeutically targeting Hsp70 canonical actions. Our data
contradict this assumption, providing a potentially more targeted and exploitable mechanism of Hsp70-mediated
protection in disease. We find that Hsp70 blocks the earliest and most neurotoxic stage of ASyn misfolding,
ASyn oligomerization, by interacting at a previously unknown site separate from its canonical site of action. It is
therefore plausible that targeting this non-canonical mechanism would protect against disease. Importantly, this
approach holds the potential to correct ASyn misfolding without disrupting critical cellular processes. Our central
hypothesis is that this novel, non-canonical blockage of ASyn oligomerization by Hsp70 is protective in LBD and
AD. The next steps to support and exploit this hypothesis are to determine the molecular mechanism of Hsp70’s
engagement with ASyn, to validate this mechanism as protective, and test its action on additional AD/LBD pro-
teins. In Aim 1, we will determine the critical molecular residues in Hsp70 for blockage of ASyn oligomerization
and toxicity. We will use state-of-the-art cryo-EM microscopic approaches to capture how ASyn binds to Hsp70
with atomic resolution and validate the role of this binding through mutational analysis in LBD-relevant biochem-
ical and cellular ASyn oligomerization and toxicity assays. This will directly test our hypothesis that non-canonical
Hsp70 engagement of ASyn underlies its activity in blocking ASyn oligomers and in providing protection against
ASyn toxicity in neurons. In Aim 2, we will determine the impact of Hsp70 non-canonical action on oligomeriza-
tion of additional AD and LBD-relevant protein species, including lipid-bound ASyn and tau and A proteins.
Confirming an effect of non-canonical Hsp70 action on multiple pathogenic proteins would greatly expand the
therapeutic potential of this effect, and suggest that non-canonical Hsp70 plays a broader and so far unsuspected
role in many additional biological processes."

 Bacterial attachment to host cells is a critical step for pathogenesis. Thus, the prevention of bacterial
attachment to host cells is an ideal target to halt disease progression. A severe lack of knowledge of the
attachment mechanism of Burkholderia species greatly inhibits our ability to develop effective treatment
strategies. Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc), consisting of more than 20 species of Gram-negative bacteria,
poses a major threat to public health. Bcc causes severe opportunistic lung infections in cystic fibrosis (CF)
patients worldwide. CF is a life-threatening condition with no cure and treatment of CF-related infections is
difficult. There are about 30,000 people with CF in the United States and more than 70,000 people worldwide.
Bcc is also a group of significant pathogens leading to nosocomial infections in other immunosuppressed
individuals highlighted by several outbreaks of infection.
 Our significant research discovery of a novel surface attachment protein from Burkholderia pseudomallei
(Sap1Bp), a previously uncharacterized hypothetical protein, has provided an opportunity to investigate a new
and, seemingly, universal attachment mechanism exploited by many Burkholderia species. Sap1Bp is functionally
conserved across many Burkholderia species, including Sap1 from clinically relevant members of Bcc (Sap1Bcc).
There are many attachment mechanisms employed by Bcc and they are complex. However, no associated
receptor partners from host cells have been discovered to date, leaving significant knowledge gaps in the
understanding of attachment mechanisms in the Bcc. We found that Sap1Bcc contributes significantly to Bcc
attachment to the host cells and is required for complete Bcc pathogenesis in multiple animal models. Moreover,
we discovered the Sap1 host-cell receptor to be the glycoprotein non-metastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB),
which is associated with various cancers and Alzheimer's disease, revealing a novel and unique interaction that
has never been exploited by any bacterial pathogens to attach and invade host cells.
 In this application, we proposed to explore the mechanisms of this important surface attachment protein
Sap1Bcc to interact with its host-cell receptor GPNMB in vitro and the importance of this interaction for in vivo
pathogenesis. Aim 1A will characterize Sap1Bcc and GPNMB interaction at the molecular level by determining
their interaction affinity and defining the key residues for attachment function, which is critical for future study of
its virulence mechanism. Aim 1B seeks to functionally characterize the roles of GPNMB in Sap1Bcc-dependent
Bcc attachment to GPNMB knockout and overexpression cells. Aim 1C will investigate the role of GPNMB during
Bcc murine infection to determine if the interaction between the novel virulence factor Sap1Bcc and its host cell
receptor GPNMB directly contributes to disease. Detailed characterizations of this newly discovered Sap1Bcc
/GPNMB interaction could provide potential drug-target and alternative therapeutic strategies toward better
treatment outcomes of Bcc infection."

Abstract
The Center for Synthetic Regulatory Genomics (SyRGe) is tasked with development and
application of revolutionary technology for making dramatic, coordinated changes to
extensive gene loci in the form of Big DNAs of 50-1000 kb, which enable broad
investigation of the function of regulatory sequences and foster translational applications
to biotechnology, personalized medicine and aggressively humanized mouse models.
Specifically, we will (i) enhance our Design – Build – Deliver Technology pipeline ot
make it ever more efficient and precise, ii) enable “Bottom up” fully synthetic regulatory
landscapes, as well as multilocus engineering in both cells and animals, culminating in
projects to look at brain function and behavior iii) deploy combinatorial genomics at the
level of Big DNA, iv) Develop new tools to engineer megabase changes to mammalian
genomes in a locus-agnostic manner and v) Develop imaging technology to “light up” the
Big DNA molecules we are delivering.
The Center will dramatically supersede present and predicted technologies for
manipulation and assessment of Big DNAs. Some of this work will culminate in the
production of extensively humanized animal models called Genomically Rewritten and
Tailored Genetically Engineered Mouse Models (GREAT-GEMMs), an element of our
program worthy of bioethical debate and discussion. The Center also features a unique
and highly successful outreach program whereby undergraduates from diverse
backgrounds play a crucial role in genome assembly, as well as a Fellows program to
expose researchers and students from other fields to transformative new technology and
facilitate its promulgation throughout the larger human genetics, model organism and
genomics communities. Finally, mechanisms to ensure long-term sustainable access to
the technology developed in this Center to anyone who wishes to deploy it have been
put in place."

Tuberculosis (TB) presents an ongoing global challenge to medical science that will only be met by multiple
approaches. Due to the length of even “routine” TB therapy and the age of existing drugs – which contributes to
the emergence of devastating resistant forms of the disease – the discovery of new drugs, especially those that
function by new mechanisms of action, has become critical. In early 2019, a team including the present laboratory
reported AU 8918 as the first high-quality inhibitor of 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PptT). PptT, which
catalyzes the placement of a 4'-phosphopantetheinyl moiety onto a client carrier protein, is essential for the
biosynthesis of mycobacterial fatty acids and virulence factors. PptT represents a valuable anti-TB target
because (1) it is essential for mycobacterial tuberculosis (Mtb) survival in vitro and in mice, (2) it is divergent
from the closest host ortholog, and (3) it is distinct from all targets of established TB drugs. In addition, its
inhibition has been shown (4) to effectively kill Mtb including multi- and extensively-drug-resistant variants and
(5) to block Mtb growth in mice, while (6) sparing other bacterial or mammalian cells. The primary hit compound,
AU 8918, has an IC50 of 2.3 M in biochemical assays of PptT inhibition, a MIC90 of 3.1 M against Mtb in vitro,
and has some physical properties features consistent with advancement as a drug candidate, but suffers from
off-target cardiotoxicity likely associated with sodium channel blockade.
The present proposal seeks to support an ongoing collaboration between three laboratories that share the
common goal to design, synthesize, and characterize PptT inhibitors suitable for pre-clinical development. The
availability of five high resolution co-crystal structures of AU 8918 and analogs bound to Mtb PptT has been
leveraged to establish a robust in silico modeling protocol for the preliminary assessment of analogs. Several
avenues to create novel PptT inhibitors are proposed, including (1) SAR exploration of AU 8918, (2) discovery
and exploration of new scaffolds arising from bioisosteric replacements of the amidinourea subunit of AU 8918,
and (3) new hits arising from an ongoing screen against PptT. We will characterize inhibitors by (1) biochemical
PptT inhibition, (2) X-ray crystallography of inhibitor•PptT co-crystals, and (3) advanced biochemical
characterization (including intracellular macrophage activity measurements, verification of on-target activity by
knockdown/knockout studies, safety profiling against off-target liabilities, pharmacokinetic and metabolic
characterization, metabolomics, and synergy studies). The final goal of the project is to identify 1–2 advanced
compounds for advancement to in vivo studies in Mtb infected mice, having the following properties: (<0.1 M
potency against PptT, <1 M MIC90 against Mtb, retention of positive physical properties, and lacking
cardiotoxicity or activity (>30 M inhibition) at relevant Ca and Na channels."

KRAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene with mutation rates of 95% in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDAC), 45% in colorectal cancer, and 30% in lung adenocarcinomas. The most common K-RAS mutations
occur at codon 12, namely G12D, G12V, G12C, and G12R. K-RAS was considered undruggable due to lack of
well-defined drug-binding pockets. But a recent breakthrough was achieved with covalent inhibitors that form a
bond with K-RAS G12C cysteine. Several of these compounds are in clinical trials, and one was given FastTrack
status by the FDA. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of K-RAS oncogene mutants harbor the G12C mutation,
and G12D, G12V and other mutations do not provide an accessible cysteine nucleophile. In recent work with the
RAS GTPase Ral we showed through high-resolution structures and extensive biochemical studies that covalent
bond formation with Tyr-82 created a well-defined novel binding site located between the Switch II and the Switch
I/II pockets. Additional fragment screening carried out more recently identified a fragment that forms a covalent
bond at K-RAS Switch II Tyr-64 to inhibit activation of the GTPase by the Son-of-Sevenless (SOS) guanine
exchange factor. Here, we hypothesize that covalent bond formation with tyrosine or other amino acids on K-
RAS will inhibit activation or effector binding and block K-RAS signaling in cancer cells. Our preliminary data and
extensive experience in the field puts us in a strong position to accomplish our objectives. In Specific Aim 1, we
employ ligand- and structure-based methods to generate fragment electrophile libraries from large commercial
collections, and we follow a structure-based method to grow hit fragments into neighboring pockets to enhance
their binding affinity and reaction rates. In Specific Aim 2, we will carry out well-established intact protein mass
spectrometry, nucleotide exchange, and effector binding studies to screen fragment libraries for hit compounds,
and to characterize small molecules that emerge from fragment growing strategies. In Specific Aim 3, we will
use X-ray crystallography to solve the structure of hit fragments and derivatives that emerge from fragment
growing efforts. We also carry out cell biological studies to confirm direct engagement of K-RAS, inhibition of K-
RAS signaling, and inhibition of cancer cell proliferation. We expect to identify high quality fragments and small
molecules that form a covalent bond at wild-type and mutant K-RAS oncogenes, inhibit K-RAS wild-type or
oncogene mutant activity in cancer cell lines, and inhibit PDAC and lung adenocarcinoma cancer cell viability.
These compounds will serve as starting points to pursue in lead optimization efforts towards the development of
therapeutic agents for the treatment of K-RAS-driven tumors."
10653198,"SUMMARY ThGM Cells in CNS Autoimmunity
ThGM cells (ThGM-CSF) are a newly described Th subset characterized by production of GM-CSF, but
lacking expression of signature cytokines and master transcription factors (TF) for established Th cell
lineages. In our analysis, ThGM cells were notably more abundant than Th2 and Th17 cells in the blood of
healthy subjects, and even more so in MS patients. Although ThGM cells have some features of a distinct
lineage, further study is needed to clarify that distinction, as well as their roles in health and disease. ThGM cells
were highly encephalitogenic in the adoptive EAE model, and they can be readily found in the CNS of mice
with direct EAE. Importantly, ThGM cells were enriched in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients, who also
have greater numbers of circulating ThGM cells than healthy individuals. These findings suggest that ThGM
cells contribute to the pathogenesis of CNS autoimmunity, but this subject has been only minimally studied. Over
all, our data and published findings led us to hypothesize that ThGM cells play a significant pathogenic role
in autoimmune neuroinflammation, MS and EAE. We will test this hypothesis in the following specific aims:
Aim 1. To determine the origin of ThGM cells, and characterize the relationship between their GM-CSF
expression and phenotype. Both human and mouse ThGM cells can be readily differentiated directly from
naïve CD4+ T cells in vitro; however, it is unclear if ThGM cells in vivo originate from naïve precursors, or a
Th lineage that switched its phenotype. We hypothesize that ThGM cells in vivo develop directly from naïve
CD4+ T cells. In addition, we will study whether GM-CSF is a key determinant of ThGM cell phenotype, or
these cells have a unique overall phenotype irrespective of GM-CSF expression.
Aim 2. To study the role of ThGM cells in autoimmune neuroinflammation. Recent findings have
suggested that ThGM cells contribute to CNS autoimmunity, as they are overrepresented in MS patients’
PBMCs, and they induce EAE in mice by passive transfer. This led us to hypothesize that ThGM cells play
a significant pathogenic role in MS and EAE. In mice, we will characterize CNS autoimmunity induced by
ThGM cells, while in the human system we will test their pathogenicity in organotypic brain slices, and
characterize ThGM cells in MS brain lesions.
Aim 3. To determine the role of candidate TFs in shaping ThGM phenotype. ThGM cells do not express
master TFs of established Th lineages, suggesting that the ThGM phenotype is shaped by TF(s) differentially
expressed in ThGM cells. Our findings form the basis for the hypothesis that the ThGM phenotype is directed
by a set of TFs naturally overexpressed in ThGM cells compared to other Th cells. We will test this hypothesis
using mice lacking candidate TFs and by knocking down expression of candidate TFs in human CD4+ T cells.
Knowledge gained from these studies may modify the current concept of CNS autoimmunity."

Urine is an underappreciated source for systemic circulating tumor DNA in patients with non-genitourinary
cancers. Based on recent data suggesting that blood-based HPV DNA testing is useful for disease monitoring
in HPV positive oropharynx cancer patients, we identified non-metastatic HPV positive oropharyngeal cancer
patients as an excellent model system to examine the potential of urine-based transrenal DNA analysis. Our
preliminary data suggests that our newly developed urine-based HPV test could have biomarker performances
comparing favorably to blood-based HPV testing.
The specific objectives of this application are to establish that urine is a suitable source for HPV DNA in non-
metastatic HPV positive oropharynx cancer patients, and that at-home urine based molecular testing is feasible
for these patients. Specifically, we will compare sensitivity and specificity of pre-therapy urine-based HPV
testing to tissue gold standard testing in a cohort of newly diagnosed non-metastatic oropharyngeal cancer
patients. Recurrence detection lead time of urine-based HPV testing will be compared to clinical routine care in
the same cohort after curative intent treatment. Controls will include blood-based HPV testing, pharyngeal
swab-based HPV testing and blood based personalized ctDNA sequencing panel testing. Additional control
cohorts will include cervical and anal cancer patients as well as cancer-free patients with recently diagnosed
oncogenic HPV infections. Using in vivo fluorescence imaging techniques, we will generate fundamental
knowledge on renal handling of cell free DNA and determine the impact of chronic kidney disease and other
patient, disease and iatrogenic factors on cell free DNA excretion."
10862668,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Fibrosis is a common final outcome of most human chronic inflammatory diseases and has been estimated to
contribute to almost half of all deaths in the world 1. It can result from autoimmune diseases such as scleroderma,
after stem cell transplant in graft-vs-host disease, from chronic inflammatory conditions associated with obesity
and diabetes and through inherited genetic disorders. Fibrosis can affect virtually any organ including the skin,
lungs, kidneys, liver, heart and blood vessels. Scleroderma and graft-vs-host disease most commonly affect the
skin and the degree of skin involvement is associated with higher mortality and internal organ dysfunction 2,3,
suggesting common underlying mechanisms. We previously identified in these diseases activation of epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) on fibroblasts by its immune cell derived ligand epiregulin. This proposal aims to
further elucidate the major gaps in our knowledge of how EGFR signaling drives fibrosis in the skin. In particular,
it is unclear what signaling pathways downstream of EGFR activation are critical to different phases of fibrosis
and how these targets cross-talk with other fibrosis-associated pathways.
In this project, we examine the cellular signals that result from chronic EGFR activation in fibroblasts and
pericytes and their cross-talk with STAT1, an essential transcription factor for regulating interferon-dependent
gene expression. In our first aim, we will characterize the effects of EGFR activation in fibroblasts and pericytes
using a Tet-On expression system. This model system will allow temporal and cell-type control of EGFR
activation in vivo. We will analyze what EGFR pathways are activated and required for development of skin
fibrosis, and their effects on the immune system. In the second aim, we will examine the relevant cell types in
which STAT1 signaling is required for development of fibrosis using bone marrow chimeras and STAT1
conditional knockout mice. We will investigate whether EGFR and STAT1 signaling are co-dependent and utilize
proteomics techniques to discover protein interactions and modifications. Together, these aims will provide better
insight into the pathogenesis of fibrotic skin disease, lead to a broader understanding of fibrosis as a biological
process, and help develop new treatments that may substantially impact patients' lives."
10832065,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This exploratory proposal will be the first to characterize glycosylated RNAs in the context of human prostate
cancer (PCa). PCa is the most prevalent form of non-skin cancer in males and second leading cause of
cancer-related deaths among men. 20% of men diagnosed with PCa will progress to fast-growing, advanced
disease. There are no curative treatments for PCa that has spread to distant sites and the 5-year survival rate
for metastatic disease is only 30%. As high-grade PCa often leads to poor prognoses, it is imperative to better
understand these pathologies and improve patient stratification methods as well as therapeutic treatment
options to increase patient survival. Noncoding RNAs are widely misexpressed in PCa patients and act as key
tumor suppressor genes, pro-oncogenic factors in the prostate. Noncoding RNAs harbor a large range of post-
transcriptional modifications (m6A, inosine, pseudouridine, 2'-O-Me, A-to-I editing, 3’ uridine tailing) that are
important for RNA maturation, folding, expression, and nuclear transport. Dysregulation of these post-
transcriptional modifications are associated with tumor growth, invasion, angiogenesis, immune response and
disease recurrence. Noncoding RNAs were serendipitously discovered to carry glycosylation modifications
when cultured human and mouse cells were metabolically labeled using bioorthogonal chemistry methods
normally employed for glycosylated protein and lipid enrichment. Glycosylation is an intricate process that
typically involves the covalent attachment of carbohydrates onto proteins and lipids as the biomolecules move
through the secretory pathway. Aberrant protein/lipid glycosylation contributes to tumor growth, metastasis,
and immunosurveillance evasion and is being utilized as cancer biomarkers. We hypothesize that RNAs
require glycosylation for cell signaling to maintain prostate homeostasis and cancer prevention and therefore
the glycosylated state of RNA will correlate with prostate tumorgenicity. In support of this rationale, we
confirmed using click chemistry and northern blotting that glycoRNAs exist and with differing abundance in
human prostate cells. Specific Aims: This proposal will use two independent methods, metabolic labeling with
azide click chemistry and lectin-based purification, to classify glycoRNA distribution from a panel of human
prostate cell lines differing in their metastatic potential and hormone sensitivity. Aim 1 will unbiasedly determine
if small versus large noncoding RNAs are preferentially glycosylated in the prostate, if these glycoRNAs share
features for N- or O-linked sugars, and identify these species using RNAseq. In Aim 2, fractionation methods
and chemical inhibitor studies will determine the PCa-associated glycoRNA subcellular localization, possible
exosome enrichment and characterize these carbohydrate moieties via mass spectrometry. In Aim 3, the
Ptenpc-/- Smad4 pc-/- double knockout mouse model will be employed to characterize glycoRNAs from living
animals throughout a prostate cancer progression time course. This work will lead to novel insights into how
RNA modifications impact PCa progression and identify first-in-class clinical tools to improve patient outcome."
10877038,"Project Summary/Abstract
Mitral valve regurgitation (MR) is a growing public health concern, and with an aging population, its prevalence
is expected to rise steeply. For MR diagnosis and severity assessment, echocardiographic techniques have
long been the standard of care. Assessment based on such techniques, however, has limitations, both in terms
of technical challenges and treatment recommendations. As a result, optimal management of MR, especially
determining the timing of surgery, remains complex and stands to benefit from tools that provide quantitative
and comprehensive characterization of MR. The overall goal of this project is to develop and validate a stress
cardiovascular MRI protocol that can lead to a more definitive treatment plan for MR patients.
Cardiovascular MRI (CMR) is a well-established imaging technique that provides the most comprehensive
evaluation of the cardiovascular system. The reproducibility of CMR-based flow quantification has been shown
to be superior to that of echocardiography. Despite these advantages, the additive clinical value of CMR for
MR patients has not been established. More recently, evidence has emerged that CMR-based assessment has
better predictive power for clinical outcomes for MR patients and thus could play a central role in determining
management plans for such patients. Existing CMR techniques, however, have significant limitations,
precluding their use in routine clinical care. For example, the flow quantification using traditional 2D phase-
contrast MRI (PC-MRI) is sensitive to the placement of the imaging plane, cannot measure the transvalvular
flow directly, requires breath-holding, and is susceptible to irregular cardiac rhythm. Recently, 4D flow imaging,
due to its volumetric coverage and three-directional encoding, has gained significant interest, but acquisition
for 4D flow imaging using existing protocols can be prohibitively long, especially for whole-heart coverage.
Also, existing 4D flow imaging protocols only perform imaging under resting conditions, which cannot fully
characterize functional impairment that is only unmasked under stress testing.
In this work, we will develop and validate a comprehensive CMR protocol that (i) provides ferumoxytol-
enhanced 4D flow imaging with whole-heart coverage, (ii) requires minimal planning from the MRI technologist,
(iii) is performed in clinically feasible acquisition time, (iv) does not require breath-holds or regular cardiac
rhythm, (v) does not require navigator gating, (vi) allows imaging during exercise stress, exposing functional
impairment, and (vii) additionally provides cardiac function quantification to explain and interpret stress-induced
functional impairment observed in MR patients. In Aims 1 and 2, we will develop and optimize the protocol. In
Aims 3 and 4, we will validate the accuracy and reproducibility of the protocol in 55 healthy subjects and 55
patients diagnosed with MR. We hypothesize that the developed protocol leads to a more reliable assessment
of MR than possible with TTE alone and set the stage for larger clinical studies where the power of CMR
parameters to predict clinical outcomes is demonstrated."
10850346,"The mission of the National Resource for Aplysia at the University of Miami (the Resource) is to produce and
distribute consistently high-quality cultured sea hares, Aplysia californica, for biomedical research and
education and to improve the usefulness of this model system by applied research. Aplysia has played a vital
role in fundamental discoveries of how cellular and molecular changes in the nervous system underlie basic
behaviors, learning, and memory, due to unique characteristics of the simple nervous system that provide an
ideal model system for such studies. The 3 aims of the proposed continuation of this Resource program are:
 1. Animal Culture, Distribution and Health Monitoring – The Resource will continue to culture A.
californica and make all life stages, from eggs to large adults, available to researchers at a reasonable cost.
We anticipate sales will continue at a level of 8,000-10,000 animals per year. We will also accommodate
requests by users for separately reared cohorts, specialized diets, or harvesting of specific tissues for RNA or
DNA. We will monitor naturally occurring Aplysia abyssovirus (AAbV) in cohorts to better understand the
potential impacts of this virus and to provide information about virus levels to users. In addition, we will make
available additional specialized animals as developed in our Applied Research programs.
 2. Curation and Informatics – An improved system for management of stocks from egg laying throughout
the lifespan will be created and made publicly available through a web interface. The established website will
be enhanced to include additional content on uses of the Aplysia model system for human health research and
teaching. Our online ordering system will be improved. Training opportunities for graduate students,
undergraduate teaching labs, and public outreach activities using Aplysia will be expanded and enhanced.
 3. Applied Research – We will conduct two applied research projects that will expand the usefulness of this
model system. 3.1 Developing Aplysia as a model of enhanced susceptibility of the aged to cerebral
ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) – Aplysia is hypoxia-resistant, and likely has adaptations to resist IRI. Markers
of IRI, such as variations in mitochondrial function, will be studied in abdominal ganglia exposed to ischemia
and ischemia plus reperfusion. We will also examine the impact of age and pre-exposure to hypoxia on IRI.
Developing this model may allow users to investigate the impacts of IRI on neural excitability and may lead to
novel avenues of research and innovation in therapies. 3.2 Developing Aplysia as a model to study enhanced
susceptibility of the aged to myocardial IRI – Impacts of IRI on cardiac function as well as other IRI markers will
be studied. As above, the impact of age and pre-exposure to hypoxia on IRI will be investigated. This aim will
begin to pinpoint what adaptations Aplysia heart employs to mitigate hypoxic damage, and if those adaptations
persist as an organism ages. Developing Aplysia as a cardiac model will potentially expand this model
organism to uses beyond the nervous system."
10893992,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed the treatment of melanoma, significantly
enhancing overall survival. The exponential increase in their use after being approved for melanoma in the adjuvant setting
is significantly changing the lanscape of cancer survivorship. Inspite of the survival benefits, the use of ICI can be limited
by off-target inflammatory responses and autoimmunity in various organs. The clinical phenotypes of the acute immune
toxicities have been clearly documented in trials. Yet, their potential long-term adverse effects, and their impact quality of
life (QOL) are still undetermined. The overall goal of the proposed study is to understand the full impact of adjuvant ICI
therapy, including its potential toxicity/symptom burden and its immune correlates in melanoma patients receiving regular
clinical care. We hypothesize that: adverse events and sustained inflammation induced by adjuvant ICIs increase symptom
burden and negatively impact function and QOL in a subset of melanoma patients receiving therapy, and that elevated
expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and T-cell signatures during therapy correlate with the toxicity and symptom
burden. We will test this hypothesis in a prospective cohort of 240 melanoma patients from the initiation of adjuvant ICI
therapy through 2 years of follow-up. We will determine the incidence, clinical phenotypes, timing, and severity of irAEs,
and will longitudinally assess patients reported outcomes through 2 years of follow-up. We will use validated instruments
and ecological momentary assessments technology to assess adverse events and symptom burden in real time via patient-
initiated reports. Lastly, we will characterize patient immune signatures (immune cell phenotypes and inflammatory
cytokines) from baseline through 2 years of follow-up and evaluate their association with irAEs and symptom burden.

10834209,"PROJCT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Inconsistent findings regarding whether and how E-cigarette (EC) use influences subsequent tobacco use
behaviors complicate evidence-based tobacco regulation. Among youth, EC use is associated with greater risk
of transitioning to combustible cigarette (CC) smoking, but estimated effect sizes of EC exposure vary
substantially across studies. Among adults who currently smoke CCs, ECs show potential to help quit CC
smoking in some studies but not in others. These inconsistent findings may be due in part to a preponderance
of observational studies, use of small size cross-sectional data, and inadequate control for covariates, Further,
despite considerable heterogeneity in the size of estimated EC exposure effects, whether specific
characteristics modify the EC exposure effects has been largely ignored in literature. Understanding how ECs
influence subsequent CC smoking, particularly among vulnerable subgroups (e.g., age, gender), and their
intersectionality, will help inform regulatory activities that address tobacco-related health disparities. Lastly, it is
unclear whether estimated EC exposure effects from a certain population subgroup or at a certain time can be
generalized to different subgroups or times. Generalizable EC exposure effects could provide critical evidence
for tobacco regulators. To address these knowledge gaps, this study aims to use causal machine learning
methods to determine the influence of ECs on subsequent CC smoking, in overall US youth and adult
populations and in vulnerable subgroups, and to explore methods for estimating generalizable EC exposure
effects. A secondary analysis of the longitudinal Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health study will be
conducted to address the following specific aims. Aim 1: Determine average exposure effects of EC use on
subsequent CC smoking in youth and adults. Aim 2: Determine heterogeneous EC exposure effects among
vulnerable subgroups (age, gender, poverty, race/ethnicity). Aim 3: Evaluate the performance of causal
machine learning methods to generalize EC exposure effects using both simulated and PATH Study data. To
successfully accomplish these aims and develop into an independent methodologist in tobacco regulator
science (TRS), I will obtain training in the following areas: 1) TRS theories and measures, especially health
disparities in TRS; 2) Causal inference methods for evaluating exposure effects; and 3) Machine learning skills
for high-dimensional data analysis. During the award period, I will be supported in my research and training
goals by my institution and interdisciplinary mentoring team, which consists of experts in the fields of TRS,
causal inference, machine learning, and health disparities. The K01 research and training experience will result
in an R01 with the overarching goal of extending causal machine learning methods for generalization to
address more complex real-world questions. In the long term, I will bring TRS, machine learning methods,
and causal inference together to address pressing issues in TRS. This effort will put causal machine learning
methods in the hands of tobacco researchers and facilitate the use of complex data to inform FDA regulations."
10838525,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune, neurodegenerative disease with inflammation, demyelination,
axonal damage, glial activation and synaptic loss. There are relapses and permanent disabilities. Despite
success of treatments targeting cells in the immune system, there is an unmet need for treatments targeting cells
in central nervous system (CNS) to repair disabilities. Four observations provide rationale for a new approach to
neurodegeneration in MS: 1) MS patients are heterogenous in their disabilities, and distinct disabilities (walking,
vision, cognition, coordination) are served by different CNS regions, 2) Even in healthy brain, a given CNS cell
type differs in gene expression from one brain region to another, 3) Being female versus male impacts disability
worsening, and 4) Aging aligns with disability progression. Here, we will use a cell-specific, region-specific, and
sex-specific approach to discover optimal treatment targets for distinct disabilities in MS women and men.
 Bedside to Bench to Bedside in MS: Clinical observations of sex differences are investigated at the
preclinical level then translated back to the clinic as trials designed for each sex. Preclinical use of female and
male mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) entails in vivo MRI for region-specific
atrophy, neuropathology of each region, RNA-sequencing of distinct CNS cells in each region,
immunohistochemistry validation of top genes in highly differentially expressed pathways, cell-specific
conditional knockout (CKO) of target genes to reverse phenotype, and knockdown of target genes with
pharmacologic treatment to reverse phenotype. The effect of genetic (CKO vs WT) and/or pharmacologic
(treatment vs placebo) interventions on reversal of gene expression is determined in each sex. Human MS data
guide preclinical research at three checkpoints: i) MRI in females and males with MS revealing sex differences
in substructure atrophy prioritize regions in EAE with atrophy, ii) Single nuclei RNA-seq analyses in females and
males with MS revealing gene pathways of interest prioritize gene pathways in EAE, iii) immunohistochemistry
in females and males using MS postmortem tissues validate immunohistochemistry in EAE. Substitution of use
of female versus male mice (as above) with use of gonadectomized versus gonadally intact mice will reveal
activational effects of sex hormones. Use of Four Core Genotype mice will reveal sex chromosome effects versus
developmental hormone effects. Use of young versus old mice will reveal the effect of aging.
 This R35 proposal will: 1) Extend our cell-specific and region-specific transcriptomics in astrocytes
and oligodendrocytes to microglia and neurons, with cell:cell interactions revealed in mice double-labelled to
show gene expression changes in two distinct cell types in the same region in the same mouse, and 2) Determine
if there are effects of sex and/or age on the most differentially expressed cell-specific and region-specific
pathways. In summary, this R35 proposal takes our research to the next level: Identifying sex by age interactions
in cell-specific and region-specific transcriptomics, neuropathology, and substructure atrophy on MRI."
11064972,"Abstract
Radiofrequency (RF) ablation of ventricular tachycardia (VT) in ischemic cardiomyopathy is fraught with
limitations due to suboptimal efficacy, risk of complications, and frequent need for repeat procedures. Ischemic
VT arises as a result of reentrant circuits within or around the myocardial scar of an infarct. The co-localization
of ventricular arteries, veins, and nerves, is an anatomical fact, determined by the embryology of coronary
vessels. Just as myocardial infarctions have a “culprit” or “infarct-related artery”, there commonly exists an
“infarct-related vein” or veins in VT substrate. Additionally, it is well known that autonomic innervation -in
anatomical proximity to the veins- plays an important role in post-MI arrhythmogenesis. We have developed an
approach to target ablation-refractory VTs via ethanol delivery in the coronary veins that provide venous return
from arrhythmogenic sites (venous ethanol, VE). Beyond an initial set of case reports, we have validated the
utility of VE in a large, multinational registry, in which we establish the safety and efficacy of VE in RF-refractory
VT. Given the co-localization of epicardial arteries, veins and nerves, VE may be particularly suited to impact
infarct innervation. Thus, a central goal of this proposal is to capitalize on the presence of coronary veins on the
epicardial aspect of a myocardial scar as a therapeutic opportunity of unique mechanisms. We hypothesize that
VE added to conventional catheter ablation improves the results of VT ablation. We propose a single-site,
investigator-initiated clinical trial on VE.
In Aim 1-R61 phase-, we propose to finalize the design of randomized clinical trial to assess the clinical efficacy,
and safety of VE when used in combination with RF ablation compared with RF ablation alone -Venous Ethanol
for Left Ventricular Ischemic VEntricular Tachycardia -VELVET clinical trial. The trial will include an
investigational new drug (IND) authorization by the FDA. Patients with ischemic VT will be randomized to
conventional endocardial ablation alone, vs combined with VE in the infarct-related vein.
In Aim 2 -R33 phase- we will enroll a total of 156 patients, and collect efficacy, safety and procedural data on
the impact of VE added to catheter ablation. This trial will allow for a wealth of new imaging data to be collected
that will characterize the extent of myocardial scar and innervation before and after VE -compared to endocardial
RF alone. In Aim 3 -R33 phase- we will collect multi-modality imaging data characterizing the VT substrate before
and after ablation -with catheter ablation alone vs combined with VE. Cardiac magnetic resonance, venous CT
angiograms and regional adrenergic innervation maps with positron emission tomography (PET) scans of
innervation tracers (11C hydroxyephedrine, 11C-HED) will provide a complete structural assessment of the VT
substrate, before and after ablation.
If completed, the project will validate a new procedural strategy and will provide key new insights into the
structural determinants of VT ablation success."

The proposed experiments will provide a clearer picture of the mechanisms that shape
responses to natural stimuli in the primate retina. Preliminary results suggest several important
insights. Aim 1: We find that standard models fail to account for responses of On parasol cells to
natural images. These are among the best-studied ganglion cells, and the inability of standard
models to account for their responses is surprising. Specifically, our results suggest that the
manner in which these cells integrate signals across space is highly stimulus-dependent in a
manner not captured by current models. Aim 2: We find that receptive field subunits - long
associated with bipolar cells - have more diverse properties than previously appreciated, likely
reflecting contributions of cells other than bipolar cells. In particular, light-dependent changes in
subunit size will be important to consider in evaluating the functional role of subunits. Aim 3: A
tool that we recently developed reveals significant contributions of post-photoreceptor
mechanisms to the kinetics of retinal ganglion cell responses."
10892883,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 While lung transplant is a lifesaving surgery for patients with fatal lung diseases, there remains a critical
limitation as median post-transplant survival is merely 5.5 years which is only half the survival experienced by
other organ transplant types. Unfortunately, this low survival is from the accelerated deterioration in lung
function in the years after transplant and cannot be fully explained by transplant center practices, donor
factors, or recipient factors. Troublingly, there is also disparate survival by geography which varies up to 39%
depending on the region of the U.S. We hypothesize that place, defined as a social and environmental location
with meaning to a person, impacts recipient health and in a mechanistic hypothesis these place-based factors
cause subclinical micro-injuries to the lungs which accelerate lung function loss in the years after transplant.
There is a gap in knowledge on how place-based factors exacerbate both the geographically disparate and
poor survival of lung transplant recipients. In the absence of this knowledge, it is difficult to precisely risk
stratify recipients and develop patient and policy level interventions. To address this gap, we leverage the
Geographic Information Sciences, defined as the framework to measure, map, and model the effects of place.
The scope of Aim 1 is to inform clinical decisions by geocoding a multicenter cohort to identify individual
recipient level census tracts. This enables linkage to highly granular federal datasets with a wide array of social
and environmental health measures followed by the application of multilevel models and established spatial
cluster detection methods. This is significant as these results would enable us to pivot away from an existing
one-size-fits-all clinical approach by screening earlier for worsening lung function or tailoring
immunosuppression medications to prevent lung function loss for at risk patients. The scope of Aim 2 is to
inform policy through mapping disparities across the U.S. and improving the accuracy of established clinical
prediction models. We will merge the singular national transplant registry with highly valued federal data
measuring social and environmental health factors, and test the inclusion of place-based factors on the
performance of novel multilevel models and established clinical cox models. New maps and more accurate
models would be a significant advance towards identifying and reducing geographic disparities and improving
outcomes through targeted resource allocation. Our long-term goal is to improve the suboptimal lung transplant
survival and ensure this improvement is achieved regardless of place. This project is impactful as we are the
first in lung transplant to look beyond the walls of our hospitals to create unprecedented comprehensive data
translatable towards patient and policy level interventions. This proposal is responsive to the Final Rule
mandate by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that patient geography should have a minimal
role in transplant outcomes, a mandate the field of transplantation has made little progress towards over the
past two decades due, in large part, to gaps in knowledge that our proposal aims to fill."
10809736,"ABSTRACT
Endothelial injury occurring during bacterial and viral infections results in uncontrolled accumulation of protein-
rich fluid and inflammatory cells in the underlying tissue, hallmarks of acute lung injury (ALI), and acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Despite remarkable advances in supportive care, patient survival in the
setting of ALI and ARDS remains near 40%. We have demonstrated a crucial role of transient receptor potential
channel 6 (TRPC6) mediated Ca2+ entry in initiating inflammatory signaling that causes ALI. However, we also
showed that mutation of isoleucine (I)111 for its isomer leucine (L)111 in TRPC6 or block of TRPC6 at
isoleucine111 using a novel peptide allows the channel to gain new functions independent of Ca2+ entry for
programming EC from inflammatory into the regenerative lineage, thereby resolving lung injury. Thus,
understanding the mechanisms of action of I111 in inducing channel activity and the therapeutic value of blocking
I111 to promote EC regeneration hold the key to preventing these diseases. We show that: 1) substitution of I111
for its isomer L111 in the Ist ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) of TRPC6 blocks Ca2+ entry; 2) I111L mutation initiates
allosteric transitions in TRPC6 leading to loss of channel function, based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
studies; 3) I111L-TRPC6 induces EC regenerative signaling during injury as evidenced by expression of ERG, a
transcription factor maintaining EC homeostasis, and EC proliferation, leading to rapid lung repair after injury; 4)
rescue of WT-TRPC6 but not the I111L-TRPC6 mutant in EC of Trpc6-/- mice reinstates LPS-induced lung vascular
hyperpermeability by suppressing the expression of ERG but augmenting NFB-expression and inflammatory
signaling; 5) inducing conditional deletion of ERG in EC impaired EC proliferation and induced lung injury, and,
6) a TRPC6 blocking peptide spanning I111-TRPC6 suppresses Ca2+ entry in EC but promotes EC proliferation
and resolution of lung inflammatory injury. Epigenetic changes in chromatin accessibility enable signal-
dependent activation of transcription factors that bind gene promoters and enhancers to dictate cell functions.
Intriguingly, ATAC-seq and Chip-seq of EC sorted from control versus injured lungs suggest that WT or mutated
channel selectively activates the EC epigenome either in favor of NFB or ERG transcriptional activities to switch
EC phenotype, thereby dictating the outcome of lung injury. Based on these exciting findings, in Aim#1, we will
determine the novel mechanisms induced by isoleucine111 in regulating TRPC6 structural organization and
functions. In Aim#2, we will test the hypothesis that in contrast to WT-TRPC6, the I111L TRPC6 mutant gains
new functions independent of channel activity to program the EC epigenome to adopt a regenerative lineage
and therapeutically blocking this residue function will therefore repair the vascular injury in the pre-clinical models
of lung injury. Studies will use multipronged approaches, including molecular modeling, multi-omics, and 2-
photon imaging of lung EC, along with an I111-TRPC6 blocking peptide to accomplish these aims. We believe
these studies to be translational for developing specific TRPC6 antagonists to prevent ARDS."
10760302,"PROPOSAL SUMMARY
Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules present peptides at the cell surface to CD8 T cells.
The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) is a heterodimeric molecule of TAP1 and TAP2 that
lies at the center of a macromolecular peptide loading complex tasked with loading and folding MHC-I molecules
with peptides. TAP shuttles cytosolic proteasome-generated peptides across the membrane of the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) for luminal delivery and loading of MHC-I molecules. Given the crucial role of TAP in translocating
peptides to MHC-I molecules, many clinically important human viruses such as Herpesviridae and Poxviridae
have evolved strategies to block TAP and evade host CD8 T cell recognition. TAP blockade upon infection of
dendritic cells (DC), which are responsible for naïve CD8 T cell priming, impairs conventional TAP-proteasome
processing for the classic MHC-I presentation of peptides to CD8 T cells. In fact, the current paradigm holds that
TAP blockade in DC renders these cells non-functional and incapable of priming a CD8 T cell response. Priming
virus-specific CD8 T cells falls on uninfected TAP-sufficient bystander DC through cross-presentation, a process
that enables MHC-I loading with viral peptides derived from DC internalized virus-infected dying cells. However,
CD8 T cells primed by TAP-sufficient DC recognize dominant TAP-dependent peptides, whose presentation is
severely reduced on tissues infected with immune evasive viruses. TAP-dependent CD8 T cells would also be
mismatched to the TAP-independent peptides liberated by alternative TAP-independent processing of viral
antigens and presented by MHC-I on those infected tissues. Either scenario creates a diminished or mismatched
CD8 T cell target. How does the immune system get around this problem? We found that DC without functional
TAP rely on cell-autonomous delivery of MHC-I from a new location, the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment
(ERGIC), to internalized antigens to rescue MHC-I presentation and nevertheless cross-prime CD8 T cells. We
call this pathway non-canonical cross-presentation. Our findings point to non-canonical cross-presentation as a
previously unrecognized pathway for priming CD8 T cells that recognize TAP-independent epitopes and would
be best-matched against immune evasive viruses. Studying non-canonical cross-presentation is important to
understand the full spectrum of CD8 T cells that can be mobilized against infection, especially if such T cells
provide potent local cross-protection within infected tissues. We seek to understand the role of non-canonical
cross-presentation in priming a TAP-independent CD8 T cell response against viral infection. Using novel models,
we will identify DC that conduct non-canonical cross-presentation, and define the repertoire of TAP-independent
epitopes they present to antigen-specific TAP-independent CD8 T cells. We will create novel tools to track TAP-
independent CD8 T cell responses and determine whether non-canonical cross-presentation can drive cross-
protective immunity against viral variants and immune evasive viruses. Understanding non-canonical cross-
presentation will inform universal vaccine design and new therapies for chronic and persistent viral infections."
10893337,"Identifying risk factors for cognitive change early in the natural history of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is critical, as
there is yet no cure for the disease. The lifetime risk of AD is higher in women than men, yet few studies have
identified female-related risk factors for the disease. The menopause is a universal event in women and affects
cognitive and brain health. In addition to hormonal changes, the menopause is accompanied by vasomotor
symptoms (VMS) and sleep problems. Over 70% of midlife women report VMS, and for a third of women, VMS
are persistent for over a decade, well into the 60s. Further, half of women report poor sleep at menopause.
Few studies have examined the effect of VMS on brain health, particularly during sleep (sleep VMS). Informed
by our novel pilot work showing links of sleep VMS to brain health and the growing understanding of the
negative effect of poor sleep on brain health and AD pathology, the MsBrain I study focused on VMS and sleep
disturbance, persistent symptoms tied to risk factors for AD including cardiovascular disease (CVD). Our initial
MsBrain I findings indicate that objectively-assessed sleep VMS (measured with state-of-the-art ambulatory
monitors) as well as poor sleep (measured with actigraphy) are associated with worse cognitive function and
adverse indicators of brain structure and function. Sex steroid hormones do not explain these associations. In
MsBrain II, we propose to test VMS and poor sleep as risk factors for adverse changes in brain and cognitive
health among 160 MsBrain I participants (current mean age=60 years). Our primary aim is to leverage a
longitudinal design to test whether a greater burden of objectively-assessed menopausal symptoms (sleep
VMS, poor sleep) assessed up to three times over ten years is associated with declines brain and cognitive
health over time. We will test the role of estrogens and CVD risk in the relationships of sleep VMS and sleep to
brain and cognitive health. This aim recognizes the complex interplay among risk factors for cognitive
impairment, with a focus on factors that change with menopause. Further, a wealth of basic science shows
menopause-induced changes in mitochondrial function that contribute to adverse brain changes. Our pilot data
finds VMS and sleep related to altered mitochondrial function. Our third aim tests the relations of mitochondrial
function to brain health and the role of mitochondrial function in links between VMS, sleep, and brain health. To
achieve these aims, we will invite 160 MsBrain I participants back to repeat objective assessments of VMS and
sleep, as well as CVD risk factor assessment, carotid ultrasound imaging, sex hormone measurement, blood-
based measures of mitochondrial function, and neuropsychological testing. To advance this science, we will
extend our brain imaging work to leverage state-of-the-art 7 Tesla (7T) magnetic resonance imaging to assess
brain structure and function. Findings from this study will determine whether VMS and poor sleep can be
identified as markers for midlife women at risk of cognitive decline. The ultimate goal of this work is to assist in
early intervention efforts to improve cognition, enhance brain reserve, and reduce AD risk in aging women."
10916465,"Abstract
Overweight and obesity are among the most prevalent and pressing health issues affecting Latino men, with
rates of overweight and obesity among Latino men being 42% and 37%, respectively22. Within this group,
Puerto Rican (PR) men are at especially high risk. In the Hispanic Community Health Study/ Study of Latinos,
the highest rates of obesity were observed among PR men (40.9%)22, and PR men had a high prevalence of
type 2 diabetes (16.2%) and hypercholesterolemia (48.2%)22. Thus, there is an urgent need to address
obesity-related behaviors- such as diet and physical inactivity- in Puerto Rican men. Moreover, developing
culturally tailored obesity interventions that target diet, physical activity and sedentary behavior in Puerto
Ricans has the potential to address a critical public health need and provides a foundation for tailoring and
disseminating future interventions to other cultures. This study has the active support of the Hispanic/Latino
Health Community Advisory Board, the Puerto Rican Cultural Center, The Puerto Rican Agenda, additional
Puerto Rican-centered and Latino organizations and individuals, the RUSH-BMO Institute for Health Equity,
and the NIH-funded University of Chicago- Rush Institute for Translational Medicine. Although telehealth has
been used to increase reach in weight loss interventions with hard-to-reach populations26, 27, few have focused
on men or ethnic minorities8. Moreover, there are no published telehealth weight loss interventions focusing on
healthy eating, physical activity, and sedentary behaviors, specifically targeting Puerto Rican men who are at
high risk for obesity. We therefore propose a proof-of-concept study to determine if a telehealth intervention,
tailored to target Puerto Rican men of varying levels of acculturation, is feasible and acceptable, and if it can
achieve clinically meaningful weight loss. The “TeleSalud Healthy Eating, Physical Activity, and Sedentary
Behavior Intervention” (TeleSalud HE-PA/SB) will consist of 4 months of twice-weekly classes on increasing
healthy eating and physical activity and decreasing sedentary behavior, followed by a 4-month maintenance
healthy eating, physical activity, and sedentary behavior intervention. This intervention will be compared to the
“TeleSalud General Health” intervention, consisting of 4 months of twice weekly telehealth classes on general
health issues, followed by a 4-month general health intervention. We will examine feasibility, acceptability, and
intermediate process measures for diet (energy intake, percent calories from saturated fat, fruit & vegetable
intake via the Block Food Frequency Questionnaire); physical activity/ sedentary behavior (metabolic
equivalent of task (MET)-minutes/week and minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity [MVPA] via the
International Physical Activity Questionnaire and accelerometer-assisted minutes of MVPA); and social
cognitive theory concepts (self-efficacy, outcome expectations, social support for eating & exercise) which are
guiding the intervention. The final aim is to examine trends based on differences in level of acculturation."
10915460,"Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and airway inflammation are hallmarks of asthma. Refractory asthma
manifests with persistent symptoms despite use of high-dose oral corticosteroids and long-acting β2-agonist
bronchodilators and poses a major healthcare challenge. Understanding the mechanisms and developing
strategies to overcome therapeutic resistance poses a significant unmet need. Airway smooth muscle (ASM)
hypercontraction is a key factor of AHR, and T-helper 17 (Th17) cells promote steroid-insensitive neutrophilic
airway inflammation (NAI). We found p63RhoGEF, a RhoA activator, plays crucial roles in refractory asthma.
We also developed CXN-8, a small molecule inhibitor of p63RhoGEF. Objective: To determine the importance
and mechanisms by which p63RhoGEF modulates the asthma diathesis and if CXN-8 inhibits p63RhoGEF to
ameliorate AHR and NAI. Long-term goal: To develop new therapies for refractory asthma. Findings: 1) p63-
RhoGEF is selectively upregulated in asthmatics and plays a critical role in RhoA activation that controls ASM
hypercontraction and Th17 cell differentiation. 2) CXN-8 inhibits ASM contraction and induces relaxation of
airway. 3) CXN-8 ameliorates AHR and NAI in murine asthma models. 4) CXN-8 interacts with p63RhoGEF to
block RhoA activation. Hypothesis: Targeting p63RhoGEF-stimulated ASM hypercontractility and Th17 cell
differentiation with CXN-8 ameliorates AHR and NAI and that CXN-8 therapy represents a novel strategy for
refractory asthma. We will test this hypothesis in vitro and in vivo. Aim 1. To define the mechanism underlying
p63RhoGEF and CXN-8 regulation of AHR. We will use RNAi and inhibitors to determine the pivotal role and
mechanism of p63RhoGEF in hypercontractility of asthmatic human ASM (HASM) cells. We will analyze CXN-
8 regulation of RhoA activity, Ca2+ signaling, contraction/relaxation of β2-agonist-sensitive/insensitive HASM
cells. We will combine RNAi, mutagenesis, and surface plasmon resonance to elucidate the specificity and
mechanism for CXN-8 regulation of p63RhoGEF. Whether p63RhoGEF loss ameliorates AHR and reduces the
effects of CXN-8 will be examined in a house dust mite (HDM)-driven murine model of asthma. Aim 2. To
elucidate the mechanism underlying p63RhoGEF and CXN-8 regulation of NAI. We will examine the effects of
CXN-8 on Th17 cell differentiation. We will silence RhoA or express an active RhoA mutant to establish its
importance in CXN-8 inhibition of Th17 cell differentiation. We will also determine if loss of p63RhoGEF
attenuates RhoA activation and Th17 differentiation in cells and HDM-induced NAI in mice and reduces CXN-8
inhibitory effects in vitro and in vivo. Aim 3. To examine the therapeutic potential of CXN-8 in murine models of
refractory asthma. We will determine if inhaled CXN-8 is an acute and effective bronchodilator in a murine
model of β2-agonist insensitive AHR. We will test lung targeted, long-acting CXN-8 microparticles to alleviate
AHR/NAI with limited systemic side-effects in a murine model of corticosteroid-insensitive asthma. The impact
of p63RhoGEF loss on AHR/NAI and therapeutic effects of CXN-8 will also be examined in these studies."

Iron and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent (Fe/2OG) enzymes, representing a superfamily of non-heme mononuclear
iron-containing (NHM-Fe) enzymes, have garnered strong research interests from fundamental enzyme
mechanism studies to bioengineering/biocatalysis explorations in recent years due to their exceedingly diverse
catalytic reactivities and simple enzyme architectures. Radical halogenation reactions via C-H bond activation
catalyzed by Fe/2OG halogenases are particularly attractive for chemical synthesis and biocatalysis applications,
since these enzymes can install carbon-halide bonds in a regio- and stereo-specific manner, a feat that has yet
to be achieved by organic synthetic methodology. As revealed by the mechanistic studies of carrier protein-
dependent Fe/2OG halogenases, the key step in the radical halogenation mechanism is the selective halide
radical transfer from the hydroxo-Fe(III)-halide intermediate to the substrate radical generated by the key reactive
species, the ferryl (Fe(IV)=O) intermediate. However, a consensus mechanism to explain the selective halide
transfer in Fe/2OG halogenases has not been reached, particularly the controlling factors to avoid hydroxyl
radical transfer to lead to hydroxylation reaction are not fully revealed. Additionally, the reasons why Fe/2OG
enzymes cannot perform fluorination reaction are completely unknown. In this project, we will bridge these
knowledge gaps by studying two newly discovered carrier protein-independent Fe/2OG halogenases that
catalyze chlorination reactions to generate halogenated nucleotide natural products and halogenated free-
standing amino acids. By using an integrative approach consisting of mechanistic probe design and synthesis,
enzyme product structural determination via LC-MS and NMR analysis, transient enzyme kinetics, advanced
spectroscopic characterization and molecular dynamics simulations, we will elucidate the influence of protein-
substrate interactions and dynamics in controlling efficient halogenation, explore the effect of different iron-bound
anions (e.g. Cl- vs. F-) to the electronic structure and the reactivity of the ferryl intermediate, test new chemical
strategies to enable fluorination in Fe/2OG enzymes, and expand the substrate scope of these enzymes for
potential synthetic applications. Given the importance of halogen-containing organic molecules in the modern
pharmaceutical and agrochemical applications, mechanistic elucidation of these newly discovered halogenases
will lay scientific foundation for future biocatalytic applications of these unique enzymes."
10873214,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Among the 7 million stroke survivors living in the U.S., fewer than 10% have adequate walking speed and
endurance to complete normal daily activities like grocery shopping, which leads to a loss of life roles. Stroke
rehabilitation guidelines recommend moderate-intensity aerobic training (MAT) via walking exercise to address
this limitation in walking capacity. However, recent evidence suggests that MAT may have negligible effects
among many people in the chronic phase of stroke (>6 months post stroke), especially those with severe gait
impairment (speed <0.4 m/s). There is growing belief that a more vigorous training intensity (>60% heart rate
reserve vs 40-60%) may be critical for eliciting greater improvements in walking capacity. Yet, the optimal
training intensity has been difficult to determine among stroke survivors because neurologic impairments make
it challenging to reach vigorous intensity. This study will use a novel training protocol to overcome this
limitation. Based on the well-tested exercise science and cardiac rehabilitation strategy of high-intensity
interval training (HIT), this protocol uses bursts of maximum speed walking alternating with recovery periods, to
sustain higher intensities than physiologically possible with continuous exercise and with less perceived
exertion. Preliminary results suggest that this innovative locomotor HIT protocol may improve walking capacity
and other outcomes significantly more than MAT, and that it could be uniquely effective among patients with
severe gait impairment, a subgroup that has not yet shown meaningful responses to MAT or other
interventions. However, no previous studies have been large enough to test whether a more vigorous training
program like HIT increases benefit more than risk, yields sustained gains in walking capacity beyond the end of
training or elicits significantly greater improvement than moderate-intensity training among patients with severe
gait impairment. In this study, 156 people at least 6 months post-stroke at 3 research sites across the U.S. will
be randomized to perform either a HIT or MAT program, each involving 45 minutes of walking exercise with a
physical therapist, 3 times per week for 12 weeks. Walking function, fatigue, aerobic capacity, and quality of life
will be assessed by blinded raters at baseline, after 4, 8 and 12 weeks of training and 3 months after training
ends, while safety will be monitored throughout. The primary statistical analysis will then determine which
training intensity is better (vigorous or moderate) for safely producing meaningful and sustained improvements
in walking capacity in chronic stroke. A second analysis will also assess whether vigorous training intensity is
particularly critical for patients with severe gait impairment. At study completion, we expect to have gained
foundational knowledge about how to select training intensity to maximize recovery of walking function after
stroke. This new knowledge will likely lead to better outcomes in future studies and clinical rehabilitation, thus
making a positive impact on the disability burden of stroke."
10817078,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
On average, a man dies from PCa every 16 minutes, mainly due to development of secondary malignant
growths outside of the primary cancer site, known as metastases. The cornerstone of PCa treatment is
androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). ADT temporarily halts PCa, but leads to resistance in nearly all cases,
resulting in castration-resistant PC (CRPC). CRPC then undergoes further evolution of metastatic subclones
and results in incurable disease. Research techniques revealing resistance mechanisms and clonal evolution
of metastatic PCa are lacking due to the limited capacity of current animal models to mimic PCa evolution in its
native microenvironment as well as inefﬁcient methods for tracing subclonal evolution.
Therefore, we developed EvoCaP (!Evolution in Cancer of the Prostate”), a mouse model of endogenous
metastasis that recapitulates human PCa genetically, by using PTEN/TP53 co-deletions enriched in metastatic
patients, and phenotypically, by focal initiation of primary disease progressing to bones, lungs, lymph nodes
and liver metastases. Our model uses a lentiviral platform - LV.CreBC10 carrying: (1) Cre (Pten/Trp53 co-
deletions; activation of Cas9, ﬂuorescence and luminescence markers); (2) Barcode with ten sites for marking
by Cas9 (BC10); (3) RNA guide speciﬁcally marking BC10; and (4) guide or short hairpin RNA for testing
metastatic drivers. Luminescence (FLuc) permits continuous tracking of disease progression and ﬂuorescence
(eGFP) allows for speciﬁc sorting of cancer cells. BC10 represents a synthetic array of on-target sites, in order
of decreasing activity, for the RNA guide that attracts Cas9 to generate subsequently speciﬁc edits. To
streamline barcode analysis, we have established an R package - EvoTraceR. This comprehensive system
enables: (1) the proﬁling of cancer cells based on shared mutational patterns in primary and metastasis; and
(2) the building of phylogenetic trees to track evolution toward metastases in a robust and ﬂexible way.
Our central hypothesis is that differences in distinct molecular and phenotypical clonal architectures will be
precisely detected between primary and metastatic sites depending on therapy status, enabling the inhibition of
metastasis and/or resistance promoting genes and pathways. Our analyses will establish and mechanistically
validate drivers of metastatic clonal expansion caused by Pten/Tp53-loss (basal) and also investigate how
evolutionary pressure from therapy (ADT), applied at different stages of PCa, leads to the emergence of
resistant clones. We will then use Cas9/guide (g)RNA and inducible short hairpins to target genes altered in
those expanding clones to identify drivers of both treatment-naive and treatment-induced PCa metastasis.
EvoCaP can feasibly track molecular evolution and validate targets for drug development, which may lead to
identiﬁcation of novel metastatic driver genes and pathways. Thus, therapies could be applied in: (1) primary
diseases for early detection and interruption of metastases development; and (2) already existing metastases.
Importantly, technologies developed in this project can also be applied to other types of metastatic cancers."

Stroke and other neurodegenerative disorders are a leading cause of death, disability, and loss of quality of
life. The importance of glutamate neurotoxicity in cerebral ischemia and neurodegenerative diseases is well
documented. Both in vitro and in vivo administration of glutamate and its analogs effectively kill neurons via
excitotoxic mechanisms. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is pivotal in glutamate neurotoxicity and
cerebral infarction. Prior studies indicate that NO, or peroxynitrite plays a prominent role in glutamate
excitotoxicity and cerebral infarction. Amongst other responses NO, or peroxynitrite, can activate PARP-1,
which leads to cell death through the formation of complex and branched poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymer.
Apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) has been identified as key mediator of neurotoxicity triggered by glutamate,
reactive oxygen species, DNA damage and PAR polymer. AIF resides in the mitochondria in normal healthy
cells but moves to the nucleus following a lethal stimulus in a PARP-1 dependent manner. Blocking AIF from
entering the nucleus can spare cells from death. This form of cell death has recently been designated
parthanatos to distinguish it from other types of cell death such as apoptosis, necroptosis or autophagic
death. Interference with each step of the parthanatic cascade has been shown to be neuroprotective in a
variety of models. Once AIF enters the nucleus, large scale DNA fragmentation (chromatinolysis) occurs
through the Parthanatos Associated AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor) Nuclease (PAAN) also known as MIF,
where PAAN/MIF is a major mediator of parthanatic cell death in acute ischemic disorders via its nuclease
activity. Recently, MIF has been suggested to be required for inflammasome activation. Accordingly, we
propose to explore the use of a first in class, MIF nuclease inhibitor in stroke models and explore the
contributions of PAAN/MIF’s nuclease activity in the activation of cGas and STING pathway and subsequent
NLRP3 activation. We will also dissect the role of PAAN/MIF’s nuclease activity in neurons versus microglia
in ischemic injury. Understanding the mechanisms of PAAN/MIF’s nuclease activity in neuronal injury will lead
to innovative therapeutic approaches to treat neurodegenerative diseases and stroke."

Depression is one of the most common disorders of mental health, affecting 7–8% of the population and causing
tremendous disability to afﬂicted individuals and economic burden to society. In order to optimize existing treat-
ments and develop improved ones, we need a deeper understanding of the mechanistic basis of this complex
disorder. Previous work in this area has made important progress but has two main limitations. (1) Most studies
have used non-invasive and therefore imprecise measures of brain activity. (2) Black box modeling used to link
neural activity to behavior remain difﬁcult to interpret, and although sometimes successful in describing activity
within certain contexts, may not generalize to new situations, provide mechanistic insight, or efﬁciently guide
therapeutic interventions.
 To overcome these challenges, we combine precise intracranial neural recordings in humans with
a suite of new eXplainable Artiﬁcial Intelligence (XAI) approaches. We have assembled a team of exper-
imentalists and computational experts with combined experience sufﬁcient for this task. Our unique dataset
comprises two groups of subjects: the Epilepsy Cohort consists of patients with refractory epilepsy undergoing
intracranial seizure monitoring, and the Depression Cohort consists of subjects in an NIH/BRAIN-funded research
trial of deep brain stimulation for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). As a whole, this dataset provides pre-
cise, spatiotemporally resolved human intracranial recording and stimulation data across a wide dynamic
range of depression severity.
 Our Aims apply a progressive approach to modeling and manipulating brain-behavior relationships. Aim 1
seeks to identify features of neural activity associated with mood states. It begins with current state-of-the-art
AI models and then uses a “ladder” approach to bridge to models of increasing expressiveness while imposing
mechanistically explainable structure. Whereas Aim 1 focuses on self-reported mood level as the behavioral in-
dex of interest, Aim 2 uses an alternative approach of focusing on measurable neurobiological features inspired
by the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC). These features, such as reward sensitivity, loss aversion, executive at-
tention, etc. are extracted from behavioral task performance using a novel “inverse rational control” XAI approach.
Relating these measures to neural activity patterns provides additional mechanistic and normative understanding
of the neurobiology of depression. Aim 3 uses recurrent neural networks to model the consequences of richly var-
ied patterns of multi-site intracranial stimulation on neural activity. It then employs an innovative “inception loop”
XAI approach to derive stimulation strategies for open- and closed-loop control that can drive the neural system
towards a desired, healthier state. If successful, this project would enhance our understanding of the pathophys-
iology of depression and improve neuromodulatory treatment strategies. It can also be applied to a host of other
neurological and psychiatric disorders, taking an important step towards XAI-guided precision neuroscience.

Testing high volumes of clinical specimens for infectious diseases requires the use of efﬁcient testing approaches.
One approach used by laboratories is a procedure known as group testing (also known as pooled testing). In
its most basic application, portions of specimens from different people are combined together into “groups” so
that each corresponding individual is represented within one group. These groups are tested as if they were only
single specimens. Members of negative groups are declared negative. Members of positive groups are retested
separately in a second stage of testing to determine who is positive and who is negative. When group sizes are
chosen in a statistically appropriate manner, the number of people represented by negative groups is much larger
than those in positive groups. This leads to signiﬁcant reductions in the overall number of tests required when
compared to testing each specimen separately. These reductions subsequently result in signiﬁcant increases
for laboratory testing capacity by applying the resources saved to test more specimens. Current applications of
group testing include: 1) testing blood donations for viruses, including hepatitis B and West Nile; 2) screening for
bacteria that lead to chlamydia and gonorrhea; 3) checking for antiretroviral treatment failure among HIV-positive
individuals; and 4) testing for viruses during a pandemic, including SARS-CoV-2.
 There are different algorithmic approaches to group testing. Members of positive testing groups can be
successively split into smaller groups over two or more stages of testing. Alternatively, individual specimens can
be allocated to multiple groups during the initial stage of testing in an effort to reduce the number of subsequent
stages of testing. The ﬁrst goal of this research to develop new group testing strategies that require few stages.
This will enable laboratories to more easily implement group testing and to report test results quicker. The second
goal is to develop new statistical learning methods for data arising through group testing. These methods will
result in better predictions for the probability of positivity and can be used to develop more efﬁcient approaches
to implement group testing. The third goal is to create tools for laboratories so that they can apply this research.
These tools will include a web-based application that allows laboratories to choose the most efﬁcient group testing
strategy for their particular situation."

Adults attempting weight loss through lifestyle modification (LM) typically find maintenance of behavior change
difficult. Outcomes might be improved if participants are provided with sustained sources of accountability and
support and ongoing opportunities to reflect with others on goal progress. This study proposes that sharing
digital data (i.e., body weight from wireless scale, physical activity from wearable sensor, and dietary intake
from smartphone app) with other parties has the potential to improve long-term weight loss. The benefit of
device data sharing has not yet been rigorously tested, and traditional LM programs do not yet incorporate
digital data sharing in a systematic way. The proposed study will enroll adults (N = 320) with overweight/
obesity in a 24-month LM program and instruct them to use digital tools for self-monitoring of weight, physical
activity, and eating on a daily basis. Groups will meet face-to-face weekly in months 1-3 to initiate weight loss.
In months 4-24, intervention contact will be remote and will include the following: quarterly group meetings held
via videoconference; brief phone calls with the coach held twice per quarter; and monthly text messages with
the coach, with a small group of fellow group participants, and with a friend or family member outside of the
program. A 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design will test the independent effects of three types of data sharing
partnerships: Coach Share, Group Share, and Friend/Family Share. Half of the participants will receive Coach
Share and half will not; half will receive Group Share and half will not; and half will receive Friend/Family Share
and half will not. In Coach Share, the behavioral coach will view digital self-monitoring data throughout the
program and will directly address data observations during intervention contacts. In Group Share, participants
in a given LM group will view each other’s self-monitoring data in their small-group text messages. In
Friend/Family Share, a friend or family member outside of the group will view the participant’s data via
automated text message. Each party with whom data are shared will be trained to respond by eliciting
reflection from the index participant on his/her goal progress, which is a key component of self-regulation, and
supporting the participant’s motivation to meet program goals. Amount of intervention contact between the
participant and each party (Coach, Group, Friend/Family) will be comparable across treatment conditions,
isolating the effects of data sharing components. Outcomes will be measured at months 0, 6, 12, and 24. The
study will determine if Coach Share, Group Share, and Friend/Family Share each improve long-term weight
loss, PA, and calorie intake (i.e., outcomes will be compared for participants who are randomized to engage in
that data sharing partnership, versus those who are not). The study also will examine if effects are additive
when participants are assigned to engage in more than one type of data sharing partnership. Mediators and
moderators of intervention effects will be examined. As digital technology makes data sharing increasingly
feasible, it is critical to determine how to optimize these partnerships to improve long-term outcomes in LM."
10840329,"Tauopathies are a class of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by accumulation of
abnormal and hyperphosphorylated tau protein in the brain including Alzheimer's disease (AD),
Parkinson's disease (PD), Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and Motor Neuron Disease (MND).
Tauopathies occur primarily in elderly population and incidence rises with increasing age.
Unfortunately, the mechanisms for the age-dependent onset of tauopathies are unknown and
there are no effective therapeutic strategy. Aging is the biggest risk factor for tauopathies
related disorders, suggesting that molecular alterations contributing to the aging process may
represent common mechanisms for tau pathology. Employing the pathways that could slow or
delay the aging process may offer novel targets for new therapeutic strategies.
Murine mutant mice with slow rates of aging and murine tauopathy models with varying
phenotypic effects provide the opportunity to develop novel genetic models that will allow
studying the interaction of aging and tauopathy. Our proposal is to elucidate the role of the
somatotropic axis in the age-dependent susceptibility to tauopathies. Our study will generate
new models to study the interaction of aging with neurodegenerative diseases in the context of
mutations that slow the aging process."

 Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a dynamic process that requires new interventions to improve
outcomes. End-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) measurement is a tool that is widely recognized, easy to use, and
can potentially provide real-time insights into ongoing resuscitation efforts; however, it has yet to be applied to
individualized medicine. Our overall hypothesis is that integrating ETCO2 capnography into OHCA resuscitation
will improve outcomes. Using innovative signal processing and machine learning methods, we will identify a wide
range of resuscitation quality characteristics over resuscitation, their relation to individual patient characteristics
and predictability of OHCA outcomes.
These goals will be accomplished via the following aims:
Aim 1. Determine the influence of resuscitation interventions on real-time physiologic dynamics and outcomes
in OHCA.
Aim 2. Establish the influence of individual patient characteristics on the real-time physiologic dynamics and
OHCA outcomes.
Aim 3. Develop a novel cardiac arrest resuscitation strategy based upon real-time individualized physiologic
dynamics.
We will create a large repository of cardiopulmonary resuscitation process data encompassing data from over
5300 adult OHCA. This work will define intra-arrest ETCO2 dynamics over resuscitation to allow for the
development of guided resuscitation efforts, and the resultant data will provide a solid foundation for future
hypothesis-driven research.
 Dr. Nassal’s training plan encompasses both formal didactics and experiential training with experienced
mentors and collaborators that will develop a skillset in both signal processing and equitable artificial intelligent
driven algorithms. The team has extensive experience in using machine learning and multimodal signal
processing for classification and predictions in resuscitation. This training program will develop a unique skillset
in advanced cardiac signal processing; artificial intelligence, including equitable machine learning processing;
and expertise in the application of these skills to develop dynamically guided resuscitation strategies that few
other physician-scientist possess."

 Myogenic direct reprogramming from non-muscle somatic cells has become an important strategy to
produce abundant, patient-specific, and disease-specific human myogenic cells, which are highly desirable for
therapeutic applications and disease modeling. As compared to deriving myogenic cells from hiPSCs, direct
reprogramming is substantially quicker, and reprogrammed cells avoid the risk of teratoma formation and retain
aging- and disease-associated epigenetic signatures, which is particularly important for modeling aging-related
muscle diseases. Despite these advantages, applications of directly reprogrammed myogenic cells are
hampered by low reprogramming efficiency and their immature nature. It is challenging to improve
reprogramming through rational design, as molecular mechanisms underlying the process remain largely
unknown; therefore, high-throughput screening (HTS) is an important strategy to expedite discovery of more
efficient direct reprogramming technologies. A major hurdle to effective HTS for direct reprogramming
technologies is the difficulty to establish a simple, low-cost phenotypic readout that truly represents an integrative
biological endpoint defining the target lineage. We recently discovered that myogenic cells cultured on surfaces
patterned with parallel nanogrooves/ridges and functionalized with Matrigel form myotubes aligning nearly
perpendicular to the nanogrooves, and this phenotype is unique and universal for all non-diseased myogenic
cells, regardless of their origin and species. Quantitative analysis of myotube orientations reveals a single peak
near 90°; furthermore, when normal myogenic cells are mixed with diseased cells that do not exhibit this
phenotype, myotube orientation angle decreases with the percentage of the normal myogenic cells. We
hypothesize that when cultured on nanogrooved, Matrigel-functionalized surface, myotubes derived from
reprogrammed cells will exhibit increased orientation angles relative to the nanogrooves with increasing
reprogramming efficiency, and this highly reproducible and quantifiable phenotype will provide a simple, low-
cost, and physiologically relevant readout for effective HTS to discover efficient myogenic reprogramming
technologies. We plan to test our hypothesis by (1) developing a high-throughput screening platform using
myotube orientation relative to nanogrooves as a physiologically relevant readout and use this platform to
discover novel small compounds capable of enhancing myogenic reprogramming efficiency, (2) characterizing
the myotubes at molecular, structural, and functional levels, and (3) dissecting transcriptional and epigenetic
mechanisms underlying the positive effects of the novel compounds. The proposed study will result in new
technologies to generate directly reprogrammed human myogenic cells exhibiting more similarities to true
myogenic cells. The established HTS platform can be used to discover other types of enhancers for myogenic
reprogramming (transcription factors, microRNAs) and the enriched pathways and motifs identified in the cells
reprogrammed with the novel compounds will indicate novel targets to further improve reprogramming efficiency."
10765699,"The mosquito Aedes aegypti is a prolific disease vector that thrives in urban environments. Its explosive
population dynamics are driven by the ability of female Ae. aegypti to seek out standing pools of water to lay
their desiccation-resistant eggs. Of note, females are attracted to the scent of decomposing botanical matter in
water, but only after mating and blood-feeding. In particular, gravid female Ae. aegypti are highly attracted to
the scent of fermenting African Bermuda grass hay in water, which has been exploited for mosquito trapping
strategies in the field that aim to lure this major disease vector to its death during the act of egg laying. We
propose to apply integrative methods to define the molecular and cellular basis of Ae. aegypti olfactory
attraction to hay infusion which will catalyze identification of olfactory circuitry mediating oviposition site search
and novel oviposition attractants for this disease vector. To elucidate candidate chemoreceptors and
associated neurons implicated in mosquito olfactory attraction to hay infusion, we will test the role of different
chemoreceptor classes using loss-of-function genetics and olfactory sensory neuron populations by selectively
disrupting neural activity using cell-type specific neuronal silencing. In parallel, we aim to reverse engineer
attractive blends of oviposition attractants mimicking the scent of hay infusion by leveraging chemical analysis
of infusion headspace combined with neural activity assays that compare olfactory sensitivity and response
amplitudes of non-gravid and gravid mosquitoes to conserved volatile organic compounds found in this this
natural lure. These aims will fundamentally improve our understanding of the chemosensory basis of Ae.
aegypti oviposition site search behavior. From a translational perspective, this research will reveal new
molecular targets in the Ae. aegypti olfactory system to modulate mosquito egg laying behavior and identify
novel synthetic formulations of oviposition attractants for enhanced population surveillance and control of this
globally important disease vector."
10775826,"Monoclonal IgG antibodies (mAbs) constitute a critically important class of drugs for the treatment of a wide
range of diseases. Their abilities to recruit and stimulate immune system cells, which is required for their clinical
effectiveness, especially in the immunotherapeutic treatment of cancer, are harbored in their Fc domains. For
clinically relevant IgG antibodies, Fc domains engage Fc γ receptors (FcγRs) and complement C1q in order to
induce antibody-mediated effector functions that direct the killing of cells in vivo. Methods to engineer IgG Fc
domains to manipulate their in vivo killing capacities lag substantially behind those for customizing their antigen-
binding Fab domains due to the presence of a conserved N-linked glycan in the Fc domain at residue Asn297
that is overwhelmingly the most important molecular determinant of FcγR and C1q binding. The next generation
of immunotherapeutic mAbs depends on our ability to efficiently and rationally modify the chemical structure of
this Asn297-linked glycan. The most important molecular feature of this glycan is a fucose sugar unit connected
through an α-1,6 linkage to the Asn-proximal N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNac) saccharide. The absence of this
core fucose moiety imparts Fc domains with increased binding affinity to FcγR3A, an activating FcγR, resulting
in substantially increased antibody-mediated in vivo cellular killing. Naturally produced antibodies, though, are
fucosylated and, thus, numerous methods have been developed to create antibodies without fucosylation,
resulting in three afucosylated IgG1 antibodies that have recently been approved by the FDA. Antibodies with a
fucose on the Asn297-linked glycan on one Fc chain but not on the other – mono-fucosylated antibodies –
present a third fucosylation state that could provide fine-tuning of antibody-mediated effector functions, thereby
expanding the ability to balance efficacy and toxicity for the treatment of a wide range of diseases. However,
mono-fucosylated antibodies do not exist in nature and have never been produced or engineered. Here we
propose methods to create mono-fucosylated IgG antibodies for the first time and to assess the biological
consequences of antibody mono-fucosylation. We hypothesize that mono-fucosylated IgG antibodies will exhibit
biophysical and functional properties distinct from those of fully afucosylated and di-fucosylated IgG antibodies,
which can be leveraged to develop a new class of immunotherapeutic monoclonal antibodies that will induce
levels of antibody-mediated effector functions optimal for certain clinical indications. This work is significant
because it develops and explores an entirely new class of engineered antibodies that could become important
for the immunotherapeutic treatment of cancer. The proposed studies are innovative in that they will investigate
an entirely novel concept – mono-fucosylated antibodies – with the potential to manipulate antibody-mediated
effector functions in ways that have never been explored before. The research plan will be accomplished by
leveraging our expertise in IgG-specific glycan remodeling, molecular biophysics and structural biology."

Many invasive fungal diseases start when spores inhaled from the environment break dormancy
and begin active growth within the host. Despite their critical importance to the fungal life cycle
and potential as antifungal targets, the establishment and maintenance of spore dormancy are
poorly understood.
The proposed pilot study in the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus focuses on fungal-
specific genes of unknown function that have high transcript levels in dormant asexual spores
(conidia) and low levels in actively growing cells. Genes with this particular expression pattern,
designated hic (high in conidia) genes, are likely to be involved in the establishment or
maintenance of spore dormancy. In the proposed pilot study, the 25 hic genes with the most
differential transcript levels in dormant vs nondormant cells will be characterized through
deletion and tagging. Deletion strains will be analyzed for changes in development, dormancy,
and germination using flow cytometry and microscopy. Tagged strains will be analyzed for
localization of Hic proteins during development, dormancy, and germination using fluorescence
microscopy. Tagged strains will also be used in affinity purification and mass spectroscopy to
identify interacting proteins.
Successful completion of the proposed pilot study will identify a set of genes important for
establishing and maintaining dormancy in fungal conidia along with localization and interaction
data for the transition to dormancy during development and from dormancy to active growth."
10813216,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Although mind-body interventions effectively improve psychological and physical symptoms among cancer
patients, few studies have included Black cancer patients. In particular, none exists that targets Black cancer
patients dealing with advanced cancer, who are vulnerable to unmanaged symptoms and report greater
symptom severity and burden than their non-Hispanic White (NHW) counterparts. Prior to evaluating definitive
efficacy in this population fundamental aspects regarding the feasibility and acceptability of a mind-body
intervention, particularly in the area of intervention format, must be examined. For instance, while mind-body
interventions are typically delivered in group-based settings, the palliative care literature has increasingly
identified the need to include family caregivers in supportive care interventions as they play a central role in
patients’ healthcare. This family-based approach may allow for patient-caregiver discussions pertaining to joint
coping with the cancer diagnosis and also addressing caregivers’ psychological distress, which often reach
clinical levels. However, such a family-based intervention may inadvertently decrease access to care, if many
Black patients do not have family members who are consistent care providers or able/willing to participate jointly
in the intervention. It is currently unknown whether a family-based mind-body practice is feasible and acceptable
in Black patients with advanced cancer. To address these critical knowledge gaps, the objective of the proposed
research is to determine the feasibility of implementing a culturally adapted mind-body intervention (Meditation-
Based Support-Adapted; MBS-A) as a supportive care strategy in Black patients diagnosed with advanced
cancer. The original MBS intervention includes four 60-minute sessions delivered over 4 weeks that integrates
guided meditations (e.g., mindfulness, compassion, gratitude) with emotional processing techniques, which have
previously been tested in predominantly NHW patient-caregiver dyads as well as in a patient group setting. To
determine the intervention format for the MBS-A program (family- vs group-based) and solicit input on the original
MBS intervention regarding content that needs adaptation, we will first conduct formative research that includes
quantitative surveys and in-depth interviews of patients and their primary caregivers. Once the intervention
format is determined and content adapted, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine the
feasibility of the MBS-A intervention vs. a dose-matched attention control arm receiving a psychoeducation
intervention. Participants will be assessed at baseline (prior to randomization) and 6 and 12 weeks later. Primary
outcomes include indicators of feasibility regarding the overall RCT design and intervention-specific procedures.
Results of this study will inform future research in which effects and mechanisms of the intervention will be tested
using fully powered samples of Black advanced cancer patients to ultimately improve health in this underserved
patient population."

 The climate crisis, in combination with other social and environmental stressors, negatively influences
human health; its impact varies across age groups and life stages. Pregnancy is an understudied critical
window of susceptibility. Few studies have focused on the impact of prenatal exposure to climate stressors on
pregnant populations and infants in the Southeastern US, despite pronounced trends in climate warming, an
escalating maternal death rate, and persistent maternal and infant health disparities in the region. An important
science gap remains in identifying national climate change and health surveillance indicators, particularly for
understanding the relationship between climate change and pregnancy risks. Our long-term goal is to develop
clinic-based and public health interventions to reduce the adverse impact of climate change during pregnancy.
The overarching goal of this population-based study is to examine extreme temperature-sensitivities in
maternal and infant health risk during critical windows of pregnancy and advance understanding of the
social-environmental drivers of health disparities in a changing climate. We will achieve the following two
specific aims: Aim 1. Characterize the relationship between exposure to cold and hot ambient temperature
extremes and adverse maternal and infant health outcomes during critical periods of pregnancy; Aim 2.
Examine the joint effects of prenatal exposure to temperature extremes and socio-environmental stressors on
excess maternal and infant health risks. The new NIH Climate Change and Health Strategic Initiative has
prioritized protecting the health of pregnant populations in the face of extreme temperatures. This low-cost
retrospective birth cohort study will advance understanding on how social and environmental conditions that
occur during pregnancy interact with climate change stressors to negatively affect the health of pregnant
populations and their infants. Our expected outcomes will include: 1) the quantification of prenatal exposure to
climate change as a risk multiplier during pregnancy; and 2) the identification of maternal and infant
surveillance indicators for tracking the health effects of climate change. The proposed research is innovative
because results will 1) show how climate and social stressors interact to exacerbate climate-health risks during
pregnancy, and 2) aid in hypothesis generation on the pathways that contribute to climate resilience and the
reduction of maternal and infant health risks. This work has significant potential to be transformative to the
field through the identification of maternal or infant health outcomes as potential surveillance health indicators
of climate change impacts, which can be leveraged to measure local and state-level health interventions and
policy changes in the United States. Results will address a well-cited research need from the NIH Strategic
Climate & Health Initiative on the timing of exposure to climate stressors and associated maternal and infant
complications and the critical windows of susceptibility during the prenatal period."

 The first critical step for enveloped viruses, such as HIV-1, to enter host cells is viral membrane fusion.
Viral fusion proteins are fascinating protein folding machineries capable of adopting completely different
conformations during the fusion process; they are also important vaccine and therapeutic targets. Previous
studies have revealed both pre- and post-fusion conformations of the soluble fragments of many viral fusion
proteins, but less is known for structures of their fusion peptide, transmembrane and membrane-proximal
regions in the context of lipid bilayers. There is strong evidence for functional roles of the membrane-
interacting regions in fusion, and yet mechanistic studies on how they exert their functions remain scarce. We
hypothesize that membrane-interacting regions of other fusion proteins related to HIV-1 envelope
protein (Env) adopt defined oligomeric structures that are critical for the stability, function and
antigenicity of the full-length proteins in membrane. In the studies that we completed during the previous
funding period, we have determined the structures of the TM, membrane proximal external region, and
cytoplasmic tail of HIV-1 Env in bicelles that mimic lipid bilayers using the latest NMR technology. We find that
these regions all form well-ordered trimeric clusters and are conformationally coupled, and that disrupting them
can reduce fusion and alter the antigenic structure of the entire Env. In this application, we propose to apply
our NMR/bicelle technology to investigate the membrane regions of SIV Env and the recently emerged SARS-
CoV-2 spike (S), and to use cryo-electron microscopy to determine structures of the full-length proteins
reconstituted in lipid nanodiscs. We will define roles in membrane fusion of critical structural elements of these
regions by deep mutagenesis and functional assays. We will purse the following specific aims: 1) we will
investigate the membrane-interacting components of SIV Env; 2) we will investigate the membrane-interacting
components in the postfusion arrangement; 3) we will determine structures of the full-length SIV Env and
SARS-CoV-2 S in the context of membrane; 4) we will elucidate roles of the membrane-interacting domains of
HIV/SIV Env and SARS-CoV-2 S in their stability, function and antigenicity."

The COVID-19 pandemic has to-date disproportionately negatively impacted those that experience other
intersecting forms of socioeconomic disadvantage and inequity, including youth who identify as Black,
Indigenous or as a Person of Color (BIPOC), or whose families are below the poverty line. Among BIPOC
youth, these stressors may be experienced in intersection with other adverse childhood experiences (ACEs),
and they are also less likely to have resources to mitigate the impact of these stressors. One key, and
potentially modifiable, protective pathway to supporting youth resilience during and beyond the COVID-19
pandemic is physical activity (PA), which can support both physical and mental health. Schools are considered
central to equitable promotion of PA and the CDC recommends they adopt a Comprehensive School PA
Program (CSPAP), an evidence-based framework for how to increase PA before, during, and after school;
however only about 3% of US secondary schools have PA practices that include all domains of the CSPAP
framework. CSPAP-based interventions have the most barriers to sustainability in low resource school districts
that serve student populations that experience intersecting forms of socioeconomic disadvantage. There are
three core reasons that existing CSPAP-based approaches are not meeting the needs of this population: youth
who have experienced trauma have unique needs in PA settings, (2) physical education teachers require
training in trauma-sensitive approaches and (3) Staffing constrains the ability of schools to implement new
opportunities for PA. There is thus a critical need to determine how to effectively support schools in low
resource communities in increasing PA opportunities, with a particular emphasis on meeting the PA-related
needs of youth who have experienced ACEs and trauma related to COVID-19 or otherwise. We have
developed and conducted feasibility testing of a trauma-sensitive adaptation of CSPAP, and are proposing a
Hybrid Type I implementation-effectiveness trial of this trauma-adapted CSPAP using a stepped-wedge design
to compare schools when they are in the intervention versus control phases. We hypothesize that this
intervention will increase PA opportunities for students, and they will engage in significantly more
(accelerometer-measured) physical activity, demonstrate greater gains in fitness/physical literacy, and report
better psychosocial functioning, during the intervention phase versus the control phase. We will also examine
differential effects of all student level outcomes by race/ethnicity, family socioeconomic status, and gender.
Using a mixed-methods approach, we will explore systems-level barriers and facilitators to successful
implementation and maintenance so as to inform continued intervention improvement, sustainability, and
scalability. This project would inform best practices related to school-centered promotion of youth PA with the
goal of decreasing inequities in youth PA opportunities, health and well-being that is both scalable and has
applicability beyond a pandemic."

When asked, most persons with high-level spinal cord injury (SCI) would elect brain surgery to improve their
hand control, yet even the state-of-the-art intracortical brain computer interfaces (iBCI) have only limited control
of finger motion and no direct control of applied forces whatsoever. The exclusive use of kinematics in iBCI
control is despite the rich representation of kinetic information in primary motor cortex (M1). We propose to
address these fundamental limitations by mimicking the mammalian neuromuscular system, which controls both
digit motion and the forces they exert through the modulation of muscle activity. We will develop an iBCI that
predicts intended muscle activity (EMG) from M1 recordings in humans, then use these EMG signals to control
joint kinematics, their stiffness, and grasp forces, through a forward musculoskeletal model of the hand. We
hypothesize that this EMG-based iBCI will be an intuitive means for humans with high-level SCI to achieve more
generalizable control of their hand movements than with existing kinematic iBCIs.
Decoders for use by paralyzed humans are typically built by recording spiking activity from M1 as the user
attempts to imitate the observed motion of a cursor or a robotic arm. The decoder is computed by correlating
measured M1 activity with the observed kinematics. Though similar in concept, our approach to decoder
development is more challenging, as the high-dimensional motor output signals it requires – the EMGs – cannot
be directly visualized or imitated. To circumvent this problem, we will record EMGs (as well as hand posture and
contact forces) as able-bodied people perform a broad range of motor actions. We will also record M1 spiking
activity as paralyzed individuals observe and attempt to imitate the same actions. The able-bodied EMG data
will provide the output signals for decoder calculation, analogous to the use of observed the trajectory in
kinematic decoders. This real-time, EMG-based iBCI will allow participants to control a hand, using it to apply
forces to grasped objects in a way that mimics natural motor control. Initial development will be done in virtual
reality (VR). Subsequently, participants will use the same biomimetic iBCI to control a robotic hand in tasks
designed to replicate activities of daily life. We will compare the users' performance with this biomimetic iBCI to
that of a state-of-the-art kinematic iBCI. When successful, these methods will have application to the control of
robotic limbs for patients with limb loss, and as a means to restore movement of the user's own limbs through
Functional Electrical Stimulation. They could also be applied to the legs, where control of interaction forces and
limb impedance through muscle cocontraction is also critical."

In eukaryotes, transcription Mediator contains a dissociable Cdk8 kinase module (CKM) that regulates gene
expression through kinase-dependent and -independent functions. The human CKM consists of Med13,
Med12, Cdk8, and CycC subunits, which are either mutated or amplified in neurodevelopmental disorders and
multiple cancers, such as breast and colorectal cancers. Despite extensive links between CKM and human

There is an emerging epidemic of head and neck cancer caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) among both
smokers and nonsmokers. While vaccination of boys and girls prior to genital HPV exposure is likely to reduce
HPV+ HNC, the impact of vaccination won’t be realized for decades. In the meantime, HPV+ HNC patients are
treated with disfiguring surgeries and combined chemoradiation approaches, which are associated with
significant short- and long-term morbidities. Individuals with recurrent/metastatic HPV+ HNC generally
succumb to their disease. My research program will apply new approaches in functional genomics and
mapping networks of physical interactions among cancer proteins in relevant and unique HPV+ HNC
preclinical models to translate cancer dependencies in this malignancy into more effective and less toxic
therapies. In this proposal, I build upon our past success in 1) defining key genomic “driver” alterations in HNC;
2) developing novel therapeutic approaches; and 3) translating our discoveries using relevant preclinical
models into clinical treatments for HNC patients. My future research program seeks to 1) define the key
genetic alterations that mediate HPV+ HNC growth in conjunction with determination of the protein interactome
to identify new therapeutic targets; 2) determine the mechanisms of each target and its role in HPV+ HNC; and
3) translate these findings into new treatments for HPV+ HNC. I will begin with the study of targets that have
emerged in our research as relevant in HPV+ HNC such as alterations that activate phosphatidylinositol 3-
kinase (PI3K) signaling including mutation or amplification of PIK3CA, or PTEN loss, and activation of the
EGFR family member HER3. When relevant, I will extend these findings to other HPV+ cancers including
cervical and anal cancers as well as HPV- HNC, which remain lethal. With deep expertise in the molecular
pathogenesis and care of patients with HNC; experience leading multi-disciplinary teams focused on
translational research approaches for this disease and a rich network of basic science and clinical

Oncogenes and tumor suppressors directly highjack the cell’s translation apparatus to make their own tailored
proteome to direct specific steps in cancer development. This is molecularly achieved through translationally
regulated nodes of gene expression that can direct cancer initiation and progression. My lab has been at the
forefront of this research by generating modern tools and developing the first genetic loss- and gain-of-function
mouse models for distinct components of the translation machinery which, in combination with new
quantitative measures of the translational landscape of gene regulation, have led to a fundamental change in
our understanding regarding the molecular origins of cancer. In this proposal, we will leverage and extend our
long-standing interests in translational control in cancer to address three major goals, as follows: 1) What are
the synthetic lethal interactions targeting the aberrant translation control program in cancer? Here, we will
characterize a series of novel synthetic lethal genetic interactions with the major cap-binding protein eIF4E
that we have discovered specific to cancer cells. For example, we will elucidate a surprising genetic interaction
between translational control and splicing as well as translation and mitochondrial proteostasis. We will
translate these findings to in-vivo mouse models as well as xenografts and patient-derived xenografts to define
the importance of such synthetic lethal interactions in human cancers and target them by employing new
selective compounds that block eIF4E hyperactivation in human cancers. 2) How is translation control linked
to metabolic programs in cancer cells? As nutrient abundance drives anabolic processes, such as protein
synthesis, we will determine how translation control influences metabolic homeostasis linked to diet and the
cellular environment in cancer. We will assess the functional consequences of genetically and
pharmacologically modulating eIF4E activity in cancers associated with obesity and employ unbiased profiling
methods to delineate the impact of eIF4E on metabolic signaling that circulates in the blood stream. 3) What
are the mechanisms by which oncogenes direct the formation of “cancer ribosomes”? A fundamentally
unanswered question is whether the presence of distinct ‘cancer ribosomes’ may drive translation of the
cancer genome to direct specific steps in cancer development. We will establish the first systematic, and
large-scale characterization of ribosome composition and study its genome-wide impact on gene regulation
during distinct phases in Myc-induced tumor development. Importantly, changes in ribosome composition may
offer a completely new therapeutic pipeline to selectively inhibit human ribosomes that translate specific,
cancer-causing mRNAs."
10873228,"Project Title: Role of amygdala inhibitory circuit neuromodulation in stress disorders
Project Summary
Traumatic stress exposure can lead to long-term stress disorders and represents a considerable risk factor for
suicide. Stress disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol use disorder have significant
links with suicidality and are characterized by plasticity of neural circuits and neurochemical signaling in the
amygdala, particularly in the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA). The BLA integrates neural inputs from
multiple sources and assigns emotional valence to information by establishing distinct streams of information
outflow. BLA circuits process inputs to form emotional memories based on the excitation/inhibition balance set
by the relative excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to the principal output neurons of the BLA. While
potentiation at excitatory synapses is the foundation of memory formation, inhibitory circuits regulate the
excitation/inhibition balance to control synaptic potentiation, and neuromodulatory signals tune the synaptic
interactions. Noradrenergic modulation is thought to signal arousal and contribute significantly to the emotional
salience of information processed in the amygdala. Our preliminary preclinical findings in mice suggest that
norepinephrine (NE) exerts robust regulatory control over GABAergic parvalbumin (PV) and cholecystokinin
(CCK) inhibitory inputs to the BLA principal neurons, and that this control is compromised following traumatic
stress exposure. We propose to characterize the noradrenergic modulation of PV and CCK synaptic inputs to
the BLA principal neurons, and to define the role of noradrenergic modulation of synaptic inhibition in BLA-
mediated fear memory formation. We will target the noradrenergic afferent regulation of PV and CCK
interneuronal circuits using chemogenetic and optogenetic strategies. We will interrogate local PV and CCK
interneuron inhibitory synaptic signaling in the BLA for noradrenergic neuromodulation using patch clamp
recordings in slices of amygdala. We will use behavioral paradigms to determine the role of the noradrenergic
modulation of BLA inhibitory circuits in fear consolidation and extinction. Finally, we will test for traumatic stress-
induced plasticity of the noradrenergic modulation of inhibitory circuits and the PV and CCK circuit regulation of
fear learning. These studies together will reveal the mechanisms of the noradrenergic modulation of BLA circuits
and provide important insights into the role(s) of distinct perisomatic inhibitory circuits in the control of BLA-
dependent fear memory formation, as well as into how these circuits are disrupted by traumatic stress exposure."

The expression and retrotransposition of Long Interspersed Element-1s (L1s), a type of
endogenous retroelement (RTE), induces Type I IFN (IFNα and IFNβ) in epithelial cells through
activation of Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) including retinoic acid-inducible gene I
(RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs). Interferon stimulated genes drive mechanisms which repress L1,
as part of a feedback loop, and which can also lead to cell death. Therefore, RTE/L1 de-
repression and subsequent IFN induction (termed viral mimcry) is currently being studied as a
potential mechanism to kill cancer cells, and a better understanding of the underlying
mechanisms will benefit cancer therapeutic development. Our lab discovered that condensin I
and condensin II complexes inhibit endogenous and transfected L1 expression and
retrotransposition in primary and transformed epithelial cells. Condensins are essential, multi-
subunit complexes that are known for their canonical functions in organizing the genome. Our
preliminary data show that condensin I and condensin II proteins are necessary for L1-mediated
induction of Type I IFNs in both cancer-derived and primary epithelial cells, and may cooperate
with one another in the cytoplasm to induce IFN. Importantly, condensin insufficient cells fail to
induce transcription of Type I IFN, even though endogenous L1 expression is increased, placing
condensin proteins downstream of L1 in this pathway and suggesting a novel role for
condensins in RTE-mediated innate immune signaling. The overall objectives of this proposal
are to determine how L1 expression influences condensins to promote Type I IFN transcription
and uncover novel roles for condensins in L1-mediated innate immune signaling responses. Our
central hypothesis is that condensin I and condensin II complexes cooperate to promote RLR
pathway-driven Type I IFN induction in response to increased levels of L1 RNA. We will test this
hypothesis through the following aims: AIM 1. Determine whether increased L1 RNA levels
impact condensin protein localization, association, and activity, and AIM 2. Identify the
mechanisms by which condensin proteins facilitate Type I IFN induction in response to L1
expression. The expected outcomes of the proposed work include the identification of new roles
for condensins in innate immune signaling, identification of potential roles for cytoplasmic
condensin proteins, and a better understanding of how L1 expression facilitates Type I IFN
induction in both tumor-derived and primary cells. These findings will lay the foundation for
future development of novel therapeutics that modulate RTE-mediated IFN induction to kill
cancer cells."

The objective of this proposal is to gain mechanistic and pathological understanding of protein glycosylation
and trafficking. During the previous funding cycle, we have made important contributions to this process. We
have determined the structure of the transmembrane domain insertase EMC complex, revealing an elongated
cavity in the transmembrane region of the structure that can accommodate a weakly hydrophobic
transmembrane helix. We have solved the structures of the protein N-glycosyltransferase (OST) and the
protein O-mannosyltransferase Pmt1-Pmt2, revealing the evolutionarily conserved GT-C folds of their catalytic
subunits. Protein trafficking requires lipid vesicle formation, a process that is dependent on lipid flippase activity
to establish compositional asymmetry between the two leaflets of the bilayer. In this regard, we have
determined the structures of all three classes of yeast lipid flippases. This renewal proposal continues our
overarching goal to understand protein glycosylation and trafficking. We propose to address two specific
knowledge gaps: the structure and mechanism of two protein mannosyltransferases, and how the recently
discovered ternary protein complex Arl1-Gea2-Drs2 couples lipid flipping activity with membrane curvature
formation, thereby facilitating the downstream vesicle budding process for protein and membrane trafficking.
Drs2 is a phosphatidylserine flippase required for the formation of AP-1/clathrin-coated vesicles that travel
back and forth between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and early endosomes. The small GTPase Arl1 is a
member of the ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) family that is activated by the Arf guanine nucleotide exchange
factor Gea2. Arl1 operates exclusively in the TGN and is the least well-understood member of the Arf family.
We will reconstitute the ternary complex in vitro and perform a comprehensive structure-function study. Protein
glycosylation and trafficking is intimately linked to tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Our mechanistic
studies will fill these fundamental knowledge gaps, and our derived structures may facilitate the development
of small molecules for cancer treatment."
10827505,"Following the immediate injury to intrinsic kidney cells induced by ischemia/reperfusion, we and others
have demonstrated an important role for innate immune cells in both propagation of injury and subsequent
recovery. There is an initial renal influx of neutrophils after ischemic injury, followed a few hours later by
accumulation of proinflammatory monocytes and activation of resident renal macrophages. Within days after
the injury, the majority of renal macrophages shift from a proinflammatory to an anti-inflammatory and pro-
resolution phenotype, which is essential for effective repair and resolution of the injury. Meanwhile, with
moderate ischemic injury, neutrophil numbers in the injured kidney progressively decrease, and relatively few
neutrophils remain after 72 hours. Although neutrophil apoptosis and efferocytosis by macrophages is an
important mechanism of neutrophil clearance, in addition, in other tissues, studies have shown that intact
neutrophils may also exit the tissue through “reverse migration”. Mechanisms underlying the resolution of
inflammation are an area of active investigation. The question of what mediates resolution of inflammation, and
specifically what mediates the resolution of the inflammation resulting from ischemic AKI, remains unresolved.
 Cyclooxygenase (COX) is the rate-limiting enzyme that metabolizes arachidonic acid to prostaglandin G2 and
subsequently to prostaglandin H2, thereby serving as the precursor for subsequent metabolism by
prostaglandin synthases. More than 20 years ago, Gilroy et al. reported a paradox in sterile inflammation.
Pharmacologic COX-2 inhibition at the early phase (2h) accelerated recovery while the same pharmacologic
inhibition prevented recovery when applied 24h later, suggesting that COX-2 may have different roles in
neutrophils and macrophages in inflammation resolution.
 We have recently we have reported that COX-2 expression increased in renal macrophages following
ischemic injury, and selective deletion of COX-2 or the PGE2 receptor subtype 4 (EP4) with myeloid-specific
Cre recombinases delayed recovery, resulting in persistent inflammation in the post-ischemic kidney and
subsequent tubulointerstitial fibrosis. In our new preliminary results, we now surprisingly find that selective
deletion of neutrophil COX-2 expression results in decreased injury in response to an ischemic insult. We
propose that the macrophage COX-2/PGE2 axis promotes recovery from AKI, but the neutrophil COX-2/PGE2
axis has the opposite effect and is important for the initial injury induced by neutrophil infiltration. The goal of
our proposed studies is to further our understanding of mechanisms of resolution from AKI by characterizing the
disparate roles and mechanisms played by the COX-2/prostaglandin system in neutrophils and macrophages
following acute ischemic kidney injury. We have two specific aims:
Specific Aim 1 Determine the role of the macrophage COX-2-PGE2-axis in recovery from ischemic AKI
Specific Aim 2 Determine the role of COX-2 in neutrophil function in response to ischemic AKI"

The Georgia Department of Public Health Occupational Safety and Health Surveillance Program
(GA-OHS) proposes to strengthen its current occupational safety and health surveillance and
build upon its capacity by establishing a Fundamental-Plus Program. GA-OHS will continue to
systematically collect, analyze, interpret, and disseminate data on the state employment profile
and the 24 OHIs that have been recommended by the National Institute for Occupational Safety
and Health (NIOSH) and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE).
Additionally, the GA-BRFSS, will be analyzed annually to obtain data for two identified state-
specific OHIs: workplace secondhand smoke exposure and arthritis among employees. Georgia
Violent Death Reporting System (GA-VDRS) data will also be analyzed annually for a new
state-specific indicator on work-related violent deaths to determine the magnitude of workplace
and work-related homicides and suicides in Georgia.
GA-OHS will conduct in-depth analyses and surveillance of OHIs with rates that have increased
over time in Georgia, OHIs that have rates above the national average, and those identified as
emerging issues. These priority OHIs and emerging conditions include work-related
transportation incidents, work-related pesticide associated illness and injury, and work-related
COVID-19. In collaboration with the DPH Environmental Health Section, GA-OHS will
implement follow-back investigations of resident incident cases age 16 years and older with
elevated BLLs of ≥ 25 µg/dL.
GA-OHS proposes to maintain and build upon its current capacity to conduct Fundamental OH
Surveillance by establishing two new in-depth surveillance activities (Fundamental-Plus
projects). For Project One, GA-OHS will conduct in-depth assessment and follow-back activities
for work-related and workplace suicides. Follow-back activities will be conducted with employers
who would like to receive mental health trainings or resources available for their employees. For
Project Two, GA-OHS will work in collaboration with the Georgia Council on Respiratory Health
Promotion and DPH Asthma Control and Prevention Program to create a policy and intervention
program for work-related asthma.
GA-OHS will maintain an Advisory Committee including representatives of key partners and
stakeholder organizations and agencies. We will also participate fully in CDC/NIOSH- and
recipient-convened meetings or conference calls of grantees and collaborate with other state
surveillance programs and key organizations on topics of mutual interest. GA-OHS will use
results from data analyses and surveillance findings to inform the development of new
partnerships and facilitate implementation of intervention and/or prevention activities. Expected
project outputs and outcomes include, but are not limited to:
 • Occupational health surveillance reports, data summaries, and scientific journal articles
 • Increased awareness and development of resources for work-related transportation
 incidents, work-related pesticide injuries/illnesses, and work-related COVID-19
 • Development and dissemination of lead exposure educational materials, guidance, and
 training resources for workers and employers to help reduce occupational lead
exposures
 • Increased awareness of workplace and work-related suicides in Georgia
 • Development and dissemination of resources to increase mental health awareness in
workplaces
 • Development and dissemination of work-related asthma educational materials for health
 care providers, employers, and workers
 • A policy for surveillance and intervention of work-related asthma."
10834225,"This proposal aims to develop novel, more effective, and selective therapies for the treatment of Helicobacter
pylori infections. Chronic infection with H. pylori causes peptic ulcers and gastric cancer. H. pylori is an
important drug-resistant pathogen, which is categorized as a high-priority pathogen by the WHO. Standard
therapy consists of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and two broad-spectrum antibiotics, usually clarithromycin
with either metronidazole or amoxicillin. These combinations are becoming increasingly ineffective with high
resistance rates, and substantially disrupt the gut's healthy microbiome. There is a considerable unmet need
for novel, more effective, and selective antibiotics to eradicate H. pylori. In our preliminary studies, we identified
the NuoD interface of Complex I as a druggable target for H. pylori. Respiration through Complex I is essential
for H. pylori, but not for most other bacteria, offering mechanistic selectivity and minimizing disruption of the
microbiome. We developed and validated a virtual screening platform for this target to identify leads with
improved pharmacological properties using the initial inhibitors. The virtual screen identifed hits that are
synthetically tractable with demonstrated on-target antibacterial activity, and both ex vivo and in vivo efficacy
against H. pylori. The ultimate aim of the proposal is to obtain carefully validated, narrow spectrum, orally
bioavailable, and efficacious NuoD inhibitors that will form the basis of a subsequent preclinical antibiotic
development effort. These studies will also provide a deeper understanding of H. pylori respiration and the
development of selective antibiotics against H. pylori."

 Hydrocephalus, an imbalance between cerebrospinal fluid production and absorption, is diagnosed in
more than 1 in 500 people in the United States. Approximately 80% of these patients will suffer long-term
neurological deficits. Genetic diseases, meningitis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, traumatic brain injury, or
tumors cause hydrocephalus. The common treatment for all hydrocephalus patients is CSF drainage by
shunting. Despite all our efforts, shunts still have the highest failure rate of any neurological device. A
shocking 85% of shunts fail after just ten years. Failed shunts are plagued with astrocytes and macrophages,
but we still do not understand the process by which these cells are pulled in, migrate, and grow.
 In our first aim, we identify what patient conditions contribute to tissue contact and what variables
trigger tissue pull in into shunt catheter holes. We clearly define physical variables that create instances of
tissue pull in using computational fluid dynamics and a benchtop model (“Brain on a Bench”). We continue the
use of this system in Aims 2 and 3. In this way, we investigate what single or repetitive events cause shunt
catheter contact and tissue pull in with the ventricular wall, parenchyma, or choroid plexus.
 In our second aim, we determine if cell growth is a necessary component to shunt obstruction after
contact with a tissue source occurs. We examine the growth, proliferation, and activation state of the cells
following single or repetitive contact with ventricular wall, parenchyma, and choroid plexus just as we did in
Aim 1.
 In our final aim, we use our heightened awareness of tissue pull in and tissue growth to understand
how changes to shunt design can influence shunt obstruction. We prioritize the clinical conditions shown to
exacerbate tissue contact and test under physical variables that show direct pull in and growth of ventricular
wall, parenchyma, and choroid plexus.
 In summary: our patient data informs us of the patient conditions that correlate to contact of ventricular
wall, parenchyma, and choroid plexus. Benchtop and computational fluid dynamics models prioritize these
environmental conditions while systematically testing what variables cause tissue pull in and growth. Strategies
to prevent obstruction by inhibition of pull in and growth are tailored for ideal performance under the conditions
set by our patient and benchtop data. Altogether, these data improve our mechanistic understanding of shunt
obstruction necessary to and narrow our area of focus for improved treatment of hydrocephalus."
10845609,"RNA editing, a fundamental cellular process, involves the deamination of some adenosines in
RNA to inosines, by the adenosine deaminases Adar1 (ADAR) and Adar2 (ADARB1).
Recent studies have shown that a critical role of RNA editing is to disrupt double-stranded RNA
(dsRNA) structures that are generated by retroelements inserted in the genome in an inverted
orientation within expressed genes. The dsRNA formed by such sequence configurations is a
powerful and dangerous activator of the ancient antiviral interferon response, which may lead to
pathogenic inflammation. While RNA editing has been studied in the context of some organs
and in cancer, very little is known about the role of ADAR enzymes in islet cell function and
health. Our goal is to elucidate the role of RNA editing in islets, and particularly in alpha and
beta cells. Strikingly, GWAS studies of type 1 diabetes (T1D) have revealed protective variants
of IFIH1/MDA5, a cytosolic receptor that recognizes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) from either
viral or endogenous origins, and elicits an inflammatory response. Thus, defective RNA editing
can in principle contribute to the islet anti-viral response which precedes autoimmunity. We
hypothesize that impaired RNA editing and accumulation of endogenous dsRNA in beta cells
trigger an IFIH1-dependent interferon response causing islet inflammation, which leads to beta
cell dysfunction and potentially to autoimmunity. In our preliminary findings, we found that
disruption of A-to-I RNA editing in adult mouse beta-cells in vivo or in human islets triggers an
interferon response. In mice with Adar1-deficient beta cells, this leads to massive immune
response localized to islets, including both innate immune cells and T cells. Alpha cells appear
to resist Adar1 disruption or islet inflammation brought about by Adar1 deficiency in beta cells.
We propose to 1) characterize mouse and human islet cells following genetic disruption of RNA
editing, via knockout or knockdown of the key RNA editing enzyme Adar1; 2) examine the
effects of Adar1 deficiency on beta and alpha cell function and viability, as well as islet
inflammation and autoimmunity; and 3) investigate the molecular basis for the differential
dependence of alpha and other islet cell types on Adart1. The proposed research is a close
collaboration between 3 teams with complementary expertise: Al Powers (human islet biology
and function), Yuval Dor (mouse models, molecular biology) and Erez Levanon (computational
analysis of RNA editing). This work will shed light on the role of RNA editing, a key
epitranscriptomic modification, in islet cells. It will also refute or provide pre-clinical support for
the provocative hypothesis that defective RNA editing may contribute to aspects of T1D
pathogenesis, particularly the early, anti-viral inflammatory response.

10770563,"Cryptococcus neoformans (CN) is an important human fungal pathogen responsible for thousands of deaths
each year, primarily in immunosuppressed individuals. CN makes melanin, a pigment that performs a variety of
functions in the plant and animal kingdoms. In fungi, melanin reinforces cell walls, shields against ultraviolet
radiation and toxic metals, harnesses high-energy electromagnetic radiation, and contributes to virulence. In
addition to contributing to virulence, melanization reduces the susceptibility of fungal cells to antifungal agents
and can contribute to the difficulty in treating fungal infections, which are often chronic and notoriously difficult
to eradicate. Despite its importance, little is known about the structure of melanin because it is insoluble and
amorphous, making it difficult to analyze. This research program takes a multidisciplinary approach to studying
the problem of cryptococcal melanization, combining biochemical, cell biology, and spectroscopic (solid state
NMR) techniques to uncover the mechanisms of melanization and its impact on the host-microbe interaction.
The current application proposes to elucidate the vesicular pathway used to export melanin to the exterior of the
cell, investigate the role of lipids in melanin synthesis, investigate how melanin affects the interactions between
CN and macrophages, and identify small molecule inhibitors of melanogenesis. Agents that target melanin are
potentially valuable because they could be applied against a broad array of pathogenic fungi. Four related but
independent aims are proposed: Aim 1. To establish the mechanism for CN cell wall melanization; Aim 2. To
determine how neutral lipids in lipid droplets influence melanin synthesis and deposition; Aim 3. To establish
the mechanism for how melanization subverts the CN-macrophage interaction; and Aim 4. To identify CN
melanin inhibitors and establish their mechanisms of action."
10832078,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Each year over 124,000 individuals initiate hemodialysis and there are over 490,000 patients receiving
maintenance hemodialysis for end-stage kidney disease in the United States. Cardiovascular (CV) disease
remains the leading cause of death, while each patient has 1.6 hospitalizations annually and around 34% of
patients are readmitted within 30 days. Individuals initiating hemodialysis generally experience further decline in
residual kidney function, a potent risk factor for further morbidity and mortality. Despite the massive burden of
morbidity and morality, few therapies have been tested, with even fewer proven, to reduce the risk of mortality
in this high-risk population.
The development of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) has heralded a paradigm-shift in
nephrology, with dedicated trials in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) reporting substantial reductions
in the risk of CKD progression, proteinuria, and CV outcomes, including hospitalization for heart failure. Despite
initial guidelines suggesting avoiding initiation of SGLT2i in individuals with moderate or severe CKD, in whom
the glucose-lowering effects are attenuated, multiple trials, as well as our own analyses, demonstrate that the
effects on glycemic control only mediate a small portion of the overall clinical benefits. Furthermore, SGLT2i
provide potent kidney and CV risk reduction compared with placebo even in the absence of diabetes, while they
are safe and effectively prevent morbidity and mortality in patients with advanced CKD. However, the safety and
efficacy of these therapies have yet to be tested in end stage kidney disease patients requiring initiation of
hemodialysis.
We therefore propose a phase II, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group pilot clinical trial to test the
safety and efficacy of empagliflozin among adult patients initiating hemodialysis. The results of our study will
inform the design and development of a larger multi-center outcomes trial, which is urgently needed to address
the unacceptably high rates of CV disease and associated mortality in this population. Our proposals are
clinically relevant, feasible, innovative, and are supported by robust literature in non-hemodialysis patients with
CKD. Building on the underlying pathophysiology, the clinical unmet need, and our collective experience in
performance of clinical trials, our proposals have the potential to inform and improve the care of patients requiring
initiation of HD globally."

The goal of this R01 renewal application is to further develop the LED-enhanced NMR technology (LC-photo-
CIDNP) that was established during the prior cycle of funding, and extend the method to the facile and ultra-
rapid 1D-to-3D NMR spectroscopy of proteins at sub-micromolar concentration. We will focus on NMR studies
in solution and will target folded, unfolded and intrinsically disordered proteins in either buffered solution or cell-
like media. We will accomplish the above goals within three steps. First (Specific Aim #1), we will incorporate a
tryptophan (Trp) isotopolog bearing a quasi-isolated 1H-13C spin pair (QISP) within soluble proteins to
achieve unprecedented NMR sensitivity for the detection of solvent-exposed Trp in proteins at nanomolar and
sub-nanomolar levels. We will then employ the above technology in combination with field-cycling to achieve
further NMR sensitivity enhancements. Second (Specific Aim #2) we will extend LC-photo-CIDNP to amino
acids other than Trp and Tyr within proteins. This goal will be accomplished via through-space and through-
bond polarization transfer methodologies. Third (Specific Aim #3), we will extend LC-photo-CIDNP to higher-
dimensionality (>2D) NMR spectroscopy by developing novel 3D (and possibly 4D) 1H,13C heteronuclear
spectroscopy pulse sequences tailored to the analysis of side-chain and backbone 1H-13C resonance pairs.
This effort will include non-uniform-sampling (NUS) data collection schemes. We will then combine theoretical
calculations and experiments to develop better LC-photo-CIDNP dyes with optimized g-factor values and long
photoexcited-state lifetimes, for optimal LC-photo-CIDNP data collection. We will also exploit the peculiar field
dependence of LED-enhanced NMR and implement 2D LC-photo-CIDNP on benchtop NMR spectrometers.
Finally, we will test the success of the improved LC-photo-CIDNP technologies developed in this work by
studying the interaction of an aggregation-prone client protein (SH3 variant) with the Hsp70 molecular
chaperone at sub-micromolar concentration."
10806199,"Background. Despite the significant success of recent therapies, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) remains
the second leading cause of childhood death. The discordance between therapeutic improvements and poor
outcomes is partially caused by the difficulty of salvaging relapsed disease. While outcomes have improved in
de novo treatment, dismal rates of overall survival (less than 25%) were observed in relapsed subtypes of ALL.
The clinical armamentarium for treating relapsed or refractory T-ALL must be supported with new options.
Strategy. While most of T-ALL cases exhibit gain-of-function mutations in Notch signaling, therapies against
Notch have not fulfilled their clinical promise. To identify alternative targets for new therapies, we propose to
define how cell-intrinsic oncogenic events integrate with external signals from the microenvironment. Recent
studies point to the functional impact of “stromal” signals in leukemia biology. However, one significant gap in
this knowledgebase is how microenvironmental factors become essential for leukemogenesis and maintenance.
Preliminary results. According to our results in primary T-ALL cells, activating mutations in Notch failed to
saturate Notch signaling: Notch signal strength increased when T-ALL cells encounter Notch ligands within the
microenvironment – e.g. interleukin 7 (IL-7). The increased strength of Notch signaling correlated with increased
surface expression of IL-7Rα by direct transcriptional activation of the IL-7Rα promoter, resulting in T-ALL hyper-
responsiveness to IL-7. IL-7 also induced the cell cycle regulator SKP2, activated STAT5, and (surprisingly)
STAT3. Primary T-ALL cells showed persistent STAT3 activation and our results suggest STAT3 deletion impairs
T-ALL leukemogenesis. Hypothesis. These data support significant interplay between oncogenic factors and
the microenvironment. According to our hypothesis, interplay between microenvironmental signals (IL-7), Notch
signaling, SKP2, and STAT3 form a reciprocal positive feedback loop that is essential for T-cell leukemogenesis;
this axis also compensates for the action of standard therapies in relapsed and refractory disease.
Approach. To test this, we propose: 1) To determine the temporal requirement for STAT3 deletion in initiation,
progression, and relapse in T-ALL by using a model of inducible genetic deletion of STAT3 in combination with
a model of Notch-induced T-ALL. 2) To map how T-ALL development is affected by Notch/IL-7/STAT3/SKP2
signaling circuitry by using overexpression and gene silencing approaches to define the reciprocal regulation of
Notch, STAT3, and SKP2. 3) To identify the impact of inhibiting Notch/STAT/SKP2 circuitry in relapsed T-ALL
by testing both pre-clinical and clinical inhibitors of STAT signaling and SKP2 inhibitors in pre-clinical PDX
models of T-ALL. Impact. Successful completion of this proposed work will: 1) define how cooperation between
oncogenic signaling and the microenvironment affects therapy of relapsed and refractory T-ALL; 2) build a
foundation for validating new molecular targets in relapsed and refractory T-ALL; 3) provide a proof-of-principle
for an alternative strategy in which entire molecular circuits are considered during the development of therapies."
10800786,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of this research is to address the critical barriers to communication that older and hearing-impaired
listeners face in complex acoustic scenes, in which multiple competing sounds impede speech understanding.
Our approach includes simultaneous behavioral and electrophysiological measures of auditory stream
segregation, and importantly, we also determine the costs and benefits of hearing instruments on segregating
multiple speech sources. Our research has uncovered neural mechanisms associated with age-related
declines in auditory temporal processing that play a critical role in binaural and spatial hearing. Our current
tools, however, lack the precision necessary to gain deeper understanding of this age-related deficit. In the
present study, we propose a series of innovative approaches that aim to determine the functional boundaries
of spatial hearing in listeners with age-related hearing loss (ARHL). In Aim 1, we use a well-established
paradigm of auditory scene analysis to define functional, ecologically relevant boundaries of perception as they
relate to individual binaural cues, and measure how these boundaries are affected by ARHL at the neural level.
Aim 2 introduces novel behavioral and electrophysiological tasks that precisely measure functional boundaries
between segregation and integration of competing speech. Aim 3 evaluates the costs and benefits of
directional microphone technology to hearing-impaired listeners as a function of their individual spatial
segregation boundaries. The present study draws from a long line of research on auditory scene analysis and
introduces a novel approach to cortical tracking of speech envelope in complex scenes. This project pushes
the field forward in how we measure mechanisms of stream segregation in older and hearing-impaired
listeners. The results of these experiments will: (1) precisely characterize individual binaural and spatial
segregation boundaries; (2) provide evidence of the neural circuitry and patterns of activity underlying the
influence of spatial cues on stream segregation; (3) discover evidence for the relationship between binaural
segregation boundaries, individual differences, and the effects of hearing loss and aging; and (4) investigate a
relationship between individual suprathreshold hearing abilities and specific hearing aid processing technology.
Whereas hearing devices currently have remarkable benefits to specific users, the present research should
inspire a new push for innovative ways to address hearing challenges of an aging population. Our team is well-
positioned to execute behavioral and electrophysiological measures sensitive to auditory function and
intervention outcomes, and critically, to bridge these to shift the field toward individualized hearing health care."

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) can be attributed to loss of β-cell identity or de-differentiation, marked by acquisition of
immature cell markers and loss of insulin expression and secretion. While the etiology of β-cell immaturity in T2D
is unclear, impairments in nuclear-encoded mitochondrial gene expression and transcription factor (TF)
expression occur. Additionally, defects in mitochondrial structure and function leads to impaired glucose-
stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and have been reported in β-cells of human T2D patients. Interestingly, the
transcriptional changes that occur during β-cell immaturity involve loss of the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial
gene expression program. My studies will test the hypothesis that β-cell immaturity in T2D is driven by loss of
mitochondrial functional gene regulation by the TFs MAF bZIP transcription factor A (MAFA) or B (MAFB).
Furthermore, I predict that MAFA/MAFB are themselves targets of mito-nuclear crosstalk through a retrograde
signaling cascade induced by defects in mitochondrial function.
 I will elucidate the contribution of MAFA and MAFB on metabolic control in human β cells through
regulation of mitochondrial function (Aim 1). I will determine how loss of MAFA and/or MAFB affects
mitochondrial function and β cell identity by assaying oxygen consumption and gene expression in MAFA and/or
MAFB knockdown human pseudoislets and EndoC-βH3 β cell lines. Metabolomics will be performed on EndoC-
βH3 β cell lines to determine how MAFA/B influences fuel utilization. My preliminary data shows that genetic loss
of mitophagy (i.e., the balance of mitochondrial biogenesis and turnover) reduces β-cell maturity. This includes
physiologic, metabolic, and transcriptional signatures consistent with metabolic overload, oxidative damage, and
the integrated stress response (ISR). MAFA (and likely MAFB) is known to be more sensitive to oxidative stress
associated with T2D β-cell dysfunction than other TFs. While nuclear expression of β-cell mitochondrial genes
are well known, mitochondrial feedback to drive β-cell nuclear gene expression (retrograde signaling) has not
been analyzed. I will delineate if TF levels and β-cell maturity are altered in response to mitochondrial dysfunction
(Aim 2). Further, I observed that pharmacological inhibition of the ISR relieves markers of immaturity in islets of
mitophagy-deficient mice. Utilizing pharmacologic tools and analysis of gene expression in human pseudoislet
transplants and EndoC-βH3 cells, I will interrogate how such conditions impact human β cells. I expect that
MAFA (and possibly MAFB) levels will be reduced because of their ISR sensitivity. Moreover, I will determine if
inhibition of the ISR restores MAFA/MAFB expression and reverses β-cell immaturity in the background of
mitochondrial damage."

Severe maternal morbidity (SMM), which encompasses conditions that put pregnant people most at risk
of dying (e.g., hemorrhage, sepsis, organ failure), doubled in the last two decades. The most common
precursors to SMM – anemia, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), and cesarean birth – are also
increasing. People of color, especially Black and Native American people, are at increased risk for all
these outcomes. This Renewal proposal builds on our prior work to address inequities in maternal
outcomes. Via the Parent Grant, our team enhanced current understanding of the contribution of social
context (focusing on neighborhood social disadvantage) and maternal pre-pregnancy health (focusing on body
mass index) to SMM risk, using a unique data resource we built of California (CA) births. This Renewal uses
theoretically grounded approaches to address several remaining gaps in our understanding of maternal health
in the U.S. that were illuminated by the Parent Grant. We will build a unique resource of 16 million births in
three states from 1997-2021. The dataset longitudinally links vital records (live birth and fetal death certificates)
with hospital discharge data for mother and baby; includes residential address; and links data for repeat
pregnancies to the same person over time, thus providing the type of large-scale data with high-quality
information on maternal health and social context that the field needs to advance population-level research on
maternal health. All phases of the research will be guided by a community advisory board (CAB). Using an
intersectionality framework, Aim 1 will examine joint impacts of multiple forms of marginalization on SMM, its
subtypes (i.e., hypertension-, hemorrhage-, and sepsis-related SMM), and its precursors (i.e., HDP, anemia,
mode of birth). Indicators of marginalization include race-ethnicity, education, health care payer, nativity, and
census tract-level markers of social disadvantage and structural inequality (e.g., poverty, segregation). Using a
reproductive life-course framework, Aim 2 will determine the cumulative impact of social and medical risk
factors across successive pregnancies on maternal health (i.e., SMM, SMM subtypes, SMM precursors). We
will examine how factors related to social context (e.g., persistent census tract poverty), morbidity (e.g.,
persistent HDP), and mode of birth (primary cesarean birth) affect subsequent occurrence and recurrence of
the study outcomes. Aim 3 will use findings from Aims 1 and 2 to identify and prioritize strategies to improve
maternal health and equity. We will use a) causal inference methods (mediation and g-computation) to
understand mechanisms and compare the potential impact of selected hypothetical interventions on study
outcomes and disparities, and b) community-engaged prioritization methods to synthesize our findings and
prioritize next steps. By understanding risks across multiple forms of marginalization and successive
pregnancies, and guided by rigorous analytics and community-grounded knowledge, our work will contribute to
advancing the next generation of actionable population-level SMM equity research."

In early development and over the lifetime of a human, the genome of every somatic cell will eventually
accumulate hundreds of mutations during multiple cell divisions. Although most somatic mutations are
predicted to be non-functional, it is known for a long time that some of the somatic mutations, including
single nucleotide variants (SNVs), copy number variants (CNVs), translocations, etc., may cause serious
diseases like cancer. In the past decade, more and more studies suggested that somatic mutations may
also play important roles in milder complex diseases, such as autism. However, although single-cell or
ultra-deep whole genome sequencing (WGS) technologies can now identify many rare somatic mutations,
these technologies tell little about the consequences or mechanisms of somatic mutations. In fact, unless
a somatic mutation causes significant clonal expansion, characterizing the molecular functions of a
somatic mutation in its native tissue context is extremely challenging. In general, WGS protocol precludes
most of the commonly pursued epigenomic technologies such as ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq. We recent
demonstrated that using a novel deep-learning-based pipeline named DeepLoop, we can upgrade the
super sparse single cell Hi-C maps to kilobase resolution, which may serve as a robust readout of
genome activity. This motivates us to optimize a technology named Dip-C to simultaneously map somatic
mutations and 3D genome from single cells. If successful, the project will deliver a long needed multi-
OMIC tool for SMaHT network. We will test Dip-C in both model cell line and human tissues and verify
its unique capability to resolve how somatic mutations may affect a small number of cells in large
population or complex tissue."
10909894,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by dysregulated host response to
infection, and acute lung injury (ALI) is a leading cause of death associated with sepsis. An
emerging mechanism of sepsis induced-ALI (sepsis-ALI) involves neutrophils/macrophages
undergoing cell death, releasing nuclear histones and citrullinated histone H3 (CitH3) to cause
tissue damage and exacerbate pulmonary injury. CitH3 is catalyzed by peptidylarginine
deiminase 2 and 4 (PAD2 and PAD4). We found that CitH3 is elevated in serum of patients with
sepsis-ALI, but not in ALI patients due to non-infectious causes, suggesting that CitH3 could be
a biomarker, as well as a potential causative factor for sepsis-ALI. Significant elevations of
CitH3 and PAD2 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), not PAD4, are detected in septic
patients. While Pad4-/- mice do not show a clear septic phenotype compared with wild type
littermates, the Pad2-/- mice are strikingly more resistant to sepsis-ALI and other organ
dysfunctions. The improved survival of the Pad2-/- septic mice is linked to enhanced bacterial
clearance due to enhanced function of macrophages. We have data to show that chemical
inhibition of PAD2 and antibody sequestration of CitH3 have therapeutic benefits to treat sepsis-
ALI in mice. Combining our expertise in cell and molecular biology, animal models of and clinical
research in sepsis, and chemical biology, our team-based research aims to dissect the
physiological actions of PAD2 and CitH3 in modulating macrophage function associated with
sepsis (Aim 1), and to conduct proof-of-concept studies targeting PAD2 and CitH3 as novel
means to treat sepsis-ALI in mice (Aim 2). Circulating CitH3 could act as a signaling molecule
and bind to membrane receptor(s) to fulfill its biological function; or CitH3 can enter the host
cells via endocytosis to directly interfere with their survival or death pathways. Thus, knowledge
on the membrane delimited interaction between CitH3 and macrophages will add significant
insight into the pathogenesis and potential treatment of sepsis-ALI and other multi-organ
dysfunctions."
10884226,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The Comprehensive Post-Acute Stroke Services (COMPASS) Study, implemented across the stroke belt
of North Carolina (NC), is a pragmatic trial of comprehensive transitional care for stroke. Forty hospitals were
randomized to deliver the transitional care model (COMPASS-TC) or usual care. COMPASS-TC supports
education, secondary prevention, rehabilitation and recovery following stroke. A key component of the model is
the Movement Matters Activity Program. It is an evidence-based rehabilitation program to maximize survivor
health, recovery, and function in the home and community.
 The COMPASS Study and its Vanguard site have collected data on over 11,000 NC patients hospitalized
for stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) and discharged home. Baseline data provide rich information to
control patient and clinical characteristics that may influence rehabilitation use (i.e., PT/OT visits) and patient
outcomes. Two-day call and clinic visit data include information on social, behavioral, and functional
determinants of health, in addition to clinical information. Ninety-day outcomes include several important
patient-reported measures including the Stroke Impact Scale-16. Linkage of COMPASS data to NC
administrative claims data provide valid information on rehabilitation use in the COMPASS sample.
 Together, the COMPASS Study and administrative claims data constitute a unique and robust data set on
a large and diverse sample. Analyses of these data provide a tremendous opportunity to address gaps in
understanding the use and effectiveness of rehabilitation care (i.e., physical and occupational therapy) after
stroke. Using these data, we propose the following 3 aims: Aim 1 - Identify individual, hospital, and
community-level factors associated with rehabilitation use and the extent to which COMPASS-TC moderates
sociodemographic and geographic relationships; Aim 2 - Examine the effect of COMPASS-TC on rehabilitation
use; Aim 3 - Evaluate the relationship between rehabilitation use and patient-reported and healthcare
utilization outcomes and whether receipt of COMPASS-TC moderates these relationships; and the following 2
exploratory aims: Exploratory Aim 1- Examine the relationship between social, behavioral, and functional
determinants of health (captured as part of the COMPASS-TC electronic care plan) and rehabilitation use;
Exploratory Aim 2- Evaluate the added benefit of clinical data over and above claims-based data in controlling
for confounding by indication.
 Results of this study will fill gaps in our understanding of the use and effectiveness of community-based
rehabilitation in the context of “real world” care and will determine the effectiveness of a comprehensive
transitional care model in improving access to/use of rehabilitation and outcomes for stroke survivors. Such
information is critical as more individuals are surviving stroke and as the U.S. healthcare system moves
towards value-based care delivery (e.g., bundled payments, accountable care organizations, transitional care)."
10868585,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The cerebrovasculature is a highly specialized vascular bed where cellular and molecular components of the
blood-brain barrier (BBB) stringently regulate entry into the central nervous system (CNS). BBB disruption
occurs in diseases such as stroke, brain tumors and multiple sclerosis and thus improved mechanistic
understanding and directed therapies are urgently needed. Through convergent genetic and biochemical studies,
we and others have defined a GPR124/RECK/WNT7 pathway that is essential for BBB function during
embryogenesis and during pathologic states such as stroke and glioblastoma. In the prior granting period, we
demonstrated that the GPI-anchored membrane protein RECK binds and stabilizes newly secreted WNT7 for
presentation to Frizzled (FZD), the canonical WNT receptor. Remarkably, the GPCR-like 7-pass transmembrane
protein GPR124 synergizes with RECK to potently amplify signaling by WNT7A/WNT7B but not by the other 17
WNTs. While GPR124 function in the BBB has been unequivocally established by in vivo knockout (KO) and in
vitro transfection studies, its molecular mechanism remains an enigma and clinical translation has been elusive.
 Here, we pursue both mechanistic and translational investigations into the GPR124/RECK/WNT7
pathway, building upon substantial preliminary data. Aim 1 investigates the hypothesis that GPR124 is crucially
required for coupling of the ligand WNT7 and receptor RECK to the downstream FZD/LRP signaling complex.
We utilize doxycycline-inducible WNT7 expression to initiate WNT7 signaling, surmounting historical difficulties
with WNT7 protein solubility and production, overlaid upon isogenic brain endothelium with and without GPR124
expression, to defining signaling complex dynamics with RECK, FZD and LRP by co-immunoprecipitation and
single molecule resolution live imaging studies. Aim 2 explores the hypothesis that WNT7- and GPR124-
dependent signaling can induce human cerebral angiogenesis and neurovascular unit (NVU) formation,
leveraging our novel adult human brain organoid system that develops extensive vascular networks and
accurately recapitulates NVU cellular interactions within a neuronal context. These adult-derived brain
organoids, developed in the previous granting period, contrast strongly with conventional avascular iPSC-derived
brain organoids. Lastly, Aim 3 investigates the translational potential of the GPR124/RECK/WNT7 pathway
through the hypothesis that agonistic GPR124 ectodomains with and without novel bioengineered FZD4
agonists, administered post-stroke, can improve outcomes in the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
stroke model. In all, this renewal application leverages substantial progress in the prior granting period to pursue
a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to GPR124/RECK/WNT7 mechanism and preclinical
translation, towards the development of BBB-targeted stroke therapeutics."
10878878,"A. Project Summary/Abstract
The goal of this renewal R01 application is to identify an 18F-labeled radiotracer to quantitatively measure
sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) expression in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. MS is associated
with a lymphocyte-mediated autoimmune response that ultimately leads to repeating cycles of demyelination
and repair. S1PR1 is extensively expressed on lymphocytes and endothelial cells and participates in this
autoimmune inflammatory process by regulating immune cell trafficking in the brain. Currently, four S1P
modulators fingolimod, siponimod, ozanimod, and ponesimod have been approved by FDA for treating MS, but
the pathophysiologic mechanism of S1PR1 in MS is still not well understood. Positron emission tomography
(PET) investigating S1PR1 function in MS and other diseases is limited by the lack of a clinically suitable
radiotracer. To address this urgent clinical need, our team successfully transferred [11C]CS1P1, a C-11 S1PR1
radiotracer into clinical investigation. Our human study data confirm that liver is the critical organ for radiation
dose absorption and that [11C]CS1P1 is safe for patient who receives a dose of up to 740 MBq (20 mCi). Our
proof of concept brain studies showed higher uptake of [11C]CS1P1 in gray matter than in white matter, consistent
with S1PR1 mRNA expression in the normal human brain. In MS patients, we observed increased [11C]CS1P1
uptake within both brain lesions and normal appearing white matter (WM). These results are consistent with
extant evidence of inflammatory infiltrate in both the brain lesions and normal appearing WM in MS. Together,
our data suggest that PET measurement of S1PR1 protein expression could provide a unique method to detect
neuroinflammation and response in MS patients. Our initial radiometabolite analysis of human plasma
discovered a lipophilic radiometabolite post injection of [11C]CS1P1 and led to initial concerns. However, we
recently confirmed the molecular structure of the radiometabolite, and radiometabolite analysis of the rat brain
and plasma post-injection of the radiotracer and PET brain studies of the F-18 labeled radiometaobolite
demonstrated the radiometabolite does not enter into the brain. Additionally, our team has synthesized ~120
new structurally diverse S1PR1 ligands, and ~30 of them are highly potent (IC50 < 20 nM) and selective for
S1PR1. To date, our preliminary data indicate that three F-18 radiotracers are promise for S1PR1 imaging, two
of them are F-18 labeled using different procedures and are anticipated to have different pathway compared to
[11C]CS1P1. Therefore, in this renewal phase, we will leverage our recent experience with [11C]CS1P1 and
develop and transfer an 18F-labeled S1PR1 tracer for clinical investigation. We propose two specific aims: 1)
Identify and transfer the most promising 18F-labeled S1PR1 tracer into human investigations. 2) Implement PET
imaging human studies in healthy controls and MS patients. When the completion of this application, a clinical
suitable S1PR1 18F-radiotracer will be identified and ready to implement for MS and other inflammatory diseases."

 The tenacious biofilms formed by Streptococcus mutans are resistant to conventional antibiotics and current
treatments such as ‘oral rinses’. Current treatments are not ‘biofilm-specific’ and kill pathogenic species as well
as commensal species alike. Therefore, there is a growing need for novel therapeutics to selectively inhibit S.
mutans biofilms while conserving the oral microenvironment. Recent studies from our lab and others’ have shown
that increased levels of cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP), an important secondary messenger in S. mutans, favored
biofilm formation by upregulating the expression of gtfB, the gene coding for glucosyl transferase B (GtfB). GtfB
is responsible for the production of water-insoluble glucans and is critical for biofilm formation and virulence of
S. mutans. C-di-AMP is a novel cyclic dinucleotide synthesized from two ATP molecules by the enzyme,
diadenylate cyclase (DAC). A suggested mechanism by which c-di-AMP controls the biofilm formation involves
a c-di-AMP-binding protein (CabPA)’s interaction with VicR, a transcriptional factor known for regulating gtfB. S.
mutans DAC (smDAC) is not an essential enzyme. Therefore, the inhibition of smDAC is a novel strategy to
inhibit the S. mutans biofilms without affecting its growth. DAC inhibition should downregulate gtfB expression
and reduce the glucan production. S. mutans coexists with other oral microbes and its ability to form biofilms
may be influenced by other bacteria. Multi-species biofilms enable the testing of the selectivity of PB8 towards
S. mutans along with other commensal streptococci. We have taken a structure-based approach for the design
of inhibitors using our recently solved crystal structure of smDAC enzyme. With the help of in-silico screening
and preliminary SAR studies, we have identified low micromolar inhibitors of smDAC. The most active compound
identified from these studies is a novel small molecule PB8, which inhibits smDAC (IC50 = 17.2 M) and S.
mutans biofilm (IC50 = 10.2 M). PB8 inhibited 80 % multi-species biofilm at 50 M. PB8 did not affect the growth
of S. mutans and commensal bacteria (S. gordonii, S. sanguinis, and S. parasanguinis) up to 100 µM showing it
is a selective biofilm inhibitor. In surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies, PB8 showed high binding affinity to
smDAC (KD = 7.1 M). To facilitate the structure activity relationship (SAR) and lead optimization studies, we
have developed a three-step high yielding synthesis of PB8 and conducted preliminary SAR studies. The overall
goal of this proposal is to optimize the biofilm inhibitory activity of PB8 and establish its binding affinity to smDAC
and its potential as novel selective biofilm inhibitor that can be used for the prevention and treatment of dental
caries. The specific aims are: 1) To optimize the biofilm inhibitory activity of PB8 through structure activity
relationship studies. Successful completion of the proposed studies will validate smDAC as a novel target for
biofilm inhibition and identify novel, non-toxic compounds that can selectively inhibit cariogenic biofilms, while
leaving the commensal and beneficial microbes intact. 2) To evaluate smDAC inhibition and biofilm inhibition
profiles of PB8 and its synthesized analogs."

Improvements in sequencing technology have spurred a tremendous increase in the use of sequencing
to answer a wide range of questions in biology and medicine. Thousands of new human genomes are
being sequenced each year in efforts to track down the genetic causes of human diseases. In parallel
with this increase in whole-genome sequencing, RNA sequencing has also exploded in popularity, due
to its power to characterize gene expression in a multitude of cell types and conditions, and to its
potential to discover new genes and new splice variants. These enormous data sets require highly
efficient and accurate computational methods for analysis, and they also presents opportunities for
discovery. Furthermore, to properly analyze the many diverse humans being sequenced, we can no
longer afford to rely on a single reference genome that is missing much of the variation found in the
human population, and that makes it very difficult to analyze sequences that do not match the
reference. We propose to address these challenges in four specific ways: first, we will develop new and
improved assembly algorithms that take advantage of the latest long-read technology to create
genomes of unprecedented contiguity and completeness. This effort will include a method for creating
haplotype-resolved assemblies when sequences from both parents are available, and a method to use
an existing reference genome to create a highly contiguous assembly at minimal cost. Second, we will
apply these methods to build new human reference genomes, assembled and annotated as thoroughly
as the current human reference. These genomes, each representing a single individual, can then serve
as the basis for many future studies of the relevant populations. Third, in the area of RNA-seq
analysis our lab has previously developed two widely-used spliced aligners, TopHat and HISAT, and
two equally popular transcriptome assemblers, Cufflinks and StringTie, which now have many
thousands of users. We will extend and improve the StringTie algorithm, augmenting its novel
network flow algorithm with de novo assembly plus new alignment methods to handle long reads and
to improve its construction and quantification of transcripts. Fourth, we propose to systematically
assemble thousands of RNA-seq experiments to discover new genes and to re-build the human gene
catalog, an effort that could have a major impact on a broad array of human genetic and genomic
studies. We have recently released our first version of this effort as CHESS, a human gene catalog
built from a massive RNA-seq database that represents a comprehensive, reproducible, and open
method for annotating the human genome. The CHESS database already agrees more closely with the
two most widely-used human gene databases than either of them agree with one another, and we will
improve it further so that it can provide a basis for biomedical research for many years to come."

This Academic-Industry Partnership, AIP, proposal (PAR-18-009) will develop and evaluate an innovative
multi-modality breast imaging platform that performs simultaneous Microwave and Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (sMMRI). It incorporates a multiple-principal-investigator (multi-PI) research plan and AIP governance
structure that leverages expertise from Dartmouth, Dartmouth-Hitchcock, and Quality Electrodynamics (QED)
in biomedical engineering, MRI and microwave physics, computational inversion and estimation, and breast
radiology. Industry partner QED will apply its extensive experience in design and implementation of specialized
MRI coils that will be fully integrated and compatible with Dartmouth’s microwave imaging (MI) electronics and
in-bore antenna array. To date, we have demonstrated technical feasibility of sMMRI and have realized a
prototype that has delivered the first successful clinical breast exams. While potential promise of sMMRI has
been suggested, especially in terms of acquiring quantitatively-accurate spatial maps of tissue electrical
properties (i.e. permittivity and conductivity), further technical innovations are needed and more experience
with sMMRI, both technically and clinically, is required to develop the technology sufficiently for a full clinical
evaluation. To advance and optimize sMMRI of the breast while also increasing our understanding of its clinical
potential, we propose to (1) develop and integrate MRI (receive) coils with MI antenna arrays to optimize MRI
and MI image quality, and breast coverage during an sMMRI clinical breast exam, (2) estimate breast tissue
electrical properties from sMMRI data by encoding MRI anatomical priors into the 3D reconstruction process,
and (3) complete phantom and clinical breast imaging experiments with sMMRI to evaluate and optimize the
proposed technical developments, and to conduct a clinical study in women with undiagnosed breast
abnormalities to test the hypothesis that sMMRI improves the specificity of breast MR alone. If the studies we
propose are successful, we will have realized an innovative multi-modality breast imaging platform that is ready
for involvement in larger statistically-powered clinical studies of its diagnostic performance in the future."

10813838,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 This K99/R00 proposal seeks to expand the space of druggable protein targets through the
development of novel analytical technology that will guide the design of next-generation, non-
Lipinski molecular therapeutics and diagnostics. Cyclic peptides, which are not drug-like (i.e., Lipinski-
like), hold great promise for addressing undruggable targets, especially protein-protein interactions (PPIs).
However, the larger molecular mass and more complex secondary structures result in unpredictable and almost
always low cell permeation, significantly blunting their utility as drug candidates and even as preclinical tool
compounds in cells. Rarely, a cyclic peptide will exhibit anomalously high permeation. However, insufficient data
exist to uncover the rules dictating permeation because high-throughput measurements of cell permeation
simply do not exist. In this proposal, a high-throughput in vitro permeation assay compatible with DNA-encoded
combinatorial library (DEL) screening will be developed and miniaturized to the microfluidic droplet scale. The
permeation assay will be applied to screen DELs to identify the species that efficiently permeate membrane
bilayers. The permeable macrocycle hits will be further validated in a cell-based permeation assay that will also
be developed in the project. The large screening data sets will reveal relationships between permeability and
structure, especially for molecules of beyond the Rule of 5 (bRo5), which will be further analyzed using machine
learning. With these and other empirically derived models of macrocyclic peptide pharmacokinetic properties in
hand, we may finally be able to move such non-Lipinski molecules from the lab to the clinic at scale. This proposal
will significantly enhance the PI’s career development and advance her toward her career goal of becoming an
independent investigator at a research-focused institution. The proposed project provides training in cutting-
edge research skills, including cell-based assay development and high-content imaging, DEL design, synthesis
and screening technology development, and machine learning techniques. UC Irvine provides an ideal
environment for academic training, with world-renowned experts in medicinal and computational chemistry,
chemical biology and microfluidics engineering. In addition, UCI provides an intellectual environment that
encourages collaboration and cooperation, enabling the candidate’s growth as a member of the scientific
community. Indeed, the PI will engage in activities designed to achieve independence, including training in lab
management and grantsmanship, networking, and preparation for the academic job market. In summary, the
proposed plan will enable the PI’s scientific and career-wise growth and independence, further positioning her
to attain future R01 funding."

 The prevalence of anxiety and depression are high among adolescents. COVID-19-related stressors have
increases rates of internalizing disorders and risk for suicide, especially among ethnic minority adolescents
who have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. Although evidence-based interventions are
effective, the vast majority ethnic minority adolescents do not access any MH care. School-based MH services
can address common barriers to care such as cost and transportation. However, even with access to school-
based MH services, capacity can be highly limited in schools, and some adolescents may be reticent to seek
services at school due to concerns about privacy, judgment, and academic disruption. Innovative approaches
to provide accessible, low-cost, evidence-based MH care to minority youth are urgently needed. Technology
creates an opportunity to treat youth in need of MH services and could expand the reach of school health
services. Despite the potential impact of digital care, to date there are no studies examining whether digital
mental health interventions improve service access for vulnerable youth served by school-based mental health
services. Consistent with NIMH Notice of Information MH-18-031 designating digital health technology as a
priority, this application proposes to determine the feasibility and acceptability of delivering SilverCloud, a
clinician-guided, empirically-supported, app-based, CBT program to vulnerable adolescents through school-
based health centers (SBHCs). In contrast to most MH apps, SilverCloud has demonstrated strong
engagement and medium-to-large effect sizes. Its features, including personalized feedback, stories from
relatable peers, and routine outcome assessment, directly promote engagement. This would be the first trial to
evaluate SilverCloud as a school-based intervention and refine it to meet the needs of low income, ethnic/racial
minority youth. We propose a four-phase study conducted at two diverse, public schools in Brooklyn. In Phase
I, participants who endorse internalizing symptoms (n=20) during routine MH screening at the SBHC will
participate in an open trial of SilverCloud. In Phase II, open trial participants will provide feedback that will be
used to refine the SilverCloud program. In Phase III participants will be screened (PHQ-9/GAD-7). Those who
endorse symptoms will be randomized (N=100) to SilverCloud or treatment as usual (TAU). Outcomes will be
evaluated each semester. In Phase IV, participant and stakeholder feedback will be collected systematically to
further inform program adaptations and implementation strategy refinement for a large effectiveness trial.
Primary aims are to establish the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of SilverCloud among
minority youth served through SBHCs and to examine whether SilverCloud changes engagement (i.e.,
initiation, dose) and clinical (i.e., emotion regulation, negative cognitions, coping skills, behavioral activation)
targets, and whether changes are associated with clinical benefit (i.e., reduction in depression and anxiety)."
10827513,"Project Abstract
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a non-invasive technique for mapping brain activity, has been
widely used in cognitive neuroscience and patient care. Magnetic field inhomogeneities (B) around tissue
interfaces can induce severe geometric distortions in specific brain regions in fMRI images. The image distortions
lead to errors in the registration between fMRI and high-resolution anatomical MRI images, and thus decrease
spatial accuracy and sensitivity of detecting brain activity with fMRI. In present fMRI studies, B-induced
distortions are typically corrected in the reconstructed magnitude images using methods based on image
registration, which assume a smoothly varying B. However, the registration-based correction (Reg-Corr) can
cause image artifacts and blurring because its assumption breaks down in brain regions where B changes
rapidly and omission of phase information in the magnitude images can exacerbate calculation errors. The
overarching goal of this project is to develop a novel approach based on deep learning (DL) to accurately correct
for geometric distortions through image reconstruction. By integrating the physical model of B effects into an
unrolling DL network, distortion-free fMRI images will be directly reconstructed from the complex MR signal in k-
space, without the assumption about the smoothness of B. The proposed reconstruction-based correction
(Recon-Corr) algorithm will be trained and tested with raw k-space data from 4050 fMRI scans, in the Acute to
Chronic Pain Signatures (A2CPS) consortium, in which the University of Illinois at Chicago is a primary
performing site. The project has two specific aims: (1) To develop a physics-guided DL algorithm for
simultaneous fMRI image reconstruction and distortion correction; (2) To systematically compare the
performance of Recon-Corr and traditional Reg-Corr methods. By developing the Recon-Corr method and
leveraging the large A2CPS fMRI k-space database, this project will demonstrate an accurate method for fMRI
distortion correction that can offer better registration accuracy of functional and anatomical MRI images.
Successful completion of the project will resolve a long-standing and important problem in fMRI (i.e., image
distortion), contributing to fMRI applications in neuroscience, patient care, and other research areas."

outcomes and many AI models have been developed for improving outcomes related to pediatric. However,
there is little high-quality evidence of improved patient outcomes in clinical studies and there are studies with
conflicting outcomes related to AI interventions. Current real-world evaluations only measure predictive
performance of the models, but do not provide insight into factors contributing to success/ failure of AI
interventions. While human centered evaluations were done previously in laboratory settings and in
simulations, we are not aware of any real-world evaluations in acute care settings. The goal of this proposal is
to measure implementation outcomes and establish the feasibility of measuring the mechanism of impact via
human performance aspects such as trust, situational awareness, and workload. In aim 1 of the project, we will
evaluate the implementation of an existing pediatric AI sepsis model in the pediatric emergency department. In
aim 2 we will demonstrate the feasibility of measuring the influence of sepsis AI on human performance in a
real-world acute care setting. This project will use a combination of interview methods and electronic health
record data to demonstrate the feasibility of measuring human performance. Demonstrating feasibility will
provide preliminary data for a subsequent hybrid implementation trial of sepsis AI interventions in acute care
settings. This line of study will ultimately yield insights to harness AI technology for improving acute and critical
illness outcomes."

The burden of influenza remains high, with seasonal epidemics resulting in 3-5 million cases of severe illness
globally and ~650,000 fatalities/year. While immunity to influenza virus acquired through natural infection is
relatively broad and long-lived, immune responses induced through vaccination with current vaccines are short-
lived and narrow, requiring annual reformulation and revaccination. It is unclear what causes such dissimilarities
between infection- and vaccine-induced immunity, however major differences include route of exposure
(respiratory vs. parenteral), antigen type (live vs. inactivated virus/protein), and the robust activation of viral-
specific innate immune responses during infection. Current influenza vaccines elicit immune responses primarily
directed towards epitopes in the highly variable immunodominant head domain of the viral hemagglutinin (HA).
While antibodies directed towards the more conserved HA stalk domain provide cross-strain protection, this
domain is poorly immunogenic. HA head dominance compounded with the rapid pace of antigenic drift severely
limits cross-protection. Broad-based cellular immunity and mucosal immunity are also key to heterosubtypic
protection, however current parenteral vaccines do not induce these sufficiently. Thus, development of more
effective adjuvants and vaccination strategies targeting the mucosal route are clearly needed. Natural infection
with influenza virus stimulates strong adaptive immune responses through activation of Toll-, RIG-I-, and NOD-
like receptors (TLRs, RLRs, NLRs). As induction of appropriate innate responses is crucial for long-lasting
adaptive immunity and for shaping the correct types of immune responses, we will employ a rationally designed
intranasal combination adjuvant to activate all three pathways through the mucosal route to more closely mimic
natural infection, which we hypothesize will lead to more robust and durable vaccine responses. This adjuvant
consists of a nanoemulsion adjuvant (NE) that activates TLRs and NLRP3 and an RNA agonist of RIG-I derived
from the defective interfering RNA of Sendai virus (IVT). NE/IVT induces synergistic immune responses against
a variety of viral antigens, with magnified TH1-biased cellular immunity and mucosal immune responses. Here,
we will compare this adjuvant to two adjuvants licensed for parenteral vaccination with influenza vaccines (AS03
and MF59) to improve immune responses to two different antigen systems that have broadened heterosubtypic
protection in preclinical and clinical settings: (1) a sequential regimen utilizing split viruses containing chimeric
HAs with different “exotic” avian HA head domains all with the same stalk domain to guide immune responses
to epitopes in the stalk, and (2) a recombinant tetrameric neuraminidase. Human immune responses to influenza
vaccines are heavily influenced by pre-existing immunity acquired through past infections and/or immunizations.
We will further determine whether the immune responses driven by mucosal administration of NE/IVT with these
antigen systems can better take advantage of such pre-existing immune responses compared to parenteral
vaccination with AS03 by redirecting memory responses to more conserved epitopes."

Tracking living cells in video sequences is a fundamental task in many fields of science,
including biochemistry, bioinformatics, cell biology, and genetics. Manually linking cells is
extremely time-consuming and not feasible in large-scale analysis. Automatic approaches can
compute cell links by measuring how close two instances of a cell are, or how similar they look.
These techniques work well with video acquired at a relatively high frame rate, but,
unfortunately, acquiring images at high frame rates affects cells negatively. Too frequent
imaging not only causes phototoxicity, leading to experimental artifacts, but also
photobleaching, leading to the inability to measure quantities of interest over time. In addition,
during image acquisition, the environment temperature and air quality are typically less
controlled, which could also contribute to cytotoxicity. Moreover, when performing high-
throughput live-cell imaging, the lower the acquisition rate, the more cells/plates can be imaged,
and, consequently, the more experimental treatments can be applied and studied.
If reducing the acquisition rate is beneficial for all these reasons, it severely affects the accuracy
of cell tracking algorithms. To this end, we propose a new class of cell tracking approaches based
on cell movement predictions. Instead of comparing cells based on their similarity, we propose
to predict where every cell will move in the next frame. This will allow for searching the
occurrence of such cells, even if the next frame was acquired after an extended period. The
new approach will be investigated using a newly generated dataset for low frame rate cell
tracking (Aim 1). Cell displacement will be predicted by using a new Recurrent Neural Network
designed for the task (Aim 2). Cell tracking algorithms will be defined re-evaluating existing
approaches under low-frame rate constraints when using cell displacement information (Aim
3).
While current approaches require image acquisition to occur at least every 5-15 minutes, we
will investigate the feasibility of cell tracking on images acquired at intervals of up to 2 hours. If
successful, our research will allow to accurately track cells in low frame rate video sequences
without the need for specialized tools or equipment."

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver pathology worldwide and is estimated to affect
nearly 30% of the population. Rather than a single disorder, NAFLD refers to a spectrum of conditions that are
characterized by excessive fat accumulation in the liver (hepatic steatosis) that occurs independently of
excessive alcohol ingestion. With increased hepatocyte injury and inflammation, hepatic steatosis can progress
to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), followed by cirrhosis and fibrosis which lead to increased risk for
developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although hepatic steatosis can be reversed in early NAFLD with
weight loss, diet, and exercise, liver damage resulting from inflammation, cirrhosis, and fibrosis observed in
advanced NAFLD is often deemed irreversible. Therefore, there is a critical need to identify molecular
mechanisms contributing to NALFD etiology and progression to identify therapeutic targets before the disease
becomes clinically unmanageable. While several factors are known to contribute to the onset and progression
of NAFLD-related disorders, aging is one of the highest risk factors. However, the mechanism underlying age-
associated NAFLD remain incompletely understood. HUWE1 is a HECT-domain ubiquitin E3 ligase ubiquitously
expressed in normal tissues. HUWE1 ubiquitinates a wide range of cellular substrates, including p53, MYC, and
MCL1. Given the diverse substrates, the in vivo role of HUWE1 in human disease remains elusive. We have
recently identified that HUWE1 is a critical mediator of NAFLD etiology as liver-specific Huwe1 knockout
rendered mice protected against hepatic steatosis induced by age. Our novel data suggest that dysregulation of
hepatic HUWE1 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of age-associated NAFLD. To test this
hypothesis, we will identify the mechanism of how HUWE1 promotes age-associated NAFLD (Aim 1) and identify
the substrate of HUWE1 that prevents the disease in mice (Aim 2). The successful completion of the proposed
study will establish HUWE1 as a key regulator of age-associated NAFLD. This outcome will have a durable
impact in the field since it will uncover a signaling pathway previously unrecognized and provide a rationale for
investigating the mechanism of HUWE1 regulation in aging hepatocytes."

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has been the leading cause of infectious disease mortality worldwide for the
past few decades with more than 1 million deaths annually. This pathogen has an exceptionally complex cell
wall structure, the outer components of which are important for direct interactions with the host, for giving
structural support and maintaining a hydrophobic barrier for small molecules and antibiotics. Phthiocerol
dimycocerosate (PDIM) is a lipid found in the outer-most layer of the Mtb cell envelope. PDIMs form a
permeability barrier, protecting the bacteria from antimicrobial compounds, and are important virulence factors
for defense against the host immune system.
Paradoxically, despite these important functions, PDIM is dispensable in vitro and its loss confers a growth
advantage leading to the selection of spontaneously occurring PDIM negative clones in laboratory cultures. This
affects experimental reliability, reproducibly and the interpretation of results. PDIM loss leads to reduced cell wall
permeability and virulence attenuation, producing misleading results in infection experiments, drug susceptibility
testing and genetic manipulations. To remove PDIM bias from TB research, and to study PDIMs role in
pathogenesis and drug tolerance, we need appropriate screening and selection tools.
 In this grant application we will build on powerful new preliminary results to develop robust PDIM
selection, screening and cleanup protocols, determine the propensity of PDIM loss in different Mtb strains and
its impact on virulence, and aim to study how PDIM population heterogeneity and propionate metabolism impact
infectivity and antibiotic persistence."

The primary objective of this application is to investigate siderophore-based immunization and antibiotic
delivery strategies designed to inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli and non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS). These
Gram-negative facultative anaerobic bacteria are major causes of infections in diverse patient populations. E.
coli includes commensal organisms, pathogens, and pathobionts (organisms that are usually harmless but are
pathogenic in some settings) and cause infections that include urinary tract infections (UTI), bacteremia,
meningitis, and sepsis. Moreover, a pathovar known as adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) is commonly isolated
from patients with Crohn’s disease, a form of inflammatory bowel disease. NTS, including Salmonella enterica
serovar Typhimurium (STm), are major causes of inflammatory diarrhea. The primary site of E. coli and NTS
colonization is the gastrointestinal tract, where these organisms thrive during colitis and disseminate to other
body sites. Recent studies, including work from our laboratories, demonstrate that iron (Fe) availability is a key
factor for the progression of E. coli and NTS colonization in the gut, motivating the research proposed in this
grant application. Our central hypothesis is that targeting siderophores and their uptake machineries can limit
enteric pathogen growth in vitro and in vivo. Both E. coli and NTS deploy the catecholate siderophores
enterobactin (Ent) and salmochelin (DGE, diglucosylated enterobactin) in the gut to scavenge Fe3+ from the host.
We propose that blocking Ent&DGE-mediated Fe3+ acquisition by bacterial pathogens or targeting Ent&DGE
transport systems to deliver antibiotics will provide a means to inhibit the growth of STm and AIEC in the inflamed
gut. In support of this notion, we developed a siderophore-based immunization based on Ent that inhibits STm
and AIEC growth in the murine gut, and we synthesized and evaluated siderophore-antibiotic conjugates (SACs)
based on the Ent&DGE scaffold that target E. coli and STm. In Aim 1, we will use mutants in Fe acquisition
genes in STm and AIEC to test whether CTB-Ent immunization results in specific inhibition of pathogen growth
and association with the gut mucosa when the pathogen produces Ent&DGE; determine the effect of CTB-Ent
immunization on the mucosal-associated versus luminal microbiota; and ascertain whether neutralizing anti-
Ent&DGE Ig mediate protection by limiting pathogen association with the mucosa. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the
antimicrobial activity of three Ent&DGE-based SACs. Studies in vitro will largely focus on how key environmental
variables that characterize diverse host environments affect the antimicrobial activity of SACs, whereas studies
in vivo will evaluate the consequences of SAC administration on the gut microbiome composition as well as on
inhibiting mucosal expansion of STm and AIEC during colitis. This work may lead to future development of
siderophore-binding antibodies and SACs as therapeutics to limit colonization of enteric pathogens and
pathobionts in the inflamed gut."

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) represent a group of highly aggressive soft tissue
sarcomas that occur in distinct clinical settings: neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1)-associated (45%), sporadic (45%) or
radiotherapy (RT)-associated (10%). MPNSTs metastasize early and are resistant to radiotherapy and systemic
chemotherapy and have poor prognosis. Irrespective of the clinical settings, MPNSTs share the same molecular
pathway inactivation in NF1 (>90%, hence NF1-deficient), Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), and
CDKN2A through biallelic genetic alterations, suggesting that they can be molecularly targeted similarly. NF1-
deficient plexiform neurofibroma responds well to MEK inhibitor (MEKi) treatment clinically; however, NF1-
deficeint MPNSTs arising from plexiform neurofibromas are universally resistant to MEKi, suggesting intrinsic
resistance in the more aggressive form of peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Using MPNST patient tumor samples
and preclinical MPNST models, we have uncovered that PRC2-loss leads to PDGRA upregulation; MEKi
treatment resulted in feedback upregulation of PDGFRB irrespective of the PRC2 status. The convergence of
the PDGFR pathway activation by different mechanisms points to a novel therapeutic opportunity to target the
PDGFR pathway to overcome MEKi resistance in MPNST. Combination of a novel PDGFRA/B inhibitor, ripretinib
with a MEKi leads to synergistic growth inhibition of MPNST in vitro and in vivo. We hypothesize that
PDGFRA/B pathway activation represent a central resistance mechanism to MEKi and combined
targeting of the PDGFR and MAPK pathways with ripretinib (pan-PDGFRA/B inhibitor) and binimetinib
(MEKi) may present an effective therapeutic strategy in NF1-deficient MPNST.
Here, we propose to investigate the tumor heterogeneity and cellular plasticity involved in tumor evolution and
adaptive resistance to binimetinib and combination of ripretinib and binimetinib, using well-defined preclinical
MPNST in vitro and in vivo model systems and single-cell analysis including single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq)
and a novel barcoding system. Additionally, we propose a collaborative clinical investigation between CCR/NCI
(Drs. Widemann/Shern) and MSKCC (Dr. Chi) to conduct a proof-of-concept phase I/II study of the combination
of ripretinib and binimetinib in patients with NF1-deficient MPNST. In this trial, we will assess and optimize the
evaluation of MAPK pathway inhibition to the ripretinib/binimetinib combination therapy using traditional ERK
phosphorylation and newly established custom Pea3-family ETS-regulated MAPK signature. Further, we will
also investigate the tumor heterogeneity and cellular plasticity in tumor evolution and resistance mechanisms to
the ripretinib/binimetinib combination using targeted NGS, scRNA-seq and integrative analysis. The proposal
leverages the synergistic expertise and resources at MSKCC and CCR/NCI. We believe that these studies will
generate mechanistic insight of therapeutic resistance and provide the pivotal clinical and translational
information for future definitive trials, with the potential to change the clinical practice in MPNST."

vascular pathways in neurodegenerative disorders in order to improve early diagnoses and
development of disease-modifying treatments that will alter the cognitive trajectory of so many
individuals affected with vascular disease and at risk of dementia. In order to achieve this goal, Dr. Elahi
seeks additional training to develop her knowledge and skills in two major domains: (1) leadership in medicine,
by starting a specialized clinic at the VA and UCSF, to evaluate veterans with VCID from a variety of causes,
high systemic vascular disease / risk, strokes, TBI, auto-immune disease, and neurodegenerative disease and
to undertake their enrollment into research, (2) advancement of her scientific skills in multi-modal data-driven
analytical approaches for unbiased biomarker discovery.
 To better understand VCID, we need novel tools that can handle both the complexity of human disease
as well as the noisy nature of human-based biological and clinical data. Thus, novel approaches and methods
are needed. As a physician-scientist, Dr. Elahi is uniquely suited to pursue cutting-edge approaches to
advancement of diagnostics in VCID. However, with clinical training and responsibilities, she has not had the
opportunity to acquire adequate knowledge of unbiased biomarker discovery projects, nor the important
opportunity to develop her skills in advanced data-driven analytics.
 In this application, Dr. Elahi proposes to use her clinical expertise in neurodegenerative disease and
technical expertise in exosomal technologies to undertake hypothesis-driven modelling of contributions of
endothelial inflammation and pathogenic angiogenesis to adverse clinical and radiographic brain outcomes in
VCID (Aims 1 and 2). While in Aim 3, in collaboration with her VA mentor, Dr. Ferguson, she will for the first
time undertake the analysis of multi-dimensional data, including exosomal proteomics, brain imaging, retinal
imaging, clinical variables and cognitive scores. The scope of the work proposed is aligned with Dr. Elahi’s
goal of becoming a leader in translational VCID research. The hypothesis and data-driven aims will provide
complimentary approaches to cutting-edge research in the field of neurodegenerative disease. This Aim will
provide the opportunity to undertake data-driven discovery of discrete clinical-biomarker endophenotypes
within a heterogenous cohort of subjects.
 This research is expected to advance understanding of VCID with diagnostic and therapeutic relevance
and prepare Dr. Elahi for leadership in precision medicine approaches in VCID research. To ensure success of
the scientific and training goals of this work, Dr. Elahi has assembled a world-class team of leaders in vascular
neurology and neuroscience (Swanson), neurodegenerative disease (Miller), data science in neurological
disease (Ferguson), and advisors/collaborators in: epidemiology of vulnerable populations and causal
inference (Glymour), mutli-modal neuroimaging (Rosen), and cognition in VCID (Kramer). Dr. Elahi’s training
will involve a combination of individual tutorials with her mentors and scientific advisors, hands-on experience,
and formal coursework. The proposed research will provide Dr. Elahi with data for a larger prospective study of
microvascular disease in the veteran population with heterogenous etiologies: chronic and acute CVD related
to systemic vascular risk, TBI, and auto-immune/inflammatory disorders. She will propose a Merit Review
application submitted before the end of the CDA period. Dr. Elahi is enthusiastically committed to improving the
cognitive and mental health of Veterans through research, and with her proposed project and training, she will

In heart disease, the amount of blood pumped by the heart is not sufficient to supply the metabolic demands of
the body. Current positive inotropes (dobutamine, milrinone) increase cardiac contraction by elevating the
intracellular calcium contractile signal, however trials have demonstrated this elevated intracellular calcium also
causes detrimental arrhythmia, impaired relaxation, and increased mortality rendering this inotropic approach
unsuccessful as a long-term therapy. There are currently no approved therapies that directly increase the
insufficient function of the heart in disease without long-term detrimental effects. The myofilament protein
troponin I (TnI) is critical to relay the calcium activating signal into muscle contraction and is therefore a key
regulator of in vivo cardiac muscle function. We have shown the site-specific phosphorylation of TnI increases
cardiac muscle contraction without elevating intracellular calcium. Our preliminary data now demonstrates this
TnI phosphorylation increases in vivo cardiac function in both normal and diseased hearts without long-term
detrimental effects. This proposal will establish the novel effects and mechanism of this TnI site-specific
phosphorylation to improve in vivo cardiac function in the normal and diseased mouse heart. We will further
establish the effects and safety of this site-specific TnI phosphorylation on human cardiac tissue towards
establishing this phosphorylation as a future therapeutic approach in human heart disease."

The vast majority of cancer mortality is due to metastases. A major unmet need in oncology is how to predict
and prevent metastatic progression. To address this need, it is imperative we advance our understanding of how
tumor cells acquire metastatic capability. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a normal physiologic
process in wound healing and development by which polarized epithelial cells undergo biochemical, metabolic,
and epigenetic changes and convert to a mesenchymal phenotype, characterized by enhanced migratory and
invasive capacity. Cancers co-opt this reprogramming to acquire metastatic ability. Understanding how tumor
cells undergo EMT is critical to unraveling how cancer becomes metastatic. Historically, studies have primarily
focused on genetic mutations or gene expression changes that trigger EMT and metastasis. But recent work has
suggested that non-genetic factors such as metabolites can promote cancer progression, suggesting unexplored
areas of cancer biology. To gain a deeper understanding of EMT and capture the sequential changes necessary
for cancer to become metastatic, we performed proteomics, metabolomics and transcriptomics at multiple time
points as cells underwent EMT. Our multifaceted approach revealed rich new insights. We found that propionate
metabolism was dysregulated during EMT. Indeed, we observed increased propionyl-CoA and methylmalonic
acid (MMA), a dicarboxylic acid by-product of propionate metabolism, during early EMT. To test the functional
effect of elevated MMA, we treated lung and breast cancer cells with MMA. Strikingly, we found that MMA
triggered EMT and enhanced migratory and invasive capacity. Prior to our discovery, little was known about
propionate metabolism and MMA other than propionate metabolism is dysregulated in rare inborn errors of
metabolism collectively referred to as “methylmalonic acidemias.” Some recent studies have also shown that
MMA increases in serum with age and is linked to age-related, all-cause mortality. To our knowledge, our findings
are the first to demonstrate that propionate metabolism plays a role in EMT and cancer cell progression. This
led us to study how propionate metabolism is altered during EMT. Our long-term goals are to define how this
pathway is regulated by multiple inducers of metastasis and at multiple points in the pathway, and to define how
MMA produced by cancer cells can also influence the tumor microenvironment. Our proposed studies will
address a critical need for a greater understanding of the molecular basis of metastasis. Our expectations are
that successful completion of the proposed work will impact cancer biology by shifting the paradigm and
highlighting critical non-genetic factors that drive cancer progression. Consequently, our work will identify new
biomarkers and therapeutic targets that can be exploited to prevent and inhibit metastases."

The exact mechanisms by which light stroking and deep pressure – components of massage therapy – induce
pleasantness and pain modulation are not understood. Given the frequent use of massage therapy for relaxation
and pain relief, and the need for complementary tools for chronic pain, there is a critical need to study the
mechanisms of specific forms of affective touch. Our long-term goal is to elucidate the mechanisms by which
manual therapies induce pleasant relaxation and pain relief. Our overall objectives in this application are to (1)
Determine the extent to which A- and C-fibers contribute to affective effects of gentle stroking, 2) Determine the
extent to which A- and C-fibers contribute to affective effects of deep pressure, and 3) Determine the contribution
of C-fibers to neural mechanisms of touch-induced pleasantness and pain modulation. We will also (Exploratory)
use machine learning to identify individual contributions of C-tactile (CT) fibers to neural mechanisms of touch
pleasantness and pain modulation, and the association of interoceptive sensibility with CT effects. Our central
hypothesis is that A-fibers are necessary but not sufficient for the pleasantness of gentle stroking and
unnecessary for its pain reduction, but are necessary and sufficient for the pleasantness and pain reduction of
deep pressure. Further, we hypothesize that left anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex activation will predict
CT contributions to modulation of pain by touch. We will conduct a two session within-subject study in healthy
adult volunteers to test the effects of A- and C-fiber blockade on the pleasantness and pain modulation induced
by slow stroking (N = 24) and deep pressure (N = 24). We will then test effects of A-fiber blockade on brain
mechanisms of pain modulation during fMRI, and relationships between CT contributions and touch
pleasantness, pain modulation, and interoceptive sensibility (N = 36). Effects of CT inputs on heart rate variability
will comprise a secondary outcome. Upon successful completion of the proposed research, we expect to have
identified the role of A- and C-fibers in the pathways and major effects of affective touch. This contribution is
expected to be significant because it will define the pathways for two major forms of affective touch and their
effects on pain, providing reliable information about non-invasive measures for pain control and potential targets
for noninvasive neuromodulation of pain. Further, this project is innovative because it explores a novel affective
touch pathway, applies a novel method to causally test afferent pathways for affective touch, and uses machine
learning to explore individual differences in the contributions of CTs to neural mechanisms for affective touch.
Our proposed project seeks to elucidate pathways for two major forms of affective touch commonly engaged by
massage. This research will have a positive impact by opening new horizons for mechanistic research on effects
of touch in health and disease, and may provide targets for neuromodulation in the treatment of pain."
10783089,"It is appreciated that the high prevalence of asthma over the last decades reflects the interaction of susceptibility
genes in affected individuals with environmental and social changes ushered by modernity [1]. A key feature of
asthma is chronic airway inflammation driven and/or exacerbated by ongoing exposure to allergens and
pollutants, most notably ambient particulate matter (PMs). The persistence of such inflammation suggests the
derailment of normative countervailing immune regulatory mechanisms that would otherwise limit its scope. In
that regard, we have identified Notch4 expression in lung regulatory T (TR) cells as a key mechanism that disrupts
lung tissue homeostatic immune regulation to promote allergic airway inflammation. Notch4 is upregulated by
IL-6 signaling in TR cells to activate downstream intermediates including the Wnt and Hippo pathways to promote
airway Th2 and Th17 immune responses, respectively. Notch4 expression is augmented by PM, which act to
induce the expression of the Notch receptor ligand Jag1 in alveolar macrophages as well as the production of
IL-6. Finally, Notch4 is also upregulated on lung TR cells in the context of viral infections, thus providing a potential
link between viral infections and exacerbation of allergic airway inflammation. Accordingly, our central hypothesis
is that Notch4 signaling in TR cells integrates cues by allergens, pollutants and viruses to license tissue allergic
inflammation. To address this hypothesis, we propose under Aim 1 to investigate the mechanisms by which
Notch4 subverts TR cell function to promote allergic airway inflammation. We will investigate the role of the
Notch4-activated Hippo pathway in TR cell destabilization, leading to the generation of tissue resident ex-TR cells
that promote airway inflammation. We will also investigate the role of the Wnt pathway downstream of Notch4 in
driving Th2 pathology, as well as the interaction of Notch4 with environmental inputs such as PMs of different
sources and physiochemical properties to promote airway inflammation. We further propose under Aim 2 to
investigate the role of Growth and Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) as a cytokine produced by lung TR cells in
a Notch4-Wnt pathway-dependent manner that may contribute to tissue inflammation and pathology by acting
via its receptor GFRAL on ILC2 to drive their activation and expansion. The relationship between TR cell Notch4,
GDF15, IL-6 and BMI will be explored in a cohort of asthmatic subjects. Finally, under Aim 3 we will examine
the role of TR cell-intrinsic viral sensing pathways alone and in synergy with Notch4 in promoting virus and
allergen-induced inflammation. Our studies will help elucidate novel mechanisms fundamental to the biology of
allergic airway inflammation and its augmentation by pollutants, obesity and viral infections."

 Drug addiction can be characterized as a chronic reoccurring illness. The relapse rate of alcoholism is
particularly high (75-95%). It has been hypothesized that drug craving is a critical precipitating factor to
relapse and drug craving is influenced by the amount of time abstinent, the exposure to the drug-paired
environment, or drug-paired cues. Convergent data in rodents and humans have indicated that drug-paired
environment or drug-paired cues' ability to elicit drug-craving intensifies with the passage of time during
early abstinence, which can be referred to as ‘cue incubation of drug craving’. The serotonin (5-HT) system
is thought to play a role in the development of alcohol addiction as well as play an important role in the
control of drug-seeking and sensitivity to drug reward and drug cues. The 5-HT7 receptor has been
researched as a potential therapeutic target for various conditions such as anxiety, depression, neuropathic
pain, Alzheimer’s disease, and drug addiction. The activation of 5-HT7 receptors can regulate ‘behavior
control,’ drug-withdrawal symptoms, and cognitive behaviors. However, there is a gap in knowledge of the
involvement of the 5-HT7 receptor in mediating alcohol (EtOH)-seeking behaviors. Extensive preliminary
data conducted in our laboratory have indicated that the systemic and site-specific, specifically in the
nucleus accumbens shell (AcbSh), pharmacological manipulation of 5-HT7 receptor bidirectionally mediates
context- and cue-induced EtOH-seeking. There is a critical need for therapeutic treatments for EtOH-
seeking behaviors and we propose that the 5-HT7 receptors need to be further researched as potential
targets for treatments of alcohol ‘craving’ behaviors. Understanding 5-HT7 mechanisms contributing to the
‘incubation’ of cue-induced EtOH-seeking is very important for developing strategies to reduce or prevent
relapse. The Pavlovian Spontaneous Recovery (PSR) model of EtOH seeking, pharmacological techniques,
and viral vectors will be used to examine the temporal effects of ‘incubation’ of cue-induced EtOH-seeking
behaviors and determine 5-HT7 receptors' involvement in regulating these behaviors. Western blot
techniques will be used to examine cellular mechanisms in ‘behavioral control’ neural circuitry and the
alterations of 5-HT7 receptors expression. Microdialysis and pharmacological techniques will be used to
examine the involvement of 5-HT7 receptors' effects on DA and 5-HT release within the AcbSh associated
with temporal aspects of ‘incubation’ of cue-induced EtOH-seeking. Therefore, we propose to test the
hypothesis that 5-HT7 receptors mediate the incubation’ of cue-induced EtOH-seeking during abstinence by
regulating extracellular levels of DA and 5-HT in the AcbSh and that this response is mediated by the
regulation of 5HT7 receptor expression in the AcbSh dorsal raphe circuit."

Cochlear implant (CI) electrode arrays are made of platinum wires and contacts encased in a silastic housing.
These materials provide mechanical stability and flexibility critical to the long-term function of the CI. However,
they also induce local tissue reactions that can have detrimental effects. For example, trauma from insertion of
the CI can damage cochlear health and any residual acoustic hearing. Further, the fibrotic capsule that
encases CI electrode arrays leads to increased impedances and decreased signal resolution which reduce CI
effectiveness. Intracochlear fibrosis is also implicated in the loss of acoustic hearing that can occur months to
years after implantation. Thus, developing materials that mitigate insertion trauma and the inflammatory,
fibrous response to CI materials could significantly improve device function and safety. Ultra-low fouling
zwitterionic polymers are a new class of materials that show significant promise to eliminate fibrosis. However
as bulk materials they lack mechanical properties and long term durability suitable for use in CIs. To leverage
the ultra-low fouling surface properties of zwitterionic polymers while maintaining the proven mechanical
properties of current CI materials, we recently established a novel, patented photochemical process for
simultaneous polymerization, grafting and cross-linking of zwitterionic thin films on relevant CI materials. We
now leverage the mechanical advantages of recently developed dual network polymer technology to enhance
the strength of the thin films. We also use the thin films as novel drug delivery platforms with controlled and
sustained kinetics. We hypothesize that robust dual network, zwitterionic thin film coatings will maintain long-
term anti-fouling properties; reduce friction, insertion trauma, and intracochlear fibrosis; and provide controlled
sustained release of glucocorticoids. Accordingly, in Aim 1 we engineer robust, dual network zwitterionic thin
films for ultra-low fouling CI biomaterial coatings. Aim 2 investigates the effect of dual network, zwitterionic thin
film hydrogel CI coatings on tissue friction, insertion forces, cochlear trauma, and fibrosis using human cadaver
and sheep models. Finally, Aim 3 develops zwitterionic thin film hydrogel coatings with controllable, sustained
glucocorticoid delivery systems to reduce intracochlear inflammation and fibrosis in reporter mouse CI models.
Development of robust zwitterionic thin film coatings on implanted biomaterials that are lubricious, ultra-low
fouling, and capable of controlled and sustained drug delivery represents a transformative advance to prevent
trauma, reduce fibrosis, and improve the functional outcomes associated with placement of medical devices,
such as CIs, in the body."

that will quantify bone marrow-derived cell migration to normal and injured VF mucosa (Aim 1), identify the
functional contribution of monocyte-lineage cells to inflammatory signaling and fibrosis outcome following VF
mucosal injury (Aim 2), and determine phonatory outcomes following monocyte-lineage cell neutralization in a
humanized rat model of VF mucosal injury (Aim 3). The proposed research will define the relationship between
monocyte-lineage cell availability and VF wound healing outcome and, further, provide a foundation for future
work in the area of VF scar prophylaxis."
10831543,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Over 80% of children diagnosed with cancer become long-term survivors; however, 70% develop chronic or
life-threatening late effects from treatment, and these often emerge during young adulthood. Guidelines
recommend annual long-term follow-up care (LTFU) to manage and monitor for late effects, recurrence, or new
cancer(s). Yet, as risk for late effects increases in young adulthood and survivors transition into adult-focused
care, engagement in care plummets. Disengagement from LTFU leaves adolescent and young adult survivors
(AYA) vulnerable to delayed or poorly managed diagnoses, and relates to lower knowledge and self-
management abilities. Thus, interventions targeting re-engagement of AYA are critical for this vulnerable
population. In order to address this critical intervention need, we propose REACH (Re-Engaging AYA survivors
in Cancer-related Healthcare)—an innovative sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) with a
two-stage design. We will leverage our research on transition to adult care, survivorship care plans, and digital
health interventions. Stage 1 tests a low touch intervention (LTI), consisting of reminder “nudge” text messages
and informational resources for up to 4 weeks compared to an enhanced usual care group that will receive
written information (WI) only. Next, in Stage 2, AYA will be re-randomized based on responsiveness to Stage 1
(i.e., whether or not they made an appointment) into 16 weeks of intervention. Responders will either be re-
randomized to receive a continued intervention (maintenance) or a stepped-up condition, while non-responders
will only receive a stepped-up condition. Step-up may include expanded LTI (more text messages) or a high
touch intervention (HTI). The HTI includes text messages and digital resources, including a personalized
survivorship care plan (SCP), on a mobile-friendly platform with information tailored to variables such as
barriers to care, treatment history and recommendations, and a personal health goal. Additionally, social
worker and/or nurse support will be available to help overcome barriers (e.g., access care). The intervention
options in Stage 2 are intended to enhance self-management beyond simply attending LTFU in order to
sustain long-term engagement. Outcomes are measured after Stage 1 (T2), Stage 2 (T3) and at 9 months
(T4). We expect those who start with LTI versus WI will be more likely to attend a LTFU appointment by T4.
For Stage 2, those who receive the stepped-up condition compared to those with maintenance, and those who
received HTI compared to LTI, will be more likely to attend an appointment by T4. Attending an appointment by
T3 and indices of self-management are secondary outcomes. We will also assess moderators of intervention
outcomes, intervention engagement, acceptability, feasibility, and cost. Qualitative interviews will assess
multilevel barriers and facilitators of future implementation with stakeholders (AYA, parents/supports,
providers, administrators). This trial responds to NOT-CA-22-029 and PAR-21-035 to promote optimal
engagement in LTFU and self-management for AYA survivors, improving outcomes and reducing disparities."
11055674,"Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is a therapy with curative intent for a variety of malignant
and non-malignant diseases. One of the major complications after allo-HCT is graft-versus-host disease (GVHD),
especially of the gastrointestinal tract. Our group was one of the first to explore the role of the intestinal
microbiome in allo-HCT in patients and preclinical models by combining next-generation sequencing with
immunological, microbial and metabolomic approaches. We found relationships between the intestinal
microbiome and GVHD, relapse, infections, engraftment, and immune reconstitution. The clinical and preclinical
studies we performed in the previous funding period resulted in 19 manuscripts (including NEJM, Nature,
Science, and Nature Med). We observed in large multi-center studies that higher diversity of intestinal microbiota
was associated with better overall survival, reconstitution of CD4, mucosal-associated invariant and V2 T cells.
Expansion of particular Enterococci was not only associated with GVHD in patients but exacerbated disease in
mice. We showed that loss of Clostridia was associated with the onset of acute GVHD, whereas lower serum
levels of butyrate were associated with an increased risk for chronic GVHD.
In addition to their role in digestive physiology, bile acids (BAs) exert wide-ranging biological effects, including
antimicrobial activity, intestinal epithelial homeostasis, and modulation of immunity. Primary BAs (PBA) are
synthesized in the liver and transformed by the intestinal microbiota into a diverse pool of secondary bile acids
(SBAs) with unique biochemical properties. BAs can bind to Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor
that is a critical regulator of BA homeostasis, inflammation, and GI barrier function. Our preliminary preclinical
studies demonstrate that allo-HCT recipients with GVHD have: a) a decrease in unconjugated BAs and SBAs
in cecal contents and plasma, b) a reduced abundance of bile salt hydrolase genes (critical for SBA
transformation) in the intestinal microbiome, and c) decreased BA synthesis in the liver. In addition, we found
that a) most BAs can counteract FXR activation by the PBA chenodeoxycholic acid and b) donor T cells
deficient of FXR induce less GVHD. Our preliminary clinical studies corroborate the experimental results in that
fecal α-diversity is associated with increased abundance of SBAs, which are in turn correlated to less acute
GVHD and better overall survival. Based on studies demonstrating that BAs can inhibit Th17 polarization and
enhance Treg generation and our preliminary data in mouse models and allo-HCT patients, we hypothesize
that BA metabolism is an important modulator of alloreactive donor T cells and GVHD in allo-HCT recipients.
All our research is performed through perpetual dialogue between investigation in mice and humans.
Therefore, we propose to study the role of bile acids in GVHD after allo-HCT in preclinical models (Aim 1) and
allo-HCT patients (Aim 2) and to develop strategies to improve GVHD by targeting BA metabolism (Aim 3). Our
major goal is to ameliorate outcomes after allo-HCT by developing BA-based therapies."
10778626,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The commensal microbiome of the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract plays a critical role in host metabolism,
immunity, and homeostasis. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome is often associated with a loss in species diversity,
which can lead to increased susceptibility to metabolic dysregulation and higher chances for pathogens to
proliferate unhindered. For instance, Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI) is an archetypical bacterial infection
of the GI tract and a leading cause of hospital-acquired infections with severe negative outcomes including death.
Current treatment of CDI includes the use of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), which aims to restore the
disrupted gut milieu with a health microbiome. Unfortunately, the mechanism of such therapies is not well
understood as the rules governing microbial colonization of the GI tract have not been determined. We have
been developing spatial metagenomics as a unique and versatile approach to delineate the micron-scale spatial
organization of microbes in the gut that we hypothesize to play a major role in gut microbiome ecology. Here in
this renewal application, we propose 3 specific aims to 1) expand current techniques for spatial metagenomics
by adopting new approaches in single-cell genomics to increase throughput and enable new capabilities for
whole-genome analysis of the gut microbiome, 2) apply spatial metagenomics to human and mouse fecal
samples to delineate the process of microbiome recovery after fecal microbiome transplantation, and 3) leverage
our unique robotic culturomics system to isolate undiscovered strains in the gut and identify interspecies
interactions that drive community assemblage. These proposed studies constitute an exciting and concerted
push toward spatial profiling of the human gut microbiome in healthy and diseased states. Through a combination
of innovative conceptual and technical advances enabled by our approach, this effort will create new avenues to
mechanistically explore the role of the gut microbiome in health and disease."

10884259,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Strategies to enhance antigenicity, antibody affinity maturation, and memory induction in response to subunit
vaccines are of broad relevance for the design of effective vaccines against infectious diseases, and may be
especially important for difficult-to-neutralize pathogens such as HIV. One approach to enhance the efficacy of
subunit vaccines is to formulate antigens in a multivalent, nanoparticulate form, which promotes several aspects
of humoral immunity, and most notably enhances crosslinking of B cell receptors (BCRs). This approach has
been exploited both in licensed vaccines (e.g., the HPV and HBV vaccines), and in a great variety of vaccines
in preclinical and clinical development. However, to date it remains unclear what are the ideal characteristics of
nanoparticle antigen display. In this project, we use the unique technology of scaffolded DNA origami to engineer
nanoparticles on the 10–100 nanometer scale that offer the ability to investigate the impact of scaffold size,
antigen copy number up to more than 100, antigen-BCR affinity, as well as the nanoscale spatial organization
and dimensionality of antigen presentation on BCR activation. Specifically, we test the relative importance of
these parameters on B-cell activation, which are of central importance to the development of a successful subunit
vaccines, using the germline targeting engineered outer domain of HIV-1 gp120, termed eOD-GT8, and its
variants with different affinities, as a testbed. In vitro evaluation of early B-cell signaling and pathway activation
will be characterized, and contrasted with the benchmark strongly activating 60-mer control organized on a
protein scaffold. Single-cell fluorescence imaging is used to investigate the detailed mechanism of BCR-binding
and B-cell activation based on the optimal immunogen presentation found. These constructs are then used to
test the impact of these optimal HIV DNA-NP constructs on T-cell and B-cell response in vivo using mouse
models. Taken together, our results will offer the elucidation of the optimal immunogen presentation parameters
for effective immune cell response in the development of more effective subunit vaccines, with major translational
potential for HIV and other infectious diseases."

Directed evolution, which adopts principles of natural evolution to the laboratory, is singular in its impact on
molecular engineering. As one example, it is responsible for the generation of the majority of approved
therapeutic antibodies and those still in clinical development. Despite its progress, a valuable therapeutic niche
remains outside its scope: the mammalian cell. While in vitro systems, phage, bacteria, and yeast have lent
themselves to laboratory manipulation, mammalian cells have proven less tractable. Consequently, the power
of evolution remains inaccessible to drug development pipelines that seek to modulate mammalian cell
signaling. Further, many directed evolution campaigns result in biomolecules that fail in critical ways when
transplanted to human cells. To address these limitations and advance methods in drug discovery, I will
explore and mine viral diversity to create a novel system for molecular evolution in mammalian cells. Next,
focusing on the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor, I will create extracellular nanobodies to template a drug discovery
campaign via structural determination and in silico docking. The insights gained by these studies will be
applied toward the directed evolution of state-specific nanobodies against dark GPCRs. This work will result in
a general method for directed evolution in mammalian cells, chemical matter against HTR2A, and new paths
forward for the deorphanization of GPCRs."
10837717,"The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin and rapamycin analogs (rapalogs) extend healthspan and lifespan in
multiple model systems. However, the unknown potential for adverse events and dose limiting toxicities in non-
patient populations have precluded the long-term prophylactic use of rapalogs as a strategy to extend healthy
aging. NIA issued RFA-AG-23-008 to evaluate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of multiple
mTOR inhibitors in older adults at risk for numerous geriatric conditions. RFA-AG-23-008 specified the need
to 1) define safe and effective dose(s) in older men and women and 2) develop new methods to assess mTOR
activity and PD measures for application in clinical studies.
 Our team has demonstrated that inhibition of mTOR complex I (mTORC1) is beneficial and extends
healthy aging in mice, while many of the negative side effects of rapamycin may result from “off-target”
inhibition of a second mTOR complex (mTORC2). Intermittent dosing schedules (5 mg/week) with the rapalog
everolimus enable more selective mTORC1 inhibition and increased influenza vaccine efficacy in healthy older
humans. However, the highest dosing scheme (20 mg/week) did not improve vaccine efficacy and doubled the
number of adverse events compared to low dose and placebo. Therefore, a critical gap in knowledge is the
lack of PK/PD data for mTOR inhibitors in older adults to identify a safe dosage that could maximize
healthspan extension and minimize adverse effects by selectively targeting mTORC1.
 The first objective of this project is to establish new methods beyond immunoblotting a limited number
of mTOR substrates or immunoprecipitation from tissues to assay complex integrity, which can be readily
utilized in humans where only blood and select tissues can usually be obtained. The second objective of this
project is to use this novel methodology to identify a safe and effective dosing regimen for mTOR inhibitors
that can modify the biology of aging in humans. Here, in Aim 1 we will develop a molecular signature integrating
transcriptomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics in mouse blood and muscle that will allow us to discriminate
dosing regimens that selectively target mTORC1 or which inhibit both mTORC1 and mTORC2. We will then
use our molecular signature to test whether rapalogs are effectively inhibiting mTORC1 or mTORC2 in muscle
and/or blood collected from our ongoing 1) observational study of people taking rapalogs off-label under the
supervision of their physician and 2) a randomized, placebo control trial of low daily or weekly intermittent
everolimus treatment. In Aim 2, we will identify a recommended phase 2 trial dose for rapamycin and a novel
mTORC1-specific inhibitor in older men and women by performing a dose escalation study that evaluates
PK/PD, safety and tolerability, and mTORC1/2 inhibition using conventional as well as novel approaches.
Overall, we will pair comprehensive molecular and pharmacologic approaches to evaluate PK/PD in humans
and identify dosing regimens that safely inhibit mTORC1 to allow us to intervene in the biology of aging."
10873934,"ABSTRACT
X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a devastating neurological disorder caused by mutations in the
ABCD1 gene. The estimated incidence of disease is 1/17,000, however the recent institution of newborn
screening has revealed significantly higher rates. The majority of patients will develop cerebral ALD (CALD),
with the highest incidence occurring in childhood. Most patients undergo inflammatory demyelination followed
by neurodegeneration and death in 2 to 3 years. Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) is most effective
when initiated in the narrow window prior to the onset of neurological symptoms. There is an explicitly stated
need for more sensitive measures to detect lesion onset and progression. Early diagnosis of CALD will widen
the treatment window, provide lead-time for possible preventative strategies, and thereby help maximize
neurological outcomes. Decreased overall lipid content, increase in myelin very long chain fatty acid lipid
fractions, and decrease in myelin water content are the earliest pathological changes in CALD, prior to
demyelination. Diffusion Tensor (DTI) and Myelin Water Fraction (MWF) Imaging are advanced, in vivo
modalities specific to local fiber architecture and myelin water content. Dr. Mallack hypothesizes that
abnormal microstructural changes in early CALD during myelin development can be detected by DTI
and MWF prior to the onset and/or progression of demyelination. Dr. Mallack will test this hypothesis by
investigating individual white matter tract development (Aim 1), and lesion onset and progression (Aim 2), in
pediatric patients who developed CALD, asymptomatic hemizygotes, and controls. If his hypotheses are
validated by this study, the approach will (1) confirm normal myelin development in patients with CALD, (2)
reframe early CALD as a regional, tract-specific, divergence from the expected white matter tract maturational
curve, (3) provide a sensitive modality for early disease monitoring, and (4) aid in prediction of patients
appropriate for therapy.
By achieving these aims, Dr. Mallack will undergo rich inter-institutional mentorship by Dr. Florian Eichler, a
world expert in the leukodystrophies, at Massachusetts General Hospital and Dr. Sumit Niogi, a leader in
advanced neuroimaging, at Weill Cornell Medical College. Additionally, Dr. Mallack will be guided by a team
with complementary expertise in neurogenetic disorders, advanced imaging biomarker development and
investigation, and biostatistics. In addition to his career development activities, Dr. Mallack's committee of
mentors, collaborators, and advisors will promote his development and transition to an independent
investigator. This will address his goals of (1) using advanced imaging techniques to probe the underlying
biology of genetic white matter disease, and (2) translate cutting-edge image analyses into clinical applications,
thereby advancing the care of patients affected by these devastating disorders."
10832076,"Project Summary
 Our laboratory seeks to understand—and exploit—the biophysical relationships and logic structures that
allow biocatalytic networks to control complex cellular behaviors. We are broadly interested in (i) the kinetic
and structural features of enzymes that allow them to work together to coordinate nonlinear processes (e.g.,
metabolism, signal processing, and biological display), (ii) the role of natural constraints on biomolecular
diversity (e.g., a limited number of protein folds) in restricting the structures of biocatalytic networks and the
evolutionary trajectories of metabolites, and (iii) the logic structures that allow multi-enzyme systems to control
non-Boolean operations. These interests underlie a programmatic focus on the biosynthesis of targeted,
biologically active molecules. Natural products are a longstanding source of pharmaceuticals and medicinal
preparations. These molecules—perhaps, as a result of their biological origin—tend to exhibit favorable
pharmacological properties (e.g., bioavailability and “metabolite-likeness”) and can exert a striking variety of
therapeutic effects (e.g., analgesic, antiviral, antineoplastic, anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic, immunosuppressive,
and immunostimulatory). Recent advances in synthetic biology have supplied new approaches for the efficient
biosynthesis and functionalization of known, pharmaceutically relevant natural products; complementary
methods for the discovery and optimization new products with specific therapeutically relevant activities,
however, remain poorly developed. This program develops an experimental framework for using a therapeutic
objective (e.g., the inhibition of a human drug target) as a genetically encoded constraint to guide molecular
biosynthesis in microbial hosts. It departs from contemporary efforts to use microorganisms for the synthesis of
known, pharmaceutically relevant natural products by using them, instead, to build new biologically active
molecules. In an abstract sense, it describes a kind of biological computation (i.e., the microbial assembly of
molecular solutions to genetically encoded design challenges). Over the next five years, we will develop
selective inhibitors and activators of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). These enzymes contribute to an
enormous number of disease (e.g., diabetes, obesity, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, autoimmunity, and heart
disease) but lack targeted therapeutics of any kind. The resulting molecules will supply an important source of
both (i) chemical probes for studying PTP-mediated signaling events and (ii) starting points for the
development of PTP-targeted therapeutics. This work builds toward our long-term goal of using engineered
microorganisms to guide the discovery, biosynthesis, and evolution of new small-molecule pharmaceuticals."

Endocytosis plays a crucial role in supporting the health of the human brain. Functionally, synaptic vesicle
endocytosis allows neurons to sustain synaptic transmission without exhausting the supply of synaptic
vesicles. Structurally, endocytosis supports the maintenance of synapses and neural circuits. As a result,
defective synaptic vesicle endocytosis creates deficits in neurotransmission that underlie a wide spectrum of
neurological diseases and psychiatric disorders. The long-term goal of this study is to determine how endocytic
proteins act in concert to support diverse routes of endocytosis at synapses. Work from several laboratories
including my own has found that the curvature-sensing protein endophilin plays a critical role in synaptic
vesicle endocytosis. In this proposal, we will examine the hypothesis that curvature-sensing mechanisms guide
endocytic proteins to perform their function in various routes of endocytosis. We propose three Specific Aims.
1) We will determine the role of curvature-sensing motifs in vivo. We focus on the curvature-sensing
amphipathic helix of endophilin as it is essential for synaptic vesicle endocytosis. 2) We will study how
curvature signals are received by the downstream protein synaptojanin to support synaptic vesicle
endocytosis, and to prevent age-dependent decay of synaptic transmission. 3) We will determine the
mechanism of endophilin-independent endocytosis, an area that lacks molecular information. Through an
unbiased genetic screen, we have identified another curvature-sensing protein that acts in a parallel pathway
with endophilin. Results from these studies are expected to to push boundaries of current knowledge of
synaptic biology and to lead toward solutions for neurological disorders."
10847483,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Our research group studies human NAFLD using patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for in
vitro disease modeling. We recently showed that iPSCs from a cohort of NAFLD patients, when differentiated
to hepatocytes (iPSC-Heps), display a spontaneous disease signature in cell culture. This underscores the
importance of genetic background to NAFLD disease modeling and offers a unique opportunity to study the
impact of NAFLD risk genes on disease phenotype. We theorize that the disease phenotype in NAFLD iPSC-
Heps is due in part to established genetic risk factors identified through GWAS and in part to others that are
either poorly characterized or unknown. To address the impact of established and emerging genetic risk
factors on the NAFLD phenotype in iPSC-derived liver cells, we will leverage our unparalleled collection of 61
disease-specific iPSC lines (41 NAFLD, 19 control) and our ability to differentiate iPSCs along multiple liver cell
lineages to create mono- and co-cultures. In the course of three aims we will systematically study these cells
and catalogue the resulting resources and information for dissemination to the hepatology community. In Aim 1
we will develop a scorecard comprising the results of 15 transcriptomic, proteomic and functional assays for all
61 iPSC lines. The data will be used to develop individual and aggregate measures distinguishing normal from
diseased cellular phenotypes and correlate phenotypic profiles with individual and polygenic risk factors. This
aim will generate a large body of multi-omic data in the NAFLD iPSC model system that will be used as the
foundation for subsequent gene editing. Aim 2 will constitute a systematic effort to correct 113 variant genes in
33 NAFLD iPSC lines and repeat the full scorecard analysis after each edit. Comparisons will be made
between scorecards from individual gene-edited vs. parent lines, as well as in groups of iPSCs with similar
edits. Many iPSC lines will be subjected to sequential gene corrections and may revert to normal; iPSC lines
whose scorecard does not normalize will be scrutinized for the presence of novel variants with a plausible
disease association, followed by direct testing with further gene correction. Aim 3 will employ a complementary
but independent strategy involving whole-genome CRISPR screening in a NAFLD iPSC line to identify genes
whose inhibition suppresses a NAFLD signature. This aim will make use of fluorescent reporter iPSC lines and
high-content imaging to assess NAFLD-related outcomes. The CRISPR screen will enable us to discover novel
genes that have a direct impact on cellular phenotype and may be suitable for translation to the clinic. This
RC2 project will yield several deliverables: (a) rich, multi-omic datasets from a large cohort of parent iPSC lines
and isogenic gene-edited derivatives following multicellular differentiation and NAFLD modeling; (b) > 100
iPSC lines from which the data were generated; and (c) an iPSC line from a NAFLD subject transduced with an
arrayed whole-genome CRISPRi library suitable for future screening studies. Each of these resources will be
made freely available on open web-based platforms or biorepositories."
10862844,"Motivated by the bleak situation of oral cancer in India and encouraged by our successes in the UH2/UH3
mechanism for diagnosing and treating pre- and early cancers, a new integrated “Screen, Image and Treat
Optical System” (SITOS) is proposed in the current application which combines the expertise of 3 US sites in
collaboration with 2 clinical Indian teams. All sites were participants in the previous NCI awards as 2 individual
UH2/UH3 projects focused on either detection or therapy. The treatment continues to be photodynamic therapy
(PDT), a photochemistry-based, FDA approved modality while the detection is based on fluorescence and white
light imaging combined with a cloud-based deep-learning AI approach for image classification. The SITOS
enables image guided PDT, while a topical application of the dual property flourophore/photosensitizer precursor
to the oral cavity, more suitable for LMICs and designed to achieve better tumor penetration than previous topical
deliveries, is also developed. The goals will be accomplished in 3 Specific Aims. Aim 1 builds on previous
successful development and clinical validation of separate low-cost devices for intraoral imaging, and intraoral
PDT to produce a new, handheld, low-cost, easy-to-use, SITOS. The integrated platform enables the use of the
same hardware for initial imaging, and a single thernostic molecule for image-guided PDT and online monitoring
during therapy. Incorporated is an ergonomic intraoral light delivery for PDT and preliminarily validated in optical
phantoms and in vitro 3D tumor models. Aim 2A establishes conditions for topical photosensitization using an
adhesive ALA patch provided by Photonamic GmbH in ex vivo porcine mucosa model. Based on data from 2A,
Aim 2B establishes optimal PDT parameters in a murine xenograft model. Aim 2C validates the best of these
parameters in a carcinogen-induced hamster cheek pouch model which recapitulates transition from pre-
malignant to malignant lesions. Aim 3 applies SITOS to identify and treat high-risk oral potentially malignant
lesions (OPML), and early-stage oral cancer using broad guidance from the preclinical studies. Screening of
patients will take place at camps and remote villages led by the clinical teams in India as in the UH effort. Patients
with histologically confirmed HGD/OPML (and meeting other inclusion criteria) will be eligible. Patients will be
treated using the ALA topical patch, (after a small cohort establishes safety and optimal contact time, based on
Aim 2). Finally, PDT of high-risk OPML and early cancer in patients using light delivery and simultaneous image
guidance with the new intraoral probe will be performed.
Impact and relevance: The study provides, for the first time, a comprehensive low-cost approach that enables
not only detection of pre-malignant/malignant oral lesions, but also an effective, monitored therapy in LMIC
settings. The SITOS platform is mobile, handheld and appropriate for point of care applications. It brings together
collaborators (scientists, oral cancer surgeons, oncologists and industry) to help with FDA clearance of ALA
patch and SITOS. Capacity building: a new clinical modality and a platform for AI/engineering development."
10887556,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Perivascular spaces (PVS) are the area around arterioles, venules and capillaries which accommodate the
clearance of the metabolic waste via Aquaporin-4 channels expressed on astrocytic endfeet and are involved in
blood-brain barrier transport. PVS have come to prominence recently through potential roles in brain interstitial
fluid drainage and waste clearance, and in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other
neurodegenerative disorders. While animal studies have precisely clarified this mechanism, data from humans
are relatively crude and limited to visual counting of visible PVS on clinical magnetic resonance images, and this
limits our understands of the morphology, biophysical properties and distribution of the PVS in human aging and
AD. The long-term goal is to understand the role of PVS in brain health and the degree to which it alters in AD.
The objective of this project is to map morphologic and diffusion characteristics of the PVS fluid in
healthy aging, and how it is altered in the early stages of AD. The central hypothesis is that imaging-derived
PVS fluid characteristics, such as volume occupied and diffusion properties, are differentially and selectively
altered in cognitive decline and AD in comparison with normal aging. The rationale underlying this proposal is
that in vivo noninvasive mapping of the PVS provides mechanistic insight about AD pathophysiology. The
proposed work will also develop widely applicable open resources to map PVS morphologic and diffusion
properties that can be applied to a wide range of neurological disorders. The central hypothesis will be tested by
pursuing three specific aims: 1) Characterize changes in PVS fluid in normal aging individuals with no cognitive
decline nor evidence of AD pathology and evaluate the effect of image acquisition strategy on outcome
measures; 2) Identify PVS alteration in cognitive decline and in individuals with AD pathology; and 3) Determine
the extent to which PVS is associated with cardiovascular risk factors versus AD pathology. We will pursue these
aims by applying innovative MRI-based computational techniques on recently available data of normal aging and
patients with cognitive decline from multiple large NIH-funded studies. Computational techniques include both
recently developed neuroimaging techniques sensitized to the PVS and more established structural image
analysis techniques. The proposed research is significant, because it will aid in the understanding of AD
pathophysiological mechanisms and consequently assist in the early diagnosis and disease monitoring of AD. It
is also significant because it will make public resources available that can be used to study other neurological
disorders characterized by impaired PVS in the brain. The results will have an important positive impact
immediately because they will identify and map, for the first time, PVS alteration in human brain across aging,
cognitively impaired and AD individuals. Our shared PVS imaging tools can also be more broadly applied to a

Many diseases are complex, heterogeneous, conditions that affect multiple organs in the body and depend on the
interplay between several factors that include genetic, cellular, molecular, and environmental factors. It is therefore
not surprising that the pathogenesis of many complex diseases remain elusive, and therapeutic targets are lacking.
The traditional approach that focus on a small number of molecules (e.g., genes or metabolites) or a single type of
data (e.g., clinical or genetic) cannot address this complexity and heterogeneity. Integrative or systems biology
approaches and network analysis can be used to leverage the strengths of data from multiple sources (e.g.,
genomics, metabolomics, epidemiology, clinical data) to achieve new insights into the pathobiology of complex
diseases. Recent technological advances have enabled the production of vast amounts of diverse but related data
with rich information that offer remarkable opportunities to understand biological processes involved in complex
diseases and to transform medicine, yet at the same time present signiﬁcant analytical challenges including how
to effectively synthesize information from the tens of thousands of data points to identify important biomarkers
with potential to serve as therapeutic targets. To alleviate this, we will develop and apply a suite of novel, robust,
and powerful statistical and machine learning methods for the integration and interpretation of cross-sectional and
longitudinal data from multiple sources. These models will also be used to deﬁne subpopulations of patients who
have different prognoses or require different therapeutic approaches based on data from different sources. Further,
we will make use of recent advances in network theory to model the complex multilateral relationships in molecular
data from multiple sources. The proposed methods will be applied to several publicly available datasets and cohorts
to ensure that we can generalize our work to other datasets and cohorts and thus increase the long-term impact
of our research. The proposed research will also contribute valuable statistical and machine learning algorithms
that will be broadly applicable to data from multiple sources and multiple cohorts and will be made available to the
public free of charge."

 O-linked protein glycosylation orchestrates diverse signaling events in plant development in response to the
changing environment. We have discovered the first nucleocytoplasmic O-fucosyltransferase, SPINDLY (SPY)
in Arabidopsis, which together with its paralog SECRET AGENT (SEC), an O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), post-
translationally modify the conserved DELLA family of transcription regulators, such as RGA, to control their ability
to modulate multiple signaling pathways. SPY-catalyzed O-fucosylation of RGA enhances the RGA interaction
with key transcription factors to suppress plant growth, whereas SEC-mediated O-GlcNAcylation weakens RGA
activity and promotes plant development. Despite their functional significance, how these two homologous
glycosyltransferases, SPY and SEC, have evolved distinct substrate specificities and how these two types of
glycosylation, O-fucosylation by SPY and O-GlcNAcylation by SEC, regulate the RGA conformation to influence
plant development at the molecular level have remained unknown. We propose to elucidate the molecular details
of SPY, SEC, and their substrate and product complexes, as well as the distinct structural and functional
consequences of RGA O-fucosylation and O-GlcNAcylation. Recent proteomic analysis has unveiled hundreds
of SPY and SEC substrates beyond RGA, highlighting the broad implication of protein glycosylation in regulating
cellular functions. In order to overcome the potential pleotropic effects brought by spy and sec mutations in planta
and decipher the functional consequences of O-fucosylation and O-GlcNAcylation for specific target proteins,
we will develop nanobody-fused SPY and SEC variants for precise target modification. Collectively, our study
will fill the critical knowledge gap about the structural and functional consequences of protein glycosylation in
plants. As SPY-like genes are conserved in diverse organisms, including plants, bacteria, and parasitic protists,
and as SEC-like (OGT) genes are broadly distributed in plants and animals, a molecular understanding of these
enzymes and their distinct structural and functional consequences will have a profound impact in plant biology,
agriculture, and human health and diseases."

This project aims to discover novel pharmacological intervention for core symptoms of autism, including social
deficits and repetitive behaviors. One of the causal factors of autism is the loss of Shank3 gene, which
encodes a scaffolding protein at glutamatergic synapses. We will use Shank3-deficient mouse models and
human stem cell-derived neurons in this drug discovery endeavor. Genetics studies have found that many of
genes disrupted in autism are histone-modifying enzymes that mediate histone methylation/demethylation,
which play a key role in transcriptional regulation. Our preliminary studies have found that histone lysine 4
dimethylation (H3K4me2, linked to gene activation) is significantly decreased in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of
autistic humans and Shank3-deficient mice. H3K4me2 is demethylated by lysine-specific histone demethylase
1 (LSD1, KDM1A), which is found to be increased in PFC neurons of Shank3-deficient mice. We hypothesize
that inhibiting LSD1 to elevate H3K4me2 and restore gene expression may be able to ameliorate autism-like
phenotypes, therefore providing a novel therapeutic strategy for autism. Combined behavioral, biochemical,
electrophysiological, genomic and stem cell approaches will be used to test this hypothesis. Aim 1, we will
characterize epigenetic changes and therapeutic effects of epigenetic agents in mouse models of autism. The
alteration of histone methylation marks and histone demethylases will also be examined in PFC of Shank3-
deficient mice and autism human postmortem tissues. Aim 2, we will reveal the molecular mechanisms
underlying epigenetic treatment of autism models. Synaptic responses and neuronal excitability will be
recorded in Shank3-deficient mice treated with LSD1 inhibitors. Genome-wide alteration of gene expression
and histone methylation will be examined using RNAseq and ChIPseq. The causal role of identified key
molecules in the therapeutic effects of LSD1 inhibitors will also be determined. In Aim 3, we will examine the
molecular alteration and treatment strategy in human neurons from ASD patient with Shank3
haploinsufficiency. To find out whether the epigenetic treatment strategy found in Shank3 mouse models might
also work in autism patients, we will use the innovative stem-cell technology to examine the capability of LSD1
inhibitors to reverse synaptic deficits and molecular aberrations in ASD patient’s neurons derived from induced
pluripotent stem cells. Results from this study will not only reveal the mechanistic link among important autism
risk factors, but also uncover a mechanism-based treatment strategy for autism."

More than 345,000 patients are treated for a lower extremity injury (LEI) each year at trauma centers (TC) in
the United States. This represents a substantial societal burden both in the direct treatment costs and the
indirect costs due to lost work. These injuries are often painful, require considerable treatment interventions
and have the potential to cause long term disability. The most optimal place to treat LEI is at a TC due to the
required resources, staff expertise and coordination of care. However, TC capabilities vary based on certain
criteria, both structural (e.g. physical resources, provider skillsets) as well as process (e.g. intervention times).
This variation in capabilities is displayed by the TC level designation, from I (complete comprehensive care) to
III (assessment and stabilization), which often serves as a basic framework to guide triage and transfer
decisions for treatment. However, little research has been performed to date examining whether these
designations can or should be used for this purpose, since they are mostly based on “expert opinion” rather
than data. It is unknown if the criteria that are used for TC level designation are really appropriate to achieve
the best outcomes in patients with LEI. Capitalizing on the unique data infrastructure in the state of Michigan,
with rich trauma registry, cost and utilization data, this proposal will evaluate patients with LEI from the time of
their initial injury through their treatment course and will explore the factors important for delivering high value
care. The specific research aims are to evaluate: (1) short and long-term outcomes in patients with LEI across
TCs (2) the differences in overall episode spending and treatment efficiencies in patients with LEI at across
TCs (3) the characteristics of TCs that drive high quality efficient care of LEI patients. This will be the first
population-based evaluation of LEI that will follow patients throughout their continuum of care. This is possible
because of the innovative approach of linking datasets together to capture vital post-discharge information
which is essential for tracking orthopaedic outcomes (e.g. infection, malunion and nonunion) that occur in the
weeks and months after injury. Further, by examining the structures and processes at TCs, this study will have
the immediate impact of identifying the key characteristics that are important in driving optimal efficient care.
This research proposal, the highly experienced multidisciplinary mentorship team and the unparalleled
research environment will address the career goals and educational needs of the candidate, Bryant Oliphant,
MD, MBA, MSc. The proposal includes a detailed educational plan that will guide the successful completion of
this research and the development of Dr. Oliphant’s career as a health services researcher and leader in
trauma policy. The training includes graduate level courses in health care delivery systems, quantitative
methods as well as a hands-on approach to understanding the interplay of research with policy. This career
development award will lay the groundwork for Dr. Oliphant to become an independent clinician scientist who
performs innovative health services research and is a leader in improving trauma care in this country."
10817131,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Most small molecule drugs elicit their effects by modulating protein function, despite the
fact that only a small portion of the genome is translated (~1-2%). Further, only ~15% of the human proteome is
considered to be druggable, severely limiting therapeutic pipelines. The scientific challenge is to develop
generalizable methods to drug the other ~85% of coding genes. The purpose of this proposal is to advance a
radically new paradigm to expand the druggability of the (protein coding) genome by targeting disease-causing
genes at the level of their RNA. To do so, we will computationally and biochemically determine RNA secondary
structures in the transcriptome, with a focus on disease associated genes, to aid in the design of drug-like small
molecules to treat diseases at the RNA level. This innovative approach for targeting the transcriptome could
massively expand our ability to treat a wide array of diseases, spanning from genetic disorders to cancer and
pathogenic infections, and expanding the repertoire of drug action.
 The proposed studies synergize the expertise of two laboratories. Dr. Walter Moss’ Lab (sponsor) has
developed and implemented robust approaches to precisely define conserved and functional RNA structures
throughout the human genome. Dr. Matthew Disney’s lab (co-sponsor) has established a comprehensive
program for the design of small molecules that selectively target RNA and modulate disease biology, including
those that selectively recruit endogenous nucleases to a desired transcript. Collectively, our synergistic areas of
expertise will allow us to define the druggable human genome, drug undruggable protein targets at the level of
their mRNAs, and push forward a bench-to-bedside, precision medicine paradigm.
 In Aim 1, we will define conserved RNA structures throughout the genome, with a focus on validating and
targeting conserved structures in mRNAs that encode proteins that are considered undruggable. These studies
will define evolutionary conservation across vertebrate genomes to provide key insights into both biology and
druggability. We will evaluate and improve model structures using in cellulis RNA structure probing to test
predictions and, where needed, provide constraints that can be used to create experimentally informed revised
models. In Aim 2 we will generate a list of high value motifs with the highest probability of being druggable,
perform functional analyses to determine their effects on gene expression, and deduce interactions."

A small subset of pituitary adenomas demonstrates aggressive behavior as defined by rapid growth following
treatment, namely hormonal therapy, surgery, and radiation. Aggressive pituitary tumors are devastating, life-
limiting malignancies with two patterns of growth: (1) they can remain confined to the skull base and grow
relentlessly, resulting in progressive neurologic dysfunction or (2) they can metastasize. These tumors are
poorly studied and under-recognized in part because there are no validated biomarkers that predict future
aggressive behavior. We hypothesize that recurrent patterns of copy number variation, including a molecular
hypodiploidy phenotype, characterized by an early, clonal loss of one copy of chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10, 11,
13, 15, 17, 18, 21, and 22, predict future progression following treatment with radiotherapy. Additionally, we
hypothesize that aggressive pituitary adenomas and carcinomas harbor recurrent epigenetic and genetic
alterations at a gene and pathway level that define a more aggressive molecular subtype. This foundational
work is needed so that clinicians can prospectively identify tumors with a higher malignant potential. The
identification of a biomarker of aggressive disease is critical for improving patient outcomes by preventing both
over- and undertreatment, and for clinical trial development."

 The project is aimed at the development of a new highly sensitive multi-tumor type imaging procedure. The
imaging is based on a marker of the tumor blood vessels, the Follicle Stimulating Hormone Receptor (FSHR),
which was shown by us to be present in all major cancer types and at all stages, advanced and incipient. The
first Aim is to assemble the imaging agents and to test them in cell cultures. Anti-FSHR antibodies will be labeled
with imaging agents, tested for binding to cells in culture that produce FSHR and will be optimized by selecting
the best antibodies. The second Aim is to test the performance of the imaging agents in mice. The imaging
agents will be delivered by intravenous injection in mice that carry tumors formed by implanting human tumor
cells and the tumors will be imaged. A tumor cell line that generate metastatic lesions in mice will be used to
determine the smallest tumor size that can be detected. Tumors will be analyzed in parallel by
immunohistochemistry in tissue sections, in order to determine the yield and sensitivity of detection by imaging.
The procedure can contribute to a national priority in cancer research – to reduce substantially cancer mortality
by early detection of asymptomatic tumors. Early detection increases substantially the chance of successful
therapy, and significantly reduces the overall cost of cancer treatment. The method could be initially tested for
periodic screening of patients who are at high risk of developing cancer."
10877714,"PROJECT SUMMARY
No effective pharmacological or medical device interventions are available to treat heart failure with preserved
ejection fraction (HFpEF). We have pioneered the concept of cell therapy for HFpEF: Cardiosphere-derived cells
(CDCs) dramatically improve diastolic function and reduce arrhythmias, while attenuating fibrosis and
inflammation. Most, if not all, of these beneficial effects are mediated by exosomes secreted by CDCs (CDCEXO).
Here we seek to establish detailed molecular signatures of HFpEF; to use those molecular signatures as
roadmaps to identify key, potentially causal pathways by dissecting the responses to CDCEXO; and to discover
novel defined molecular entities, based on CDCEXO cargo, with disease-modifying bioactivity in HFpEF. Our
hypotheses, backed by strong preliminary data, are:
• Underlying HFpEF are bewilderingly extensive changes in myocardial transcriptomics and proteomics. Sorting
 causal from associative changes presents a major challenge, but it is doable.
• A subset of these HFpEF-related proteome changes are reversed by CDCs or CDCEXO and some correlated
 to the reversal of the key functional abnormalities of HFpEF. We posit that focusing on CDCEXO-responsive
 pathways will facilitate the search for causal abnormalities, enabling targeted hypothesis testing.
• By mining the RNA and protein contents of CDCEXO, we have the potential to pinpoint defined factors which
 have disease-modifying bioactivity in HFpEF. Such defined factors may themselves be viable therapeutic
 candidates, or can inspire the creation of new chemical entities as therapeutic candidates.
The overall goal of this proposal is to understand better the pathogenesis of HFpEF, and to develop novel cell-
free approaches to treat this disease. Three aims are proposed. In Aim 1 we will perform and analyze tissue and
single cell transcriptomics and proteomics (including numerous protein post-translational modifications) of
HFpEF, in three different models (pig, mouse and rat) that represent different comorbidities and compare their
disease signature to those in human HFpEF heart tissue. Commonalities in the OMICS responses among
species will help distinguish causal versus associative pathways in HFpEF pathogenesis. Aim 2 will analyze
molecular signatures of therapeutic efficacy by comparing transcriptomics and proteomics with and without
exposure to CDCEXO. Because CDCs and their exosomes strikingly reverse the HFpEF phenotype, identification
of CDCEXO-induced molecular changes will further refine pathway prioritization in terms of causal versus
associative. Here we will study ventricular tissue and single cells from rat, mouse and pig models of HFpEF (and
controls), with and without in vivo exposure to CDCEXO. In Aim 3 we will mine CDCEXO cargo to identify critical
factors underlying disease-modifying bioactivity in a rat model of HFpEF. This will allow us to define and/or create
specific molecular entities (either RNA species or proteins) that may be preferable to complex biologicals (cells,
exosomes) in terms of mechanistic discreteness, ease of manufacturing, and therapeutic consistency."

The Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics (DBEI), the Center for Clinical Epidemiology
and Biostatistics (CCEB) and the Center for Pharmacoepidemiology Research and Training (CPeRT) of the
University of Pennsylvania (Penn) Perelman School of Medicine submit this renewal application to continue
and improve our innovative and highly successful post-doctoral training program in clinical pharmaco-
epidemiology. Pharmacoepidemiology is the study of the use and effects of medications and other medical
products in populations. Our training program attracts highly qualified clinicians from across the nation.
 This two- to three-year intensive clinical research training program is designed to: 1) train clinicians to
be rigorous and independent investigators able to formulate research questions and use a wide range of
pharmacoepidemiologic approaches to answer those questions; 2) provide an understanding of the basic
principles of clinical pharmacology; 3) provide intensive, supervised research experience with mentors in
clinical pharmacoepidemiology and other content-area mentors; and 4) strengthen the links between clinical
epidemiology and clinical pharmacology. To learn the basic sciences of clinical research, fellows matriculate in
our highly-successful Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology (MSCE) or PhD in Epidemiology degree
programs and complete required courses in clinical epidemiology, pharmacoepidemiology, outcomes
measurement, biostatistics, and database management; elective courses in drug development, pharmacology
and other areas relevant to the fellows' interests and experience; independent readings; and participation in
research seminars and other activities within DBEI/CCEB and CPeRT. These skills are applied to the primary
focus of the training program, which is the design, implementation, analysis, and publication of mentored
independent research projects of the fellow's design that targets their independent research career goals.
 Strengths of the program include: 1) the large pool of highly qualified candidates with clinical training
seeking rigorous research training in pharmacoepidemiology; 2) the long history of successful research training
programs in the DBEI/CCEB, including in pharmacoepidemiology and comparative effectiveness
research/patient-centered outcomes research; 3) the comprehensive course offerings and research programs
available to fellows; and 4) the successful training record of the program director and other faculty. In addition,
the availability of the CPeRT and other CCEB faculty, who provide expertise in a wide range of methodologic
and clinical disciplines; numerous epidemiologic databases useful for research projects and training; a broad
array of specialized analytic capabilities available for clinical studies (e.g., clinical trials, case-control, cohort,
self-controlled designs); and the faculty members' commitment to collaborative research and training, combine
to provide an ideal environment for this program."

How do we decide whether to continue pursuing a goal or abandon the quest? Survival requires both the ability
to persist in behavior directed toward a goal and the ability to determine when it is time to stop, a finely-tuned
balance of perseverance and disengagement. The optimal balance between goal-directed and disengaged
behavior differs depending on internal state and the environment, and sensitive, context-appropriate regulation
of this balance is both essential and challenging. Excessive or insufficient goal-directed behavior is associated
with psychiatric dysfunction ranging from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder to obsessive compulsive
disorder to addiction. Disengagement from goal pursuit is an essential process, and it can be elicited by factors
with either negative or positive valence. For example, an animal might stop attempting to obtain water because
its actions to obtain water have failed, because it has already consumed enough water, or because it needs to
quickly respond to an imminent threat to survival. Are the circuits that suppress goal-directed behavior in
response to action failure the same as those that suppress goal-directed behavior after satisfying homeostatic
needs or in response to threats? The LHb is a major conduit of information from the forebrain to brainstem
neuromodulatory centers, and LHb neural activity suppresses midbrain dopamine neural activity via the
GABAergic rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg). LHb neurons fire when animals don’t receive expected
rewards and when they receive punishments, and stimulation of LHb neurons and glutamatergic inputs to the
LHb promotes behavioral avoidance. The objective of this study is to systematically probe the functional role of
lateral habenula (LHb) circuits in regulating disengagement from goals in response to action failure,
homeostatic resolution, and threat. We will use optical methods to monitor and control LHb neural circuits in
order to characterize the long-timescale dynamics and functional role of LHb neurons in regulating the balance
between goal-directed and disengaged behavioral states."

The overall goal of this project is to develop and test a detailed neural and computational account of the brain
mechanisms underlying speech motor sequence planning and motor program initiation and their breakdown in
stuttering. Persistent developmental stuttering affects more than three million people in the United States, and it
can have profound adverse effects on quality of life. Despite its prevalence and negative impact, stuttering has
resisted explanation and effective treatment, due in large part to a poor understanding of the neural processing
impairments underlying the disorder. This project aims to remove this critical barrier to progress through an
integrated combination of behavioral, neurostimulation, and neuroimaging experiments and associated
neurocomputational modeling. The studies in Aim 1 will characterize the neural mechanisms underlying sub-
syllabic sequencing in neurotypical individuals. In Study 1.1, we will use functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) to test the hypotheses that (1) phonological working memory in left posterior inferior frontal sulcus utilizes
an onset-nucleus-coda representation rather than representing an entire syllable as a single item, whereas (2)
ventral premotor cortex uses a syllable-based representation in which a fully learned syllable is represented by
a single motor program. Study 1.2 uses non-invasive neurostimulation to directly test hypotheses concerning the
neural substrates of improved performance accuracy (hypothesized to involve the cerebellum in concert with
motor cortical areas) versus speed (hypothesized to involve left posterior inferior frontal sulcus) when learning
novel syllables. In Aim 2 we investigate sequencing at the multi-syllabic level, including the effects of word
learning in adults with and without stuttering (Study 2.1) and children with and without stuttering (Study 2.2).
These studies will test the hypotheses that (i) novel nonword repetition performance is impaired in both children
and adults who stutter compared to neurotypical speakers, (ii) learning a multi-syllabic word reduces working
memory load compared to producing the same syllables prior to learning them as a word, and (iii) this reduced
working memory load will reduce error rate differences between individuals who do and do not stutter and will
increase fluency in those who stutter. In addition, Study 2.1 uses fMRI to probe the neural mechanisms involved
in word learning, thereby testing the model-based hypotheses that (i) anterior inferior frontal sulcus is the site of
a word buffer whose load is decreased by learning a multi-syllabic word compared to producing syllables in a
novel nonword combination, and (ii) impaired initiation of motor programs, rather than impaired working memory
per se, is the central contributor to stuttering.
Together these studies will result in an improved neurocomputational account of the brain mechanisms
underlying the sequencing and initiation of speech sounds in fluent speakers and individuals who stutter, thereby
paving the way for the development of new therapies and technologies for addressing this disorder."
10883592,"Stroke is recognized as a major cause of disability and death in elderly veterans. Stroke also
represents a critical, and potentially preventable, risk factor for cognitive decline mostly in the form of
vascular cognitive impairment in veterans. Silent brain infarctions (SBIs) are a manifestation of covert
cerebrovascular disease, without obvious clinical deficit but linked to a significant increase in risk for
subsequent stroke and cognitive decline. Identifying early markers of stroke risk in all veterans is
crucial for developing novel prevention and effective treatment strategies. While SBIs are strongly
linked to increased rates for both stroke and cognitive decline, no biomarker is currently available that
can predict the recurrence or location of these subclinical lesions. Lack of such knowledge limits our
ability to prevent ischemic strokes and vascular cognitive impairment in the aging veteran population.
 Coated-platelets, a subset of procoagulant platelets observed after co-activation with collagen
and thrombin, are significantly increased in patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack
(TIA) compared to unaffected controls. Higher coated-platelet levels, measured after the initial infarct
correlate with an increased risk for recurrent stroke and with lower cognitive performance post-stroke.
Among medications used to prevent stroke recurrence, we identified clopidogrel as a pharmacological
agent resulting in a sustained decrease in coated-platelet levels. In preliminary studies, we have
shown that higher coated-platelet levels in patients with stroke and TIA are strongly associated with
both the presence and number of SBIs. Additionally, we have found that differential expression of
platelet micro-RNA (miRNA) species may be linked to coated-platelet production, thereby providing
potential for deciphering mechanisms underlying differences in platelet reactivity through modulation
of gene expression. These novel findings raise the possibility that coated-platelets will serve as a risk
stratification tool for SBIs and are part of mechanisms involving platelet procoagulant potential and
platelet miRNA expression that explain the occurrence of SBIs. The research questions for the
current grant are: 1) Are coated-platelet levels markers for increased incidence of SBIs in patients
with stroke/TIA? and 2) Does clopidogrel treatment decrease the incidence of SBIs?
 The objective of the current application is to determine the role of coated-platelets as a marker
for SBIs and as a treatment target to decrease incident SBI. Three specific aims will test these
hypotheses: 1) Determine the relationship between coated-platelets levels and incident silent brain
infarction in veterans with stroke/TIA, and 2) Evaluate the efficacy of clopidogrel on the incidence of
silent brain infarction in veterans with stroke/TIA using a randomized, double-blind aspirin-controlled
clinical trial. We plan to test our hypotheses in a large group of patients with stroke/TIA.
 Successful completion of these aims will enhance our understanding of the relationship
between coated-platelets and silent brain infarcts. Such knowledge will improve health care delivery
for veterans through individualized risk assessment strategies. Our findings will also identify potential
targets for novel preventive pharmacological interventions that involve platelet reactivity in the
preclinical stage of stroke."

In the US, prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer death in men, with men of African
ancestry having the highest incidence and mortality rates. Indeed, men of African ancestry who develop PCa
have more aggressive and lethal prostate tumors on average, compared to their non-African ancestry
counterparts. While the reasons for this health disparity are unknown, evidence suggests that genetics is likely
a contributing factor. Indeed, large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of PCa have identified 300
genomic risk variants; however, the vast majority are in non-coding regions, which makes identifying the proximal
target gene challenging and hinders translational efforts. A large body of works have demonstrated that PCa risk
is highly enriched in functional regions of the genome, which indicates that risk is mediated through perturbed
regulatory action on relevant susceptibility genes. Multiple lines of evidence have shown that integrating omics
with large-scale genetic data increases statistical power to identify novel genomic risk regions and uncovers
target molecular mechanisms of risk. These analyses rely on first identifying associations between genetics and
various omics data (i.e., molecular quantitative trait loci, or molQTLs) and then using these associations to impute
or predict omics into large-scale PCa GWAS data. However, to date, analyses have been limited for three primary
reasons. First, previous integrative analyses with PCa risk relied on diverse omics data measured across tissues
other than prostate, where translation to prostate-specific results may be inaccurate. Previous omics datasets
measured in prostate together with genotype have been limited to small sample sizes, resulting in less accurate
prediction when compared with larger sample size datasets. Second, prior omics datasets have been measured
primarily in men of European ancestry. Multiple recent works find that genetic-based omics prediction translates
poorly across populations, which limits the utility of existing omics data to non-European men. Third, previous
studies have shown the importance of integrating omics data beyond gene expression with PCa risk, thus
demonstrating that multi-omics investigations facilitate a more unbiased approach to provide biological insights
into disease mechanisms. To date, the majority of imputation-based approaches have been applied to large-
scale GWAS, however recent works have made crucial discoveries in cancer biology by imputing cancer risk
from GWAS into molecular cohorts. Here, to understand the genetic regulatory mechanisms in prostate tissues
across the molecular cascade, we propose to assay methylation, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic
data in prostate tissue to perform large-scale molQTL mapping for African- and European-ancestry men. To
elucidate the underlying mechanisms responsible for PCa risk and identify novel genetic risk factors, we will
integrate identified molQTLs with the largest-available PCa GWAS. Overall, our proposal aims to characterize
the genetic regulatory landscape of prostate tissue, its effect on PCa risk, and health disparities of this disease."

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A diverse accumulation of infiltrating immune cells is a prominent feature of nearly all cancers1. By directing the
effector functions of cancer-killing T cells, the immune system has the ability to specifically target and mediate
clearance of large established tumors2–5. However, T cell effector function is typically constrained within
tumors, allowing disease progression. Recent insights into how tumors limit T cell function have translated into
new classes of cancer treatments such as immune checkpoint blockade (αCTLA-4 and PD-1) and the adoptive
transfer of large numbers of autologous tumor specific T cells6,7. While immune based therapies have
transformed the practice of oncology over a short period of time, such treatments only work in a small
percentage of patients, as cancers deploy multiple and non-redundant means to evade the immune system. As
our knowledge of the biologic drivers of tumor induced T cell dysfunction remains limited, the bounds of cancer
immunotherapy remain undefined.
A high abundance of cell death is found in many tumors and is associated with poor prognosis. Cell death
results in the release of intracellular potassium (K+), thereby increasing the extracellular potassium ([K+]e) the
tumor microenvironment. We first recognized that this that high [K+]e suppresses T cell antitumor function and
cytokine production, limiting antitumor immunity (Eil R et al, Nature 2016 & Science 2019). Mechanistically, K+
mediated suppression of T cell signaling required the phosphatase activity of PP2A. Genetically
reprogramming of T cell K+ transport translated into improved functionality in vitro and in vivo. While these
findings point to an unrecognized ionic checkpoint resulting from cancer cell death byproducts, others have
proposed cell death and tissue damage to increase immune activity due to the release of damage associated
molecular patterns (DAMPs) and inflammasome activation in myeloid cells. However, inflammasome signaling
is also suppressed by high [K+]e. Thus,our central hypothesis is thatintracellular K+ is a central regulator of
immunobiology that can be leveraged to augment T cell antitumor function.
Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is the second most common cause of primary liver cancer and is fatal
in nearly all cases unless surgically resected owing to resistance to cytotoxic and targeted therapies19,20. ICC is
characterized by a high degree of genomic intratumoral heterogeneity and necrosis as well as a recently
appreciated responsiveness to T cell-based immunotherapy, providing an ideal context in which to pursue the
research proposed herein. If successful, the research proposed in this submission will, 1) define the degree of
immune suppression enforced by cell death byproducts in the context of human intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma; 2) test novel cancer treatments based on augmenting T cell ion transport 3) clarify
previously unrecognized aspects of cellular biology controlled by intracellular K+ concentration."

The overarching theme of this project is to develop novel statistical approaches for designing and analyzing
biomarker discovery and validation studies. We consider here prospective studies in clinical settings where
risk markers are used for disease surveillance and prognosis. Motivated by our collaborative research in
the cancer biomarker ﬁeld, we plan to address several new challenges in prospective marker evaluation.
For many cancers, disease outcomes may be heterogeneous due to the multi-focal nature of the disease.
The speciﬁc prediction of the risk of developing aggressive cancer as opposed to indolent cancer is of
great clinical interest, yet it is analytically challenging. In Aim 1 we plan to develop statistical tools for risk
stratiﬁcation and individualized treatment rules in a population with a mixture of indolent and aggressive
cancers. Aim 2 will address complications in disease outcome ascertainment. Efﬁcient and unbiased
estimation procedures will be developed to quantify the prognostic and predictive accuracy of biomarkers.
These methods will be developed in the presence of interval censored data and surveillance-triggered
outcome ascertainment and imperfect or surrogate outcome measurements. Finally, we will derive novel
criteria for model selection with longitudinal data and develop novel approaches for deriving and validating
dynamic surveillance regimens for disease monitoring. The proposed methods will be tested in a wide
range of practice settings in cancer biomarker studies, including stratifying breast cancer survivors in risk
of second primary breast cancer; developing and evaluating optimal biopsy interval regimen in the active
surveillance of prostate cancer; accommodating surveillance-triggered outcome ascertainment schemes;
and making treatment decisions among patients who are at high risk for liver cancer, or colorectal cancer
recurrence."

pathogenesis of CKD in SCD is limited and therefore targeted therapies based on mechanistic models are
lacking. Progressive loss of renal function, represented by increased albuminuria and reduced glomerular
filtration rate (GFR), is associated with microvascular congestion in humans and mice with SCD. We postulated
that circulating cell-free heme, a product of hemolysis, may instigate persistent endothelial damage that ensues
CKD development. Endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) maintains endothelial barrier integrity. We discovered
an age-dependent as well as heme-induced loss of EPCR from renal microvascular endothelium in SCD (SS)
mice. Concomitantly, the cleaved soluble form of EPCR (sEPCR) was elevated in the plasma associated with
albuminuria. Using super-resolution ultrasound imaging, we found that younger SS mice challenged with the
repetitive infusion of minimal doses of heme and the older SS mice without heme challenge incur substantial
renal microvascular rarefaction. Heme induces endothelial P-selectin that promotes vascular congestion. Our
pilot data show that reduced EPCR expression is associated with increased P-selectin on renal microvascular
endothelium in the SS mice. Proteinase 3 (PR3), expressed on neutrophils, can degrade EPCR. In our repeated
heme-challenged younger SS mice compared to vehicle-injected mice, we noticed increased expression of PR3
in plasma as well as in accumulated neutrophils from the kidneys. Moreover, we found that heme induces
acetylation of histone 4 Lys 16 residues (H4K16ac) which are known to promote the biosynthesis of PR3. Based
on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that heme-induced P-selectin and PR3 concurrently result in the loss
of EPCR leading to endothelial disintegration, microvascular congestion, and CKD development in SCD. We will
test this hypothesis with three specific aims that integrate experiments with human renal endothelial cells and
neutrophils in vitro, murine models, and clinical samples from multiple cohorts of SCD patients.
Aim 1 will determine that repeated low-dose heme insults promote renal endothelial P-selectin that suppresses
EPCR leading to vascular damage and development of CKD in mice with SCD. Aim 2 will test whether heme-
activated PR3 facilitates EPCR cleavage and expedite CKD in SCD. Aim 3 will determine whether sEPCR and
specific genetic variants of EPCR can indicate the risk of CKD in SCD patients."

The recent NIDCR Oral Health in America report highlighted adolescence as a largely neglected life
stage in oral health research and practice, with persistent and largely unchanged high caries experience, and
called for strong actions to address this age cohort’s needs.1 Our team has been following a diverse cohort of
children from age 1-9.5 years, and proposes now to follow them into early adolescence, providing a unique
opportunity to assess U.S. children longitudinally culminating with much needed access and focus on
adolescence. Given the large persistent disparities in caries rates and inequities in access to care for
adolescents, targeted, risk-based healthcare delivery could be an important strategy to reduce disparities in
adolescent health, while containing costs. The problem is that there have been almost no U.S. studies
following the life-course progression of caries in children through adolescence to assess and predict caries
patterns and disease trajectories over time, and relationships between these and changing oral and systemic
health patterns in risk factors and behaviors. This is critical for targeting preventive, person-centered care in
interprofessional settings that can adapt to changes in the life-course. The aims of this innovative U.S. study
renewal are: 1) To define dental caries patterns (teeth and surfaces affected, e.g., pit-and-fissure vs. proximal,
anterior vs. posterior) in early adolescence, including the trajectories of changes in caries patterns and counts
(e.g., dmfs/DMFS) across the age-span (ages 1-15 years) (sub-aim 1a), in both primary and permanent teeth.
2) To identify patterns of caries risk factors and behaviors in the cohort when they were preschoolers (ages 1-
4), school-age (ages 6.5-9.5) and early adolescents (ages 12-15), and changes over time (sub-aim 2a). 3) To
characterize the interplay among longitudinal caries patterns and risk factor/behavior patterns that lead to
future caries development, we aim to develop risk screening tools to predict caries patterns, and predict caries
incidence (sub-aim 3a), in early adolescence. This will be accomplished by following a diverse cohort of 500
primary caregiver (PCG)-child pairs enrolled in our ongoing U01 study. The PCGs will provide medical history
and socio-demographic family information, while the adolescents will complete risk behavior questionnaires,
and will have caries examinations at 12, 13.5 and 15 years of age to determine caries incidence, patterns, and
trajectories. A great strength of this proposal is that it involves experienced medical/nursing and dental
research groups, who have successfully worked together for the past 11 years and can facilitate follow-up of
the cohort, while bringing new expertise in adolescent and behavioral health, and clinical decision-making. The
overall impact and significance of this interdisciplinary project is that accurate risk stratification can optimize
cost-effectiveness of personalized care, policy development, and public health planning. We will also be able to
identify targets for intervention, and relationships with systemic health risk factors and comorbidities that can
impact how we intervene to provide collaborative interprofessional care to improve adolescents' health."

Our long-term goal is to understand diaphragm contractility in health and disease, and the role of titin therein.
The diaphragm muscle drives respiration and is constantly subjected to mechanical loading. Changes in
mechanical loading rapidly affect diaphragm contractility, e.g., within hours of diaphragm unloading during
mechanical ventilation (MV) in ICU patients, severe diaphragm weakness ensues, contributing to difficult
ventilator weaning. The pathophysiology of diaphragm weakness is incompletely understood. In the proposal at
hand, we will study the role of depressed interactions between myosin and actin, the two key contractile proteins
in myofibers, and the role of titin in force depression. Our pilot data suggest that unloading of the diaphragm
causes the myosin motors to adopt the so-called ‘super-relaxed state’ (SRX). Once in the SRX state, less myosin
motors are available for binding to actin, and less force can be generated. We will also study the role of the giant
protein titin in releasing myosin from the SRX state and investigate whether during MV-induced unloading of the
diaphragm, this mechanism is perturbed.
Aim 1 will determine the SRX state of myosin in the diaphragm of ventilated ICU patients. We will use our
diaphragm biopsies of ICU patients to study the contractile force of diaphragm myofibers and determine the
number of myosin motors that attach to actin during activation. We will combine mechanics with X-ray diffraction
and biochemical assays to resolve with nanometer resolution the position of myosin motors relative to actin
during activation and the proportion of myosin in the SRX state. In Aim 2 we will determine the role of
posttranslational modifications in the SRX of myosin. Phosphorylation of regulatory light chains (RLC)
regulates the SRX state of myosin and we will apply mass-spectrometry on the diaphragm biopsies to determine
the phospho-proteome, and we will establish whether there is a cause-and-effect relation between RLC
phosphorylation and SRX by performing RLC exchange experiments into patients’ myofibers. To critically test
whether changes in RLC are caused by diaphragm inactivity, we will ventilated healthy rats, and study RLC
phosphorylation. Aim 3 will determine whether, in addition to RLC phosphorylation, direct mechanical
effects of titin on myosin induce SRX. Titin-based passive tension strains the myosin filament which regulates
the SRX state. We will study whether the reduction in titin-based passive tension, due to diaphragm unloading
during MV, reduces the strain in the myosin filament and increases SRX. We will use mouse models with
genetically engineered increased or decreased titin-based passive tension and study the effect of MV on the
SRX state of myosin.
The innovation of this proposal lies in the novel research foci and guiding hypotheses, unique diaphragm biopsies
from patients, and its novel tools and mouse models, The proposal’s integrative approach is expected to lead
to a major step forward in our understanding of diaphragm function and titin’s role therein."

One of the most frequently discussed challenges facing the auditory system is parsing the voice of a single
speaker in a noisy acoustic environments comprising multiple other speakers, commonly referred to as the
Cocktail Party Problem (CPP). Despite the significance of the CPP to illustrate the complex nuances of
audition that unfold in real-world situations, remarkably little remains known about the supporting neural
mechanisms at different levels of the auditory circuit. This gap in our knowledge has emerged, at least in part,
due to a lack of a behavioral paradigm in animal models that both recreated the natural complexities and
dynamics of natural cocktail parties, while at the same time affording experimental control to manipulate the
acoustic scene. Here we seek to bridge this gap by leveraging a novel, multi-speaker behavioral paradigm in a
series of complementary experiments to investigate the perceptual and neural mechanisms that are employed
in the primate brain to resolve the CPP for natural communication in freely-moving common marmosets.
 Aim 1 establishes an innovative behavioral paradigm that recreates the natural dynamics of real-world
cocktail parties by creating an acoustic scene comprising multiple computer-generated virtual monkeys (VM)
whose individual identity and spatial position can be independently and systematically manipulated. Each
marmoset placed in these cocktail parties naturally learn the identity of the interactive VM based on
idiosyncrasies of their voice and vocal behavior and selectively engage them in conversations, while ignoring
the distractor VMs engaged in conversations with each other.
 Experiments in Aim 2 involve performing simultaneous neurophysiological recordings of prefrontal
cortex and hippocampus in marmoset monkeys as they communicate in a cocktail party described in Aim 1.
Specifically, experiments are designed to test the respective and complementary roles of these neural
substrates in the auditory representing the identity and spatial position of individuals in the CPE. Because of
the respective role of prefrontal cortex in attention and hippocampus for allocentric representations of space,
these substrates are hypothesized to be critical to resolving the CPP in primates.
 Aim 3 aims to build on the complementary conceptual and experimental innovations to more directly
interrogate the perceptual and neural mechanisms that support communicating in a cocktail party. Specifically
we will a cutting-edge closed-loop feedback paradigm that uses machine learning algorithms to optimize the
conversational dynamics between the interactive VM and live marmoset in a multi-speaker cocktail party. This
model will selectively manipulate targeted features within the ongoing natural conversations to directly
interrogate the system and determine the functional role of behavioral parameters and related neural
processes."

Oligonucleotides face several biopharmaceutical difficulties, including stability and delivery issues as well
as non-hybridization activities such as coagulopathy and unwanted activation of the immune system. We
have developed a unique oligonucleotide delivery system, termed pacDNA, which uses a high-density
bottlebrush polymer to provide oligonucleotides with binding selectivity. The polymer amounts to an
entropic barrier, reducing access to the oligonucleotide by various proteins (and thus side effects) but still
allows for unhindered hybridization. This novel strategy not only improves nuclease stability, preserves
target-binding capability, and minimizes off-target side effects, but also massively enhances plasma
pharmacokinetics, tissue retention, and antisense potency in vivo. Our current studies also reveal that the
pacDNA’s pharmacological properties are intimately related to the bottlebrush backbone. In addition, the
pacDNA appears to be uniquely capable of evading anti-carrier adaptive immunity, which is useful for
therapies that requires long-term/frequent dosing. Finally, the pacDNA deposits into tissues and organs
that lack mature delivery technologies for, such as the skin, the skeletal muscle, and the heart. These
surprising and enabling discoveries will be the basis for investigations in the next funding period, in which
we will 1) explore the property space of the pacDNA structure using a combinatorial polymer library with
specific backbone compositions and monomer sequences; 2) probe in vivo properties of the pacDNA in
mouse and non-human primate models and how it is able to evade adaptive immunity; and 3) explore the
potential of pacDNA to create first/best-in-class therapies that take advantage of its unique strengths using
a relevant preclinical disease model (progeria). We anticipate that accomplishment of these objectives will
yield significant fundamental understanding of this class of materials and bring us much closer to clinical
evaluation of pacDNA."

Disruptions of the internal circadian clock system reduce reproductive success in both humans and animal
models. For example, shift workers have greater rates of menstrual cycle disruption and endometriosis,
reduced fertility, and have an increased risk for pre-term birth, low birth weight, and miscarriage. The
mechanisms that contribute to this public health problem are unknown. We have focused on changes in when
food is consumed, because circadian disruption often leads to abnormal food consumption during normal
fasting phases. In a preclinical model, we have found that mis-timed meals reduce fertility in mice via an
uncoupling of mating behavior and ovulation rhythms. In particular, in mice that eat during their rest phase, the
pre-ovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge that normally occurs at lights-off instead can occur at any time
throughout the day. It is desynchronized from both the light-dark cycle and the feeding cycle. The timing of the
LH surge is controlled proximately by a population of kisspeptin neurons that receive direct input from the
circadian clock and that are sensitive to estradiol and metabolic cues. Our goals in this application are to
identify specific mechanisms by which food-induced disruptions of central circadian clocks lead to impaired
reproductive success. This will be accomplished in three aims. First, the relative sensitivity of male and female
reproductive function to mis-timed food will be assessed. Second, we will determine how rhythmic light and
food cues are integrated by an important ovulatory control system—kisspeptin neurons in the anteroventral
periventricular nucleus. Finally, we will address the direct converse of our observation that a mismatch
between the light-dark cycle and the circadian clock impairs reproduction. Namely, can appropriate food timing
protect against circadian disruption and rescue reproductive competence? In addition, we will quantitatively
assess the role of circadian clocks in kisspeptin neuronal function. The results of these studies will show how
environmental cues and hypothalamic clocks interact in the control of fertility."

Chronic low back pain (cLBP) is the world's leading debilitating condition and the most common reason for
opioid prescription in the US. While axial cLBP is commonly considered non-specific and multifactorial, it is
often suspected a dysfunction of the spinal stabilization system that includes the intervertebral disc (IVD) and
adjacent paraspinal muscles (PSMs). Axial cLBP is notoriously challenging to treat because of uncertainty
about patient-specific causal mechanisms preventing effective matching to treatments. IVD degeneration is
easily appreciated with clinical imaging and often studied. Less is known about the role of PSM degeneration,
including atrophy and fat infiltration (FI), which are assumed to relate to cLBP, although existing evidence does
not provide a clear association. Given the availability of advanced MRI sequences that quantify FI, it is now
possible to investigate PSM FI patterns that will inform how it may relate to functional outcomes in cLBP
patients.
 The current working hypothesis is that degenerative IVD pathology promotes PSM FI as a result of a
compensatory biomechanical response of the muscle in an attempt to stabilize an affected spinal segment that
overtime leads to neuromuscular fatigue and/or from direct exposure to pro-inflammatory factors from IVD
damage. We hypothesize that PSM FI spatial distribution patterns (fat maps) have significant correlation with 1)
patient-specific kinematics and PSM activation patterns (i.e. motor control), and 2) bimolecular factors, derived
from patient PSM muscle biopsy. To test this hypothesis, we will quantify PSM FI, degenerative IVD pathology,
trunk and full-body kinematics, and paraspinal muscle activation in 40 axial cLBP subjects and 40 age-matched
controls. We will also collect a muscle tissue sample from the cLBP patients to uncover the biomolecular
mechanisms of PSM FI. In this study, we are proposing to 1) quantify spatial distribution of paraspinal muscle
fat infiltration and associate resulting fat maps with cLBP and degenerative IVD pathology, 2) quantify motor
control patterns from multi-domain muscle activation and kinematics data types and associate with cLBP
symptoms and PSM FI, and 3) uncover different potential biomolecular mechanisms underlying distinct PSM FI
and motor control patterns in cLBP patients. This study has been uniquely crafted to investigate different reasons
for how PSM might become infiltrated with fat in axial cLBP patients and, furthermore, the potentially disabling
functional outcomes associated with PSM FI in cLBP patients. This work will advance our understanding of the
clinical relevance and causal mechanisms of PSM FI in relation to cLBP and inform future efforts to use PSM
FI as an imaging biomarker to optimize patient-selection for specific muscle-targeting cLBP therapies to
improve outcomes."

Recent advances in human genetics have unequivocally demonstrated mutations in microglia-specific genes,
such as TREM2 R47H, to be some of the strongest risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD). These
breakthroughs point to microglia as a potential driver for AD pathology and thus a promising target for novel
therapeutics. Remarkably, single-cell RNA sequencing studies have also uncovered a unique microglial subset,
named disease-associated microglia (DAM), which are found to surround amyloid plaques in mouse models of
AD. Compared to homeostatic microglia, DAM upregulate a cohort of signature genes, including AD risk genes
TREM2 and APOE, which are also elevated in microglial subsets from human AD patients. Despite the apparent
significance of DAM in AD, critical knowledge gaps exist regarding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that
generate DAM as well as the functional contribution of DAM to different stages of AD pathology. The overall-
objectives of this proposal are to determine the cellular origin, transcriptional regulation and subset-specific func-
tion of DAM in AD. As microglial gene loci can be primed at the enhancers, microglial activation may lead to
depositions of certain long-lasting epigenetic marks, which facilitate more rapid changes of gene expression
upon a second hit later in life. Therefore, in theory, developmental activations, as we have observed for prolifer-
ative region-associated microglia (PAM) in the normal developing white matter, may confer naïve homeostatic
microglia such memory at the epigenetic level to allow their faster conversion to DAM in response to disease
signals. Consistently, PAM and DAM share the same transcriptomic signature, which is presumably in turn reg-
ulated by conserved transcription factors. In addition, analyses based on microglial depletion and global mutants
of Trem2 and Apoe (partially controlling the DAM phenotype) have provided important hints for a possible neu-
roprotective role of DAM by compacting amyloid plaques and limiting its spread. However, given the heteroge-
neity of microglia and technical limitations (e.g. DAM resistant to drug depletion), the function of DAM during AD
progression is still controversial. In this proposal, we will test the central hypothesis that conserved transcriptional
and epigenetic mechanisms regulate DAM, which are ontogenically related to PAM and serve as the major
neuroprotective microglial subset in AD amyloid pathology. Aim 1 will delineate the cellular origin of DAM in AD
through genetic fate mapping and epigenetic profiling. Aim 2 will determine the transcriptional regulation of DAM
in AD by transplantation of genetically modified primary microglial cells. Aim 3 will define the function of DAM in
AD via microglia subset-specific manipulations. Upon completion of the proposed research, we expect to have
elucidated the cellular origin, genetic and epigenetic mechanisms as well as in vivo function of the disease-
associated microglia subset in AD. These results will provide mechanistic insights into selective subpopulations
of microglia that may control AD progression, ultimately paving a new avenue for the development of precise
microglia-based interventions to treat AD."

Strategically positioned as the gatekeepers between the circulation and the immune system, splenic marginal
zone (MZ) B cells form a frontline of defense against blood-borne pathogens. They mediate early protective
responses against diverse T-dependent and T-independent antigens, by employing strategies that blur the
boundary between innate and adaptive immunity. In humans, MZ B cell deficiency is linked to reduced IgM
titers and heightened susceptibility to sepsis and mortality related to encapsulated bacterial infections. In
addition, impairment in their function and localization is associated with several autoimmune pathologies.
Despite their importance, many aspects of the ontogeny and homeostasis of MZ B cells remain obscure.
The establishment and maintenance of MZ B cells in their splenic niche are determined by a complex set of
rules that regulate cell division, the influx of new bone marrow (BM) derived cells, death, and onward
differentiation. We hypothesize that the rules governing MZ B cell dynamics evolve as we age, and are
modulated significantly during immunogenic encounters, resulting in a profound variation in their niche size
and clonal composition. Here, we propose a unique integrative approach that synthesizes mathematical and
experimental strategies to quantitatively map the developmental trajectories of MZ B cells and dissect the
mechanisms that maintain their numbers and clonal diversity, across the lifespan.
Specifically, we will develop mechanistic mathematical models to describe the data derived from a validated
experimental system in which one can track the constitutive replacement within the MZ B cell compartment,
over long timescales in healthy mice. This approach will allow us to measure turnover, reveal any
heterogeneity within the MZ B cell pool, and define their developmental trajectories. Further, we will adopt
and extend these deterministic models to identify the rules governing the establishment of MZ B cell niche in
early life and formulate them as PDE systems to quantify the dynamic transitions in cells’ ability to persist,
as a function of time since their compartmental entry. Next, we will develop a dynamical modeling strategy
to map B cell differentiation pathways during immune responses, using novel mouse strains expressing an
antigen-inducible reporter gene and B cell-specific mutations in Notch2. Lastly, we will employ a
computational pipeline to study the single-cell immune repertoire and transcriptomic profiles of activated B
cells and to generate phylogenetic trees of antigen-specific clones as they diversify during immune responses."

 Intellectual disability (ID) affects 1-3% of the world population. Six and a half million Americans have been
diagnosed with ID. Identification of genes and variants that cause ID in a variety of populations. i.e., African,
Asian, and European is highly beneficial for understanding brain mechanism and function, development of
treatment modalities, and diagnosis through genetic screening. Although >1000 genes have been identified
for ID, most genes remain to be uncovered.
 For this study we will ascertain 500 ID families from Finland, Hungary (Romani and Magyar), Mali, and
Pakistan. Families with ID due to a FMR1 repeat expansion (Fragile X syndrome) or environmental exposures
(trauma or infection) will be excluded. The studied will consist of trios (affected proband and parents), nuclear
and extended families including those with consanguinity. Next-generation sequencing will be performed on
DNA samples obtained from the proband and his/her parents for the trios and on average three affected
members for the nuclear/extended families. Analysis of the sequence data will be performed by implementing
tools developed in house that are incorporated in Jupyter Notebooks using information on variant frequency,
deleterious status, and conservation as well as database annotations on clinical etiology, animal models, and
brain expression. Candidate variants will be validated and for nuclear/extended families tested for segregation
with ID using DNA samples obtained from all available family members. Three-dimensional protein modeling
will be performed to investigate how identified variants affect protein function. Once a putatively causal ID
variant is identified, we will screen our collection of ID pedigrees and use GeneMatcher to find additional ID
families that segregate potentially pathogenic variants within the same gene. For newly identified ID genes,
spatiotemporal expression profiling will be performed in the developing and adult brain and nervous system
to provide additional evidence of the gene’s involvement in ID etiology and to better understand how disruption
of the gene can impact brain function.
 ID has been understudied in African populations. The study of West Africans (Mali) should bring about new
knowledge which can directly impact African Americans since their ancestors were brought to the Americas
from West Africa through the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Pakistani families due to their size and structure are
highly beneficial in identify ID genes. The Hungarian Romani and the Finnish both belong to founder
populations which can aid in variant identification. This unique resource of families from Africa, Asia, and
Europe will aid in better understanding of the genetic etiology of ID and the role genetic plays in brain function.
The new knowledge obtained from this study should be beneficial to the health of minority and non-minority
American populations."

 The recent increasing prevalence, severity, and healthcare burden of sinoatrial (SA) node dysfunction
emphasize the need for more detailed studies of SA node functions that allow for effective therapy to treat and
prevent SA node dysfunction. The major mechanisms of the dysfunction are the impaired ability of pacemaker
cells to induce spontaneous rhythm (automaticity) and adverse remodeling in their electric conduction to
surrounding atrial tissues (SA conduction). However, the current SA node or pacemaker models have been
limited to theoretical models and isolated single cell-type cells or cell clusters, leaving a gap to model the
autonomous cardiac contraction and heart rhythm and dysfunctions in automaticity and SA conduction. Moreover,
the current single cell-type pacemakers worsened heart rhythm stability during one-month in vivo integration,
which limits its application as a clinically viable biological pacemaker capable of generating robust pacemaking
and conduction.
 To address the current limitation of SA node models, this proposal aims to develop a three-dimensional
multicellular SA node organoid by reproducing human SA node’s multicellular tissue structure and fail-safe
mechanisms. In contrast to the single cell-type biological pacemakers, human SA node is a natural organoid with
elaborate insulated architecture and heterogeneous cellular composition. Moreover, the human SA node is
equipped with redundant pacemaker sites and conduction pathways to protect the rhythm against adverse
chronotropic stimulations. Thus, inspired by SA node’s structure and fail-safe mechanism, we aim at enhancing
robustness in both automaticity and SA conduction: First, we will focus on enhancing automaticity of SA
node organoids by identifying the expression of pacemaker membrane and calcium clock proteins, cell
composition, and shape (Aim 1). Second, we will concentrate on improving conduction of SA node organoids
by coordinating multiple pacemaker sites and conduction pathways (Aim 2). Last, we will evaluate the
robustness of the SA node organoids in in vitro setting and in vivo atrioventricular block rodent model (Aim 3).
 These studies will define if tissue-level architecture and multicellular compositions mediate SA node’s robust
pacemaking and conduction and may reveal a high-fidelity tissue-level biological pacemaker as a novel
therapeutic strategy for SA node dysfunctions. The proposed organoids will be suitable for human preclinical
testing assays to accelerate drug development, for dissecting patient-specific SA node disease pathophysiology,
and for the development of implantable biological pacemakers."

Obesity is a growing epidemic in the United States, leading to increases in cases of nonalcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD), cardiovascular disease, and type II diabetes. A common characteristic of these diseases is
aberrant lipid and glucose metabolism. This proposal centers on the nuclear hormone receptor, Liver Receptor
Homolog 1 (LRH-1), which acts as an important regulator of lipid metabolism, reverse cholesterol transport,
glucose sensing, and homeostasis. As such, LRH-1 represents a novel therapeutic target for metabolic
diseases. LRH-1 binds to phospholipids (PLs) and is activated by the unusual PL dilauroylphosphatidylcholine
(DLPC) which shows potent anti-diabetic effects. The discovery that LRH-1 is regulated by PL ligands reveals
an exciting potential to tune LRH-1 activity for the treatment of metabolic diseases. However, PLs are labile
and not suitable for clinical use, necessitating the development of small molecule agonists. This has proved
challenging thus far, since very few small molecules can displace endogenous lipids from the large, lipophilic
binding pocket. Recent studies in our lab have characterized a class of small molecules that are capable of this
feat. Using robust SAR and innovative chemistry, we have designed potent LRH-1 agonists that display
biological activity. We have modified our most potent and efficacious agonists to improve their biophysical
properties, making them suitable for in vivo studies. The advancement of LRH-1 agonists as therapeutics has
also been hindered by the lack of appropriate rodent models to screen potential candidates due to small
sequence differences in the binding pocket of rodent and human LRH-1. To overcome this barrier, we used a
CRISPR-Cas9 strategy to humanize the mouse LRH-1 ligand binding pocket. This permits activation by
synthetic agonists while minimizing changes to endogenous interaction surfaces. These leaps forward in lead
compound development and mouse model generation, in combination with our deep knowledge of LRH-1
structure and function, create an ideal platform to develop candidate preclinical LRH-1 modulators for
metabolic disease. Here, we have developed a strategy to define mechanisms of action, target engagement,
pharmacology, and disease efficacy of our lead compounds. In aim 1, we generate compounds with improved
biophysical properties that mimic PL-like activation. We will perform mechanistic characterization of these
compounds to explore how contacting the PL-binding site with different polar moieties improves LRH-1
activation. In aim 2, we will examine the behavior of our lead compounds from an ADME perspective. The
primary objective will be to establish tractability of the compounds using our humanized mice, so that
pharmacokinetic relationships can be established. In aim 3, we will use our humanized mice and a model of
diet-induced obesity to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of our lead LRH-1 compounds to improve glucose
tolerance and insulin resistance."

Chronic itch is a debilitating condition and represents a clinical challenge. Increase evidence has demonstrated
that neuronal and astrocytic signaling pathways in the spinal cord play a crucial role in chronic itch. Although
several molecules have been identified as key itch mediators/modulators, molecular mechanisms underlying
chronic itch remain incompletely understood. Our research has been focused on role of store-operated calcium
channels (SOCs) in pain and itch. We have shown that the primary SOC family members STIM1 and STIM2
(endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ sensors) are expressed in dorsal horn neurons and astrocytes, but their functional
significance in the spinal cord is still elusive. We recently generated vesicular glutamate transporters 2 (Vglut2,
an excitatory neuron marker) conditional STIM1 and STIM2 knockout (KO) mice. Our pilot data showed that
deletion of STIM1 in Vglut2+ neurons attenuated nociception, but did not affect pruritogen-induced scratches. In
contrast, ablation of STIM2 in Vglut2+ neurons (v-STIM2 KO) markedly attenuated pruritogen-induced scratches,
but had no effect on nociception. These exciting pilot work suggests that STIM1 and STIM2 play distinct roles in
pain and itch. Our pilot data also show that inhibition of STIMs by intrathecal, not intradermal injection, decreased
histamine (His)- and chloroquine (CQ)-induced itch behavior. Moreover, inhibition or deletion of excitatory
neuronal STIM2 attenuated FITC- and DNFB-induced chronic itch, suggesting that neuronal STIM2 play a role
in both acute and chronic itch. Importantly, STIM2 expression was increased in the dorsal horn from
diphenylcyclopropenone (DCP)- and 1-fluoro-2, 4-dinitrobenzene (DNFB)-induced mouse models of chronic itch.
GRPR plays a critical role in itch transmission. Our pilot data showed that deletion of STIM2 in Vglut2 or Lbx1
(specifically expressed in spinal and hindbrain neurons)-expressing neurons drastically attenuated GRP-induced
Ca2+ responses and itch behavior. It is known that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and
its downstream lipocalin-2 (LCN2) are key modulators of chronic itch. We found that activation of TLR4
upregulated STIM2 expression via STAT3 signaling. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that spinal STIM2
plays a crucial role in chronic itch through a combination of neuronal and astrocytic signaling pathways. In Aim
1, we will determine whether ablation or knockdown of spinal STIM2 attenuates chronic itch. In Aim 2, we will
examine the expression and function of STIM2 under chronic itch conditions. In Aim 3, we will investigate the
mechanisms underlying spinal STIM2 involvement in chronic itch. The proposed work will establish a novel role
of STIM2 in itch sensation and will provide new insights into the mechanisms of GRPR in itch transmission.
Successful completion of this research will not only identify STIM2 as a key modulator in chronic itch, but also
decipher the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying chronic itch."

Racial/ethnic minority populations in the United States face pervasive disparities in health care access,
utilization, and outcomes. Access to transportation is an important environmental factor that has the potential to
affect access to care. Past work has found that low-income and minority populations in the United States
encounter disproportionate barriers accessing transportation, and that improved transportation has significant
impacts on both health care utilization and outcomes. Little is known, however, about the extent to which the
Medicaid non-emergency medical transportation (NEMT) benefit is associated with racial/ethnic disparities in
health care access and outcomes. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to determine how
transportation services and related policy are related to health care disparities in the United States and can be
used to improve health equity. The overall objective of this project is to provide evidence for state and federal
policymakers on who uses the NEMT benefit, how use and disparities in use correlate with state-level NEMT
program design, how eligibility and use correlate with patient outcomes, and barriers to use for populations most
likely to have meaningful transportation needs to access care. The central hypothesis is that use of the NEMT
benefit, and the association between use and health care access and outcomes, vary substantially by
race/ethnicity and across beneficiary populations, as a function of discrete features of states’ NEMT policies and
administrative requirements. These hypotheses will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) examine
racial/ethnic disparities in beneficiary-level NEMT utilization across states and assess the correlation between
observed disparities and state-level NEMT policies; (2) estimate the association between use of and eligibility
for the NEMT benefit and health care access and outcomes, as well as heterogeneity in this association by
race/ethnicity; and (3) investigate the process of NEMT benefit administration and use of NEMT to identify
barriers to effective NEMT use and potential ways to improve the program. Methodologically, the project will
employ rigorous quasi-experimental approaches, including difference-in-differences analyses, as well as semi-
structured interviews with Medicaid beneficiaries, health care providers, and transportation providers. The
proposed research is innovative, in the applicants’ opinion, because it fills critical gaps on the potential for the
NEMT benefit to reduce health care disparities in the United States using quantitative findings from a large, multi-
state data source paired with in-depth, qualitative research on barriers to NEMT use. It also relies on a multi-
stakeholder advisory board composed of Medicaid beneficiaries, policymakers, clinicians, and transportation
providers to inform the research design and maximize translation to policy. The project is significant because it
will provide actionable guidance for state and federal policymakers on how to optimize the design of the NEMT
benefit to ensure equitable access to medical care in the United States."
10883773,"Extremely high rates (>50%) of primary graft dysfunction (PGD) due to ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) are the
predominant cause of impaired post-lung transplant outcomes resulting in both short-term mortality as well as
chronic lung allograft rejection. PGD is driven by the recruitment of neutrophils into the allograft which, upon
extravasation into the alveolar space, undergo NETosis to cause irreversible lung injury. We and others have
found that depleting neutrophils can ameliorate PGD but is not clinically feasible given their importance in
pathogen clearance. Accordingly, in the prior funding period, we focused on understanding the mechanisms that
drive neutrophil trafficking to the lung following transplantation. Our work facilitated the discovery of a fascinating
multicellular signaling pathway that underlies PGD: A) donor-origin Ly6ClowCCR2- non-classical monocytes
(NCM) retained in donor lungs release neutrophil chemokine CXCL12 to recruit recipient neutrophils, B) bone-
marrow derived recipient Ly6ChighCCR2+ classical monocytes (CM) stored in the spleen are mobilized to the
allograft through donor NCM-dependent activation of donor alveolar macrophages (AM), C) upon entry into the
allograft, the CM permeabilize the pulmonary endothelium through IL-1β dependent downregulation of zona
occludens-2 and tight junction protein Claudin-5 to enable extravasation of recipient neutrophils. Experiments
performed in the prior cycle and additional preliminary data further suggested that the CM are activated through
toll receptor signaling (TLR) and the release of IL-1β is NLRP3 inflammasome dependent. Excitingly, our data
uncovers a novel function of the spleen in priming bone marrow derived CM to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome.
Single cell transcriptomics and high resolution spatial intravital imaging indicated that the splenic metallophilic
macrophages released TGF- to recruit CM to the spleen independent of CCR2-CCL2 axis while the red pulp
macrophages primed them release IL-1β through the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, a process that required
3 days. These data fundamentally change the understanding of the spleen from a monocyte reservoir into an
active immune organ necessary for a coordinated response to injury. Collectively, our data strongly support the
hypothesis that after lung transplantation, IL-1 released by spleen-primed CM recruited to the lung is
dependent on TLR signaling and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. We will test our hypothesis using two
aims: Aim 1. Determine the mechanisms of activation of CM after migration from spleen to the transplanted lung.
Aim 2. Determine if spleen functions as both a reservoir and site for monocyte priming to mediate lung allograft
injury. Our experimental design takes advantage of our models of sequential spleen and lung transplantation as
well as state-of-the-art techniques such as spatial intravital imaging and single cell/spatial transcriptomics. We
will use complementary genetic and pharmacological techniques to perform causal experiments to prove our
hypothesis while creating a rich molecular atlas of human ischemia reperfusion injury. These studies will facilitate
the rapid translation of our findings to clinical practice."

A remarkable brain attribute is a lifelong ability to store and retrieve information for learning and memory.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) destroys this function and generates enormous personal, familial, and
societal impacts. This situation is further compounded by the lack of disease-modifying therapies and
continuous failures of the related clinical trials. An incomplete understanding of the disease has
severely limited the development of new treatments, calling for mechanistic research in AD. Synapse
loss has been a hallmark of AD and shows the most robust correlation with the disease symptoms. This
process occurs long before massive neuron death and AD diagnosis, indicating its central role in
disease pathogenesis. However, molecular mechanisms underlying synapse degeneration remain
incompletely understood. Our proposal aims to study this process by investigating a novel paradigm in
which a sarm1-dependent mechanism contributes to AD synapse loss. Sarm1 is a newly identified
NAD+ hydrolase enriched in axonal terminals, but its role in synapse degeneration in AD is entirely
unknown. We hypothesize that sarm1 plays a crucial role in AD onset and progression by inducing
axon and synapse degeneration. This hypothesis is formulated based on our preliminary data showing
that sarm1 gene knockout significantly alleviates AD mice's synaptic disruptions and cognitive
dysfunction. We will evaluate this hypothesis using new mouse models, cognitive assays, biochemistry,
electrophysiology, and super-resolution imaging. To this end, we have assembled an outstanding,
interactive team of investigators with substantial expertise in synapse biology, neurocircuitry, mouse
genetics, and AD pathology. We propose three specific aims: 1) define the role of sarm1 in memory
disruption and disease progression in AD mice; 2) evaluate sarm1 function in axon and synapse
degeneration in AD brains; 3) illustrate molecular mechanisms of sarm1 action in the context of AD
pathology and its impact on β-amyloid pathology. Through the proposed work, we will test a
fundamentally new concept essential to a long-standing question of AD—synapse loss—and
investigate sarm1-dependent signaling mechanisms in AD-associated neurodegeneration. The results
will advance the current knowledge on AD pathogenesis and provide critical insights into its novel
treatments by targeting the sarm1 signaling pathway. This proposal is submitted in accordance with the
Grant Notice to Specify Interest (NOT-AG-21-041 of PAR-22-093)."
10862800,"Project Summary
The short-term goal of this proposal is to understand how Yap/Taz/Cyr61 signaling influences remodeling of
the liver parenchyma during acute and chronic injury. This proposal will functionally define the response of
non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) to changes in epithelial Yap/Taz/Cyr61 signaling and validate candidate
signaling pathways that lead to NPC activation and recruitment. Our long-term goal is to understand the
intimate interactions and cellular decisions made by liver cells to generate a well-compensated organ.
Successful completion of this project would augment our ability to tailor medical therapies for cirrhosis and its
sequela by focusing on particular arms of Yap/Taz/Cyr61 signaling.
For several years, we studied the role that Yap plays in orchestrating regenerative responses. While Yap (and,
its paralog Taz) have long-established roles in regulating cell proliferation, they are increasingly being
recognized as having important non-cell-autonomous roles in proper tissue regeneration. Yap and Taz share a
similar biochemical structure but are differentially expressed after injury. Our work as well as of others suggest
that Yap and Taz are differentially activated in liver injury and, likely have common and distinct biochemical
targets mediating their injury response. We propose to closely examine our models of Yap and Taz activity that
lead to fibrosis to dissect common and distinct mechanisms for each molecule. We will further refine our
understanding of Cyr61, a widely reported Yap/Taz target which has been reported to have both pro- and anti-
fibrotic roles.
In Aim 1, we will interrogate the cell-cell interactions after hepatocyte-specific activation of Yap (Yap-Tg) with
immune cells, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, and fibroblasts using next-generation sequencing and
advanced imaging approaches. Chemical and genetic approaches interrogating potential drivers of the
phenotype will be used in the Yap-Tg model to examine its effects on hepatic stellate cell activation. In Aim 2,
we developed a hepatocyte-specific Taz overexpression model with distinctive characteristics from Yap-Tg.
This Taz model displays less inflammation, but a similar degree of fibrosis as the Yap-Tg model suggesting it
drives unique biochemical mechanisms. We will characterize the Taz fibrotic microenvironment of this model
and perform in-depth genomic and transcriptional profiling of Yap-Tg versus Taz overexpression. Aim 3 will
investigate potential mechanisms that Cyr61 can operate as a pro-fibrotic and anti-fibrotic molecule depending
on the injury setting.
We propose that a detailed understanding of epithelial Yap/Taz/Cyr61 signaling in liver injury, their cellular and
biochemical targets will inform the field regarding critical checkpoints to limit or reverse cirrhotic development.

10907464,"Project Summary/Abstract
Overeating and unhealthy eating are often associated with various health risk conditions such as obesity, high
blood pressure, and some chronic diseases. To get a better understanding of overeating and unhealthy eating,
researchers often rely on self-reports provided by individuals. Suggestions regarding changing lifestyle is often
provided based on observations from these self-reports. However, it is well known that self-reports can be
erroneous and subject to reporting biases. Thus, an objective way to measure the eating activity and validating
self-reports is necessary. Recently, there has been growing interest in moving beyond self-reports and
monitoring the eating activity automatically. To monitor automatically, and in real time, researchers have looked
at using sensor data from wrist worn devices, neck-worn devices, or ear-worn devices to automatically detect
eating. These devices often enable capturing the eating periods. However, these devices seldom capture
images, thus limiting the possibility of visually confirming the consumed food and their quantity.
With the increasing popularity of wearable cameras, it is gradually becoming possible to capture the eating
activities and associated context automatically and without any user intervention. Advances in machine learning
enables automatically extracting eating related information from these captured images. However, wearable
cameras often capture more information than necessary, like capturing bystanders. This unnecessary
information capturing reduces participant's willingness to wearing the camera. Currently, no camera exists that
can capture the eating activity and at the same time limit capturing unnecessary information. Obfuscating the
unnecessary information might increase participant's willingness to wear the camera. However, it is unclear if
and which obfuscation technique will increase participant's willingness to don the wearable camera and at the
same time ensure automatic context determination. In this project, we will determine the possibility of using
machine learning to detect eating in videos and identify the obfuscation technique that can allow detecting the
eating activity without collecting unnecessary information.
To this end, first we will develop an activity detection algorithm that will allow detecting the eating activity using
data from an IR sensor array and RGB images. Next, we will test various obfuscation methods in a cross-over
trial and select the best obfuscation method based on the greatest participant acceptability. We will then deploy
the eating detection algorithm with the best obfuscation approach on a novel wearable camera that has an
infrared sensor array. We will use this camera to test the possibility of detecting eating in a real-world setting. To
validate our algorithm, we will ask people to confirm or refute predicted eating and non-eating moments. We will
compare the performance of this algorithm against both real-time user response and 24-hour dietary recall to
objectively evaluate the algorithm's performance. Our proposed system will improve current research practices
of evaluating dietary intake and pave the way for personalized interventions for behavioral medicine."

 Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4α (HNF4α), a master regulator of liver-specific gene expression, is regulated by
two promoters (P1 and P2) which drive expression of two groups of HNF4α isoforms referred to as HNF4α1
and HNF4α7. HNF4α is a known regulator of gluconeogenesis and mutated in maturity onset diabetes of the
young one (MODY1). Conventionally, it was thought that HNF4α1, but not HNF4α7, is expressed in the normal
adult liver, while HNF4α1 is downregulated and HNF4α7 is upregulated in liver cancer. Now, research in our lab
reveals a previously undescribed role for HNF4α7 in the normal adult mouse liver – one involved in the diurnal
variations of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. More specifically, HNF4α1 appears to be a major driver of
gluconeogenesis while HNF4α7 is a driver of ketogenesis: we propose that alterations in the levels of the HNF4α
isoforms during the day flip the molecular switch between the two. Our preliminary data also show that HNF4α7
is required for increased levels of circulating ketone bodies in female mice. AMP-Activated Protein Kinase
(AMPK), an energy-sensing enzyme, has been shown to phosphorylate HNF4α1 in vitro, but effects in vivo and
on HNF4α7 are not known. SIRT1 is a deacetylase that works with AMPK to regulate glucose and lipid
metabolism. HNF4α1 is known to be acetylated and our preliminary data suggest that HNF4α7 but not HNF4α1
interacts with SIRT1. Here, we propose to use HNF4α1-expressing (α1HMZ) and HNF4α7-expressing exon
swap mice (α7HMZ) to determine the physiological function of the HNF4α isoforms in the switch between
gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis, and to characterize the impact of sex on those functions. In Aim 1, we will
determine whether intermittent fasting and a ketogenic diet increase the levels of HNF4α7 in the liver, and
whether the increase occurs in all hepatocytes, or just a subset. We will determine the consequences of HNF4α7
on gene expression. Kidney and intestines will also be explored. In Aim 2, we will determine whether the AMPK
pathway acts in a differential fashion on the HNF4α isoforms to help flip the metabolic switch. Phosphorylation
by AMPK and deacetylation by SIRT1 will be explored. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine whether the estrogen
pathway impacts the HNF4α isoforms in female mice and determine the consequences for the metabolic switch.
 Our compelling preliminary data that the HNF4α isoforms are involved in the switch between
gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis shed new light on this basic metabolic process that occurs on a daily basis
and under conditions of feeding and fasting. The results from this proposal will illuminate not only the molecular
mechanism underlying the switch but also how that mechanism is impacted by sex. The proposed studies have
the potential to impact our understanding of numerous metabolic diseases, including diabetes, obesity, fatty liver
disease and cancer. Finally, given the fact that ketone bodies serve as a source of fuel for the brain, our results
could have a broader impact, including on neurological diseases, such as dementia."
10870164,"This COGA (Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism) spinoff application aims to understand
structural/functional features in key brain networks (Default Mode Network (DMN), Executive Control Network
(ECN), Reward/Salience Network (RSN)) underlying the critical transition from regular drinking to DSM-5
Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) in young adult offspring from enriched COGA families, by combining newly
ascertained structural, diffusion and functional (s/d/fMRI), Neuropsychological (NPsych) and Electrophysiological
(EPhys) data together with existing multimodal longitudinal data (85% with 3+ assessments). The well-
characterized, genetically informative COGA sample with many offspring from families densely affected with AUD
at higher risk to develop AUD will be moving through the understudied age of young adulthood/early midlife (20's,
30's), when most longitudinal AUD development studies end and when our data predicts that a substantial portion
from high density families will transition from regular alcohol use to AUD. This proposal will target 150 young
adults (mean age 26) from the COGA study who are current regular drinkers (1/month+ for >6 months, but do
not currently meet criteria for DSM-5 AUD), and will follow them longitudinally with a multimodal approach to
compare those who transition to DSM-5 AUD and those who do not. We will add s/d/fMRI measures that are not
part of the COGA protocol, to provide anatomical specificity to complement current and existing NPsych and
EPhys longitudinal data during resting state, and three analogous cognitive/affective tasks [response inhibition
(Go/NoGo), reward processing (monetary gambling task), and affect modulation (cognitive/affective Stroop)].
Combining machine learning methods, advanced nonparametric, linear mixed methods, survival model, and joint
models of longitudinal data and survival data, we will: (Aim 1) identify features in specific neural circuits (DMN,
ECN, RSN) during resting state and during cognitive/affective tasks in young adults who transition from regular
drinking to AUD diagnosis from those who do not; (Aim 2) study the effects of drinking behaviors (e.g. age,
pattern, duration of alcohol use) on the s/d/fMRI, EPhys, and NPsych features in specific neural circuits
associated with the transition to AUD identified in Aim 1; and (Aim 3) determine the role of polygenic risk as
measured by polygenic risk score (PRS) derived from alcohol use- and brain-related GWAS, other risk/protective
factors [i.e., sex, race/ethnicity, family history, comorbid substance use (nicotine, cannabis), and psychiatric
disorders (depression), COVID-related traumatic stress] on neural circuits and their developmental trajectories
associated with transitions to AUD identified in Aims 1 and 2. The strength of our diverse, genetically informative,
enriched high-risk sample of young adults, longitudinal multimodal measures, and novel integrative analyses
will elucidate vulnerabilities and reciprocal relationships among neural circuits, genomic and other
risk/protectives factors in the transition to AUD during the 20s and 30s, with utility in prevention and treatment
initiatives."

Mitochondria function as the powerhouses of the cell and are essential to cellular and organismal health.
Conversely, mitochondrial degeneration and dysfunction are hallmarks of human diseases including
developmental and metabolic disorders, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's
disease, cancer, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular diseases. Consequently, several surveillance strategies
have evolved consisting of molecular chaperones and energy-dependent proteases that protect mitochondria
from damage. Mitochondria possess a representative member of every stress-inducible chaperone family; thus,
providing a paradigm to elucidate the function of the ensemble of molecular chaperones in proteostasis
maintenance. It is widely appreciated that molecular chaperones provide the first line of defense against protein
misfolding by promoting the correct folding and preventing aberrant folding and aggregation. Mitochondrial
chaperones are also widely expressed in most tumor cell types, including colorectal, breast, prostate, and
ovarian cancer, which have the highest mortality rates, indicating a central role of mitochondrial chaperones in
the immortalization of cancer cells and underscoring their significance as promising anti-cancer drug targets.
The broad and long-term research objective is to provide a molecular understanding how mitochondrial
chaperones maintain proteostasis under physiological conditions and how their function is modulated in
pathological states. Specifically, we will focus on the structural analysis of a novel ATP-dependent mitochondrial
chaperone using X-ray crystallography and cryoEM, determine its protein interactome using functional
proteomics, and use a structure-guided mutagenesis approach to elucidate its biological function in vitro and in
living cells. Addressing an important biomedical problem using a multi-pronged approach at different resolution
and time scale underscores the significance and impact of the proposed research."

Despite the fact that radiation therapy is one of the three primary modalities used in the treatment of
cancer, the active number of researchers in the fields of radiation biology or physics has been in
decline over the past three decades. The Summer Undergraduate Program to Educate Radiation
Scientists at the University of Pennsylvania (SUPERS@PENN) was proposed as a means to begin to
reverse this recognized crisis. We hypothesize that by providing undergraduate students with a
supportive environment that teaches them the underpinnings of cancer and radiation biology, physics
and imaging, early in their college careers, that we will encourage a significant number of these
students to ultimately pursue cancer and radiation research as a career path. A key thrust of our
training program is to identify and recruit participants from various underrepresented populations,
thereby promoting greater diversity among radiation scientists. Initially submitted in 2009, the
program obtained strong support from study section (score 11, 1.0 percentile) received NIH funding in
2010 and was successful in competitive renewal in 2015. We have continued to successfully meet the
proposed aims of the program, with a large percentage of our alumni (including minority,
socioeconomically underprivileged and female gender) having now moved on to graduate programs,
with a continued focus on an eventual career in cancer and radiation research. Our goal for this
competitive renewal is to continue to build upon these robust successes. Individualized research
projects tailored to each student's interests and experience remain as the core component of the
SUPERS program. In addition, didactic lectures from faculty experts in the fields of cancer biology,
radiation biology, radiation physics and cancer imaging provide a foundation for students. Four hours
of bioethics training are incorporated into the didactic lecture series, as per NIH requirements. We
continue with the programmatic assessment and evaluative component. Working with colleagues in
the Office of Evaluation and Assessment in the Academic Programs at the Perelman School of
Medicine, SUPERS has developed methodologies to measure the immediate and long term impact of
the program on student participants as they transition from undergraduate to post-baccalaureate
studies and eventually into the early part of their research careers. In summary, by completing the
specific aims underlying this proposal, we anticipate that we will continue to have a positive impact on
quantity, quality and diversity of the next generation of scientists engaged in cancer and radiation
related research."
10898754,"Vaccination is currently the best method for preventing influenza virus infection and for reducing disease severity. Unfortunately, current vaccine regimens suffer from several major drawbacks and efficacy can vary dramatically year to year. Improved vaccine strategies are desperately needed. Preclinical testing is critical for evaluating potential safety and immunogenicity of next generation influenza virus vaccine candidates. Mice are an ideal first model organism because there are a wealth of reagents and genetic tools allow refined experimental approaches and the capacity to do rigorous mechanistic studies, longitudinal kinetic analyses, sampling of mucosal tissue, and assessment of protection through lethal challenge, all at low cost. While mice are not natural hosts for influenza virus infection they can still recapitulate many aspects of human disease. Additionally, some strains are directly pathogenic while others can be readily mouse adapted. Unfortunately, many therapeutic interventions that were successful in mice have failed to translate to humans. This could be due to several factors including species genetic differences and/or environmental factors. We have previously demonstrated that exposing SPF laboratory mice to diverse pathogens from pet store mice recapitulates many of the human cellular and molecular immune signatures absent in standard mouse models. Preliminary studies demonstrate that heterologous protection and influenza-specific serum antibody isotypes are dramatically altered in ‘dirty’ cohoused (CoH) compared to SPF mice, which more closely resemble what has been observed in humans. We hypothesize that CoH mice will better predict immune responses to influenza infection and vaccination compared to standard mouse models. We will test this hypothesis in three aims. Aim 1 will compare the immune response to a panel of adjuvants used in humans between SPF and CoH mice. Where available, we will compare transcriptional profiles to human data. Aim 2 will determine how a diverse infection history impacts the generation, function, and durability of influenza-specific memory T cells, including extensive analyses of lung immune surveillance.to influenza virus infection and vaccination. Aim 3 will determine the immune response to live attenuated, seasonal split and adjuvanted split vaccinations in SPF and CoH mice. This aim will also evaluate the immune response to less immunogenic targets of universal influenza vaccines. Collectively, this proposal will rigorously evaluate the immune response to influenza virus infection and vaccination in mice with diverse infection histories and immune signatures that more closely align with humans. We propose that the intrinsic advantages of the CoH mouse model will significantly complement ferret or other large animal models to improve the pipeline for preclinical testing and enhance translation potential of next generation influenza virus vaccines."

Age-related and metabolic diseases such as type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and sarcopenia have
become a worldwide epidemic that affects the quality of life of millions. To give a global perspective, roughly
343.8 million people in the world have type-2 diabetes today, and 175 million do not know they have diabetes at
all. Metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and osteoporosis, are strongly linked to longitudinal changes in body
composition, morphology and function.
 Modern medical imaging technologies offer the opportunity to study the composition and morphometry of
human body in ways that were previously impossible. Contemporary imaging studies that are performed in vivo
on a large number of participants have enabled cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of age-related and
metabolic diseases, and effects of pharmacological interventions. The emergence of advanced imaging
technologies has also created the need for automated image analysis techniques for identification and
quantification of morphological patterns of anatomies and tissues and their changes with increasing age.
 This project will contribute novel and non-invasive medical image analysis techniques for studying the human
body composition to achieve timely prognosis of these pathologies. Our research interests will concentrate on
identification of morphological patterns in the mid-thigh, abdomen and lower leg that will eventually lead to
development of imaging biomarkers. The accumulation of adipose tissue in the human body and changes of its
regional distribution are associated with type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and the metabolic syndrome.
Age-related changes in skeletal muscle composition are strongly linked to loss in muscle strength and mass,
frequently termed as sarcopenia, leading to decreased mobility and function. Also, trabecular bone structural
changes are associated with osteoporosis. We will use imaging and clinical data collected by the Baltimore
Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) that is the longest ongoing epidemiology study in the US.
 This work will address a technical and a clinical hypothesis. The technical hypothesis is that quantitative
image analysis can accurately and robustly segment, register and fuse body composition data acquired by
modern MRI and CT imaging scanners. The clinical hypothesis is that qualitative body composition phenotypes
on clinical imaging can be used as biomarkers for prognosis and diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome
manifestations. We will build on recent advances in medical image analysis to contribute novel and non-invasive
techniques for studying the human body composition and its longitudinal changes with main applications in tissue
identification and quantification at the mid-thigh, lower leg and the abdomen (aim 1). Then we will develop
statistical machine learning methods to achieve timely diagnosis and prognosis of metabolic and age-related
conditions including the metabolic syndrome and osteoporosis, and to track the effect of interventions (aim 2)."

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating disease with upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction
and degeneration leading to progressive weakness and death due to dysphagia and respiratory failure. There
is an urgent need to develop effective treatment to stop or reverse the progression. However, this has proven
to be challenging due to an incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis and delay in the diagnosis of ALS.
There are data supporting biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction, energy expenditure (EE) and body
weight/composition as early indices of incident clinical disease. Identification of these markers could facilitate
earlier intervention to prevent or delay disease progression as well as provide information on therapeutic
targets in individuals at genetic risk for ALS. I hypothesize that 1) the plasma lipid mediators (lipidome) can
accurately differentiate ALS, and primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) subjects from controls 2) body
weight/composition and EE differ between C9orf72+ ALS, presymptomatic C9orf72 mutation carriers
(C9orf72+ Pre-ALS) participants and controls 3) certain metabolic profiles will predict symptom onset in
C9orf72+ Pre-ALS participants. In this proposed study, I will 1) investigate the plasma lipidome profile of ALS
and PLS subjects to identify lipid mediators as diagnostic biomarkers in motor neuron disease, 2) evaluate
body weight/composition and EE in C9orf72+ ALS and Pre-ALS to measure changes in energy metabolism
in advance of and through the course of disease, and 3) follow a cohort of C9orf72+ Pre-ALS participants
annually to track the emergence of ALS symptoms and signs to determine if certain metabolic profiles predict
symptom onset in this genetically predisposed population. Successful completion of this project would provide
key data to 1) establish the lipidome profile as a diagnostic biomarker for ALS and PLS, and 2) provide the
foundation for a prospective cohort study of C9orf72+ Pre-ALS individuals to determine if the lipidome profile
and metabolic markers (body composition, EE) could serve as a premonitory marker for the phenotypic
conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic ALS. This K23 award will provide the support needed to
complete the proposed research and to further develop my expertise in three major scientific areas, 1)
expertise in lipidome data production and analysis, 2) expertise in metabolism and EE, and 3) mastery of
advanced statistical techniques for clinical applications. I will leverage the research training I receive in the
K23 to lead a longitudinal cohort study of pre-ALS participants to determine the relationship between
metabolic changes and clinical manifestations of ALS. My overarching goal is to identify early diagnostic
biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the development of an effective treatment to prevent or delay the
progression of ALS."

Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease cause a significant socioeconomic burden. These
diseases manifest as protein plaques in the brain tissues. As of today, there are no available drugs to treat
or prevent these diseases. For rational drug design, it is essential to understand the atomic details of the
proteins involved in these plaques. To achieve this, researchers utilize structural biology methods such as
electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM), nuclear magnetic resonance, and X-ray crystallography.
Neuropathologists isolate these plaques from post-mortem patient brain tissues and assess the disease for
the presence of plaques. Then the samples are subjected to structural studies. Since 2017, a significant
number of atomic structures of the protein molecules involved in the plaques have been reported. However,
isolation of proteins from tissue samples is a bottleneck due to low yield, differences in the protein structures,
and the presence of contaminants. The proteins in the plaques have a distinct arrangement in that they form
a β-strand conformation and stack on top of each other along a helical axis. This arrangement gives rise to
a unique property – they bind to molecules such as thioflavin and exhibit characteristic fluorescence emission.
Such a property enables researchers to know the presence of protein plaques and quantify them in cellular
models. Here, we propose to utilize the specificity of thioflavin to protein filaments of neuropathological
plaques as a new method of plaque purification. The method combines the specificity of thioflavin to the
protein filaments and affinity-based purification methods that are widely used to purify proteins. We propose
that our method would enable researchers to extract and isolate protein filaments from brain tissues with
much improved yields, fewer contaminants, and shorter processing times."
10881884,"Multi-material decomposition using spectral CT provides quantitative information on tissue composition. This
information is beneficial for many clinical applications including CT imaging of the cardiac vasculature and the
abdomen. Clinical implementation for spectral CT has taken different paths, such as using dual-source, fast
kVp switching, and photon counting or sandwich detectors; each of these solutions has its own strengths and
weaknesses. In particular, the limited spectral diversity of existing solutions limits the number of differentiated
materials, leaving many clinical questions unanswered. The unmet clinical need for a satisfying spectral CT
solution that is capable of multi-material decomposition motivates this proposal. We propose a practical
solution to spectral CT using stationary spectral encoding. This technique is simple enough to be implemented
at low engineering cost on all energy-integrating CT scanners. The key element in our solution is a ring-
shaped, stationary spectral encoder that can be attached to the CT gantry opening. The spectral encoder is
made of thin materials of spectrally diverse properties arranged around its perimeter. As the x-ray tube and the
detector rotate around the patient, the emitted rays are continuously modulated by the encoder materials,
thereby providing essentially endless possibilities in terms of spectral diversity. Multi-material decomposition is
accomplished by advanced material decomposition algorithms that reconstructs the material maps directly
from the spectral encoder CT data. The goal of this proposal is to develop and optimize the spectral encoder
towards future physical construction and clinical evaluation studies. In Aim 1 we will build a computational
platform to generate the spectral encoder CT data, and develop material decomposition algorithms. In Aim 2
we will optimize the stationary spectral encoder design parameters for the best possible material
decomposition performance. These aims collectively provide a practical pathway for clinical translation: the
results from these aims will guide prototype development, which then will be followed by real data acquisition
with physical phantoms and patient studies. The proposed spectral encoder can be used for all CT scanners
and will make multi-material decomposition widely available."

Signaling and adhesive interactions between neighboring cells play an important role in developmental
processes, helping determine cell fates and identities, migration pathways, and ultimately cellular function.
Currently the best method for characterizing cell to cell contacts is through ultrastructural studies. These
provide a wealth of information, but are technically complex, tedious to perform, and require extensive analysis
to identify specific interactions of interest.
We are working to develop a method of cell to cell contact tracing that provides useful information at the optical
microscopy level. Using synthetic notch receptors and the ligands they recognize, it is now possible to design
and genetically encode a touch sensitive detection system that operates in vivo. We have chosen the
CD19/synNotch receptor system utilized in CART therapy to detect contacts between cells. In our version,
recognition of the the CD19 ligand displayed on one cell surface activates a synNotch receptor on an opposing
surface, inducing the cleavage and release of a transcriptional activator that induces the expression of a
fluorescent marker protein.
We are working to perfect a cell to cell contact tracing methodology in the developing olfactory system of the
zebrafish. Zebrafish have a number of advantages for this study. Among them are excellent access to all
developmental stages, a rapid generation time, outstanding optical properties for imaging, and easy
transgenesis. The olfactory system has simple, well characterized circuitry and cell-specific promoters are
available to drive transgenic expression in specific classes of olfactory sensory neurons. The aim of this project
is to identify the cells an olfactory sensory axon contacts as it extends from its origin in the olfactory epithelium
to its target in the olfactory bulb. This information is crucial for understanding how these sensory axons home
in on specific target regions within the bulb."

Early life adversity is a potent predictor of health and disease burden during middle and late
adulthood, as well as earlier, all-cause, and specific disease mortality. Even more disturbing,
longitudinal studies suggest that experiences of early life adversity appear to be biologically
embedded such that improved later life circumstances have only modest ameliorative effects.
Thus, it is critical to investigate how adversity becomes biologically embedded at an early age.
We propose to examine the early biological embedding of health and disease risk in young
children’s telomeres, a biomarker of cellular aging. Telomeres naturally shorten with each cell
replication (cellular aging) and erode most rapidly in the first years of life, reflecting a sensitive
period of development. We propose a novel longitudinal study to examine the effects of prenatal
and postnatal early life adversity (i.e., poverty, parent conflict, maternal stress) on accelerated
biological aging, including telomere erosion and epigenetic aging clocks, across the first three
years of life. We also propose a novel examination of developmental context (i.e., parenting
quality) and child behavioral (i.e., self-regulation) mediators in these pathways to elucidate
potential mechanisms that may contribute to the early origins of health and disease risk.
Participants (n = 200) will be drawn from a prospective longitudinal cohort study funded by NICHD
(Brain and Early Experience Study; R01 HD091148-01A1). Early life adversity will be assessed
via maternal report at prenatal (28 week’s gestation) and postnatal home visits (6 mo). Parenting
quality (sensitivity and harsh intrusiveness) will be assessed via videotaped and coded mother-
child interactions at the 6-month visit. Child self-regulation will be assessed via videotaped and
coded child observations at the 27- and 36- month home visits, as well as maternal report.
Biospecimens (i.e., saliva) will be collected from mothers and children at the 6-, 27-, and 36-month
visits and assayed for telomere length at all three time points and DNAm conversion will be
performed to provide epigenetic aging clocks at the 6- and 36- month time points.
The proposed study will be the first to investigate potential linkages between early life adversity,
parenting quality, child self-regulation, and biological aging during this critical period in early
childhood when telomeres are eroding most rapidly and may be most susceptible to
environmental input. Our long-term goal is to determine how early adversity becomes biologically
embedded in early childhood in order to prevent or mitigate risk to later health and wellness.
Findings will provide important information to help in the development and/or optimization of early
risk-mitigating intervention and prevention efforts to improve the quality of life for children."

benefits of these new therapies to infants and children remains a significant challenge. Important developmental
changes in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, disease presentation and progression all impede direct
translation of adult therapeutics into pediatrics. The discipline of pediatric clinical pharmacology provides
necessary training in developmental physiology to leverage existing knowledge and guide rational therapeutics
for infants and children. However, the current pool of pharmacologists and pediatric sub-specialists with formal
training in clinical pharmacology is both small and aging. Additional pediatric clinician-scientists with training in
clinical pharmacology are urgently needed to ensure that therapies are optimized for infants and children. In
2015, under the leadership of Edmund Capparelli, PharmD (expert in pediatric pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling)
and Adriana Tremoulet, MD, MAS (expert in pediatric clinical trials), training in pediatric clinical pharmacology at
UC San Diego was formalized as a NICHD-supported T32 Training Program. We are proud of this first iteration
of a formal program to provide cutting-edge research training in pediatric clinical pharmacology. We now propose
a renewal of our T32 pediatric clinical pharmacology training program, entitled “Academic Training in Therapeutic
Advancement for Child Health” (ATTACH). In this renewal, we proudly seek to (1) modernize our program with
new program leadership, (2) recruit more world-renowned faculty to teach our fellows state-of-the-art
technologies, (3) launch a systematic tool to assess performance of our program and assist in program
improvement, (4) emphasize trainee and faculty mentor training, and (5) enhance recruitment methods to attract
a more diverse pool of applicants and trainees to stimulate diversity in the workforce. Our key objectives of the
first cycle of our training program will remain the same: (1) To increase the number Pediatric clinical
pharmacologists and Clinician-Scientists engaged in clinical pharmacology research as applied to child health;
(2) to attract outstanding young pediatric clinicians to UCSD and to expand their translational capacity through
clinical pharmacology methods; (3) to facilitate career development of ATTACH trainees under the guidance of
world class, established investigator-faculty mentors; and (4) to cultivate the early careers of women and minority
investigators in pediatric therapeutics. With our impressive group of mentors with outstanding training track
records, UCSD ATTACH Fellows will be poised to be tomorrow's leaders in pediatric clinical pharmacology."

The nervous system and immune system communicate with each other to respond to infections
and maintain immune homeostasis. Work over the last two decades has shown that the vagus
nerve is a critical pathway for neuro-immune communication carrying motor signals descending
to the body, in addition to sensory signals ascending to the brain. These pathways comprise the
two arcs in the neuro-immune reflex circuit termed the inflammatory reflex, in which neural activity
on the vagus nerve regulates cytokine production in the spleen. While the functional and
molecular mechanisms of the descending motor pathway to the spleen are well-established in
this reflex, it is unclear how vagal sensory neurons detect and represent information about
inflammation in situ. This unknown mechanism is a critical piece of the ascending sensory arc of
the inflammatory reflex. Therefore, the goal of the proposed studies is to use large-scale calcium
imaging to discover how vagal sensory neurons encode and represent information about specific
inflammatory mediators. By monitoring vagal sensory neurons while they are presented with
inflammatory mediators of the innate immune response (e.g. pro- and anti-inflammatory
cytokines, DAMPs, PAMPs), we aim to uncover a neural code both at the population-level and at
the level of individual sensory neurons. This new understanding will provide crucial mechanistic
insights into the nervous system representation of immune signals as a general principle, which
can be used to understand what goes wrong in a host of inflammatory disorders that involve
immune dysregulation.
 With a team of experienced scientists who are experts in the neural regulation of immunity, we
will use techniques and approaches adapted from sensory neuroscience to determine how vagal
sensory neurons encode information about inflammatory mediators. This new fundamental
understanding of neuro-immune communication will potentially provide new mechanistic insights
about disorders of disrupted immune homeostasis. It may also lead to the identification of new
targets and strategies for vagus nerve-based neuromodulation to treat a host of inflammatory
disorders."

The blood protein von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a large multimeric protein that, when activated, binds to
blood platelets tethering them to the site of vascular injury initiating blood coagulation. This process is critical
for normal haemostasis, but especially under inﬂammatory conditions it is thought to be a major player in patho-
logical thrombus formation. For this reason, VWF has been the target for the development of anti-thrombotic
therapeutics. However, a particular challenge is how to prevent pathological thrombus formation while still allow-
ing normal physiological blood coagulation. In fact, currently available anti-thrombotic therapeutics are known
to cause intracranial bleeding as side eﬀect. The work presented here proposes that by identifying the confor-
mational changes that VWF undergoes in inﬂammation it will be possible to design molecules that target VWF
selectively only in an inﬂammatory pro-thrombotic environment. Experiments performed in vitro have indicated
that oxidizing agents released during inﬂammation increase the platelet-binding activity of VWF, and this has
been linked to the oxidation of methionine residues within VWF. This study aims to characterize what inhibitory
mechanisms are removed in VWF through methionine oxidation and identiﬁes sites that can be targeted optimally
under oxidizing conditions. We hypothesize that oxidation activates the A1 domain (the domain in VWF that
contains the binding site to platelets) by removing the masking function of its neighboring domains. Through
a combination of a dynamic ﬂow assay, equilibrium unfolding experiments and a binding assay, we will identify
which auto-inhibitory mechanisms of VWF are turned oﬀ by oxidation and which methionine residues are key for
activation under oxidizing conditions. This knowledge will then be used in computational docking studies to create
a model of the complex between the A1 domain and its neighboring domains and study the structural eﬀects of
methionine oxidation at atomic level of detail. An assay using samples from patients with inﬂammatory conditions
will be used to test the link between inﬂammatory conditions and higher activity of VWF in vivo. The structural
insights gained here will be invaluable to structure-based drug design in order to develop therapeutics that target
VWF only when it is in its oxidized state in order to prevent thrombosis while allowing haemostasis."
10879110,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The disorders collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are characterized by aberrant
immune responses to the commensal microbiota. The establishment and maintenance of tolerance to the
microbiota is accomplished via a complex and dynamic network of cells and molecules that collectively stave
off immune reactivity. Elucidation of the mechanisms whereby these natural pathways limit immunity to
normally benign commensals, especially those that occupy niches at the epithelial border, will ultimately
enhance our ability to target these interactions for the prevention and/or treatment of intestinal inflammation.
We hypothesize that high-affinity, thymus-dependent (T-dependent) antibody responses are essential for the
regulation of mucus-associated bacterial communities. T-dependent antibody responses are especially
important in the host response to pathogenic invasion of the gut. Since some helpful commensal species
utilize similar mechanisms as pathogens to establish a niche in the mucus layer lining the intestinal epithelium,
it stands to reason that similar immune mechanisms are deployed to control these organisms. We have found
that mice colonized with a minimal mucus-associated consortium display a predominantly T-dependent IgG
response. Moreover, mice with impaired production of T-dependent antibodies have significantly diminished
total antibody responses to antigens derived from mucus-associated bacteria including specific flagellins
derived from members of the family Lachnospiraceae. Colonization with mucus-associated bacteria, or the
deficiency of T-dependent antibodies in the presence of such organisms, coincides with increased production
of the immunoregulatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) by CD4 T cells in the large intestine. Accordingly,
simultaneous disruption of these 2 pathways results in spontaneous colonic inflammation. In this proposal, we
will utilize defined microbes and the antigens they generate to elucidate the mechanisms whereby interactions
between flagellated mucus-associated bacteria and the gut immune system promote tolerance of these
communities. In addition, we will explore novel roles for T-dependent anti-commensal IgG1 in the
establishment and maintenance of immune homeostasis. If successful, our studies will define the mechanisms
whereby TD anti-commensal antibodies promote immune normalcy at the colonic epithelial border and
constantly mitigate the risk of deleterious reactivity to the diverse community of mucus-associated bacteria."

A quantitative understanding of the tissue microenvironment (TiMe) is critical for advancing biomedical
knowledge and healthcare, ranging from regenerative medicine to managing the burden of cancer. To train
productive scientific leaders, education in three technological areas is essential: (a) sensing and imaging to
measure biochemical and biophysical properties, (b) bioengineering to recapitulate the TiMe, and (c)
computational modeling and analytics to gain insight. Accordingly, we propose to continue the TiMe training
program wherein predoctoral students integrate the three technological approaches with TiMe-related biological
contexts of disease and development to launch successful research careers. Training includes four core
components—Curricular Activities to ensure technical depth and critical thinking with apposite breadth across
disciplines, Extracurricular Activities to develop pragmatic skills, Professional Development to empower trainees
to become research leaders, and Career Development to position trainees to make lifelong contributions to
society. The activities are structured to streamline education and efficient focus on research with the awarded
doctoral degree to include a special designation (concentration in TiMe). This past project period was our first
and progress was made in establishing the program, its activities and evaluation to refine it further. Building upon
the success of trainees (all ten graduated are in biomedical research careers, ~5.5. papers per trainee, and
significant follow-on funding and awards), we propose to continue student development activities, add a novel
hands-on education component based on a newly constructed laboratory and emphasize emerging scientific
topics including machine learning and design thinking. Illinois has exceptionally strong disciplinary programs,
diverse faculty spanning the program, appropriate facilities and unique resources in each of these technological
areas. The TiMe Training Program is distinctly advantaged by our strong history of successful graduate training,
including a commitment to diversity and individuals with disabilities, a culture of productive collaboration, a new
Department of Bioengineering, and strong institutional support (matching direct support - $1.5 M and $2.9 M of
total support). Forty faculty will serve as faculty mentors and another four, with expertise in pedagogy, evaluation
and professional development, provide critical resources for the program. We propose to educate at least twelve
trainees (six from NIH support and six matching slots from Institutional support) for up to two years each. Six
trainees will be appointed annually from a strong applicant pool across campus. Traditional education will further
be enhanced by co-mentored research with possibilities of translational opportunities via a new engineering-
based College of Medicine. Outcomes will be rigorously evaluated throughout the program to improve training,
to guide administrative decision-making and to disseminate best practices. The vision, expertise, and
infrastructure of the Illinois TiMe Training Program will ensure that trainees selected from a strong and diverse
graduate community will provide sustained research contributions to benefit public health."

This multi-PI proposal is a collaboration among tissue engineers and an orthopaedic surgeon to develop a liquid
cartilage filler, called chondrogel, that would be efficacious in repairing gouge and focal defects of the knee using
an arthroscopy approach. Chondrogel is formed using extensively passaged, allogeneic rib chondrocytes that
have retained their ability to form mechanically robust neocartilage that is phenotypically akin to articular cartilage
(e.g., production of collagen II and lubricin, absence of collagen I and X). Preliminary data show that chondrogel
fills gouge defects in explant culture and also in vivo after 16wks in the minipig knee. We have also developed
arthroscopic techniques for the minipig. In this proposal, we will show that, in addition to gouge defects,
chondrogel will be effective in healing focal defects as well when administered arthroscopically. This will be
achieved in two aims. In Aim 1, we will examine chondrogel 1) to show that, in addition to 20x1mm gouge defects,
chondrogel is capable of filling focal defects 5mm in dia. in explant culture (Aim 1, Phase I), and 2) to find the
maximum arthroscopic intraarticular pressure where chondrogel is still retained in gouge and focal defects (Aim
1, Phase II). In Aim 2, we will determine if chondrogel heals gouge and focal articular cartilage defects in the
minipig using arthroscopy. Because chondrogel has been designed based on surgeon surveys and because it
is based on rigorous science demonstrating its ability to form cartilage, successful completion of this proposal
would allow the use of arthroscopy to treat cartilage defects."

Aphasia is a common and disabling outcome following stroke. Although some treatments are available in the
acute phase, people with chronic, severe deficits rarely have meaningful recovery. Frequently, these patients
have phonological or articulatory planning deficits, while their semantic functions are preserved. Because of
this, a novel treatment modality in these patients is a speech brain-computer interface (BCI) designed to
decode semantic activity. In this project we are developing a machine learning model to decode brain activity
to concept identities, to be used in such a device. We will first develop the model in patients with no language
deficits using invasive electrical recordings. During awake brain surgeries, we will place high-density
electrocorticography (ECoG) grids on prespecified brain locations corresponding to high-level semantic areas.
Patients will perform a semantic decision task, and the neural network model will be trained to predict concept
identities from the recorded ECoG activity using a semantic model developed by our lab. We will then
demonstrate the application of this model to people with aphasia by performing the same task using the
noninvasive magnetoencephalography (MEG) in people with severe aphasia. Demonstrating that this model
can be used to decode concept identities from brain activity, and that it is applicable to people with severe
aphasia, will open up a new avenue of treatment for this population."

Rates of obesity and severe obesity are expected to continue to rise to alarming levels. By 2030, over 51% of
adults in the US are expected to have obesity with a 130% increase in severe obesity. These staggering rates
and projected future increases are deeply concerning given the substantial disease and economic burden of
obesity. As severe obesity rates continue to rapidly rise, the use of metabolic and bariatric surgeries (MBS) is
expected to increase. MBS is the most effective treatment for severe obesity and results in impressive acute
and long-term weight loss, as well as improvement of medical and psychosocial comorbidities. Yet, weight
outcomes are markedly variable after MBS, suggesting that surgery alone is not enough for a sizeable
subgroup with severe obesity. Weight regain after MBS is common and a major concern, particularly because
weight regain is associated with recurring or even worsening medical comorbidities. Despite the need for
ongoing obesity treatment after MBS due to the chronicity of obesity and risk for regain, there is little guidance
as to what treatment(s) should be provided based on empirical data. In fact, no prospective studies or
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have examined the effectiveness of pharmacologic agents and very few
(and limited) RCTs have examined behavioral weight loss (BWL) to enhance weight losses following MBS.
Thus, rigorous RCTs combining pharmacological and manualized BWL treatment to enhance weight outcomes
after MBS is an imperative next step to reduce personal and public health costs of obesity. To help fill this
critical gap in the MBS field, the proposed RCT will test the effectiveness of a rigorous manualized BWL and a
FDA-approved weight-loss agent (naltrexone+bupropion/NB), alone and in combination, for improvements in
weight loss, cardiovascular risk factors, and psychosocial functioning. N=160 patients with obesity (BMI≥30 or
≥27 with a medical comorbidity) who underwent MBS and have suboptimal weight outcomes will be randomly
assigned (double-blind) in balanced factorial (2 X 2) design, to one of four 24-week conditions: BWL+NB,
BWL+Placebo, NB-only (No BWL), or Placebo-only (No BWL). Outcome variables were determined based on
the leading rigorous weight loss RCTs for obesity with NB, NIH ADOPT guidelines, and conceptually-relevant
variables for NB and BWL. Independent outcome assessments will determine outcomes after discontinuation
of treatments through 18 months. The proposed RCT will provide important new clinical findings regarding the
utility and effectiveness of pharmacotherapy and BWL for a rapidly growing obesity subgroup and will inform
care models for managing chronic obesity to enhance outcomes after MBS. This will be the first RCT to 1) test
any pharmacologic treatment for obesity after MBS; 2) examine BWL and NB, alone and in combination, for
weight loss and associated features in patients who have undergone MBS; and 3) examine the durability of
treatment effects from combined treatment modalities by including long-term follow-up assessments after
treatment delivery."

Tumor suppressor genes represent a major class of oncogenic “drivers” and offer robust window for therapeutic
intervention. However, direct targeting loss-of-function tumor suppressor genes remains challenging, because
that majority of tumor suppressors do not have enzymatic activity and exert their normal function through protein-
protein interaction (PPI). Noteworthy, a unique class of tumor suppressor mutations are missense mutations
encoding single amino acid substitutions that impair the normal PPI. These tumor suppressor mutations are
defined as “loss-of-interaction” mutation. We aim to directly target the “loss-of-interaction” tumor suppressor
mutations through discovery of small molecule PPI inducers to restore their anticancer functions. SMAD4 is such
a tumor suppressor with “loss-of-interaction” mutations in cancer that disrupt its normal PPI with SMAD3. Using
SMAD4 as a proof-of-concept study, we propose to utilize our newly developed TR-FRET SMAD4-SMAD3 PPI
screening platform to reveal novel small molecule mutant SMAD4-PPI inducer (MuSMADid) that can induce
the mutant SMAD4 PPI with SMAD3 and restore the pathway and cellular response to the tumor suppressive
TGF-b signaling. Preliminary studies showed that the SMAD4-SMAD3 TR-FRET assay is robust and scalable in
1536-well uHTS format and is sensitive to monitor the SMAD4-SMAD3 PPI dynamic at single amino acid
resolution. From a bioactive chemical library, Ro-31-8220, a bisindolylmaleimide derivative, was identified as
potential MuSMADid that induced the mutant SMAD4 PPI with SMAD3 and restored the responsiveness of
SMAD4 mutant colon cancer cells to the TGF-b anti-proliferation signaling. Identification of Ro-31-8220 as a
potential MuSMADid provides strong evidence for direct targeting “loss-of-interaction” SMAD4 mutations.
Together, this preliminary data supports our central premise that novel chemical probes can be discovered as
potential MuSMADid by leveraging the established uHTS TR-FRET assay to screen structurally diverse chemical
libraries. Based on the stages of discovery research, our proposal will focus on Aim 1 “Primary Screen
Implementation” to identify MuSMADid hits with new chemical scaffolds, followed by verification with orthogonal
PPI assays, and on Aim 2 “Functional Validation” to prioritize a list of validated novel small molecule anti-tumor
MuSMADid for future hit-to-lead optimization phase. We will use the uHTS TR-FRET platform to rapidly identify
primary hits and validated hits followed by characterization of their PPI induction and cellular activities in restoring
the TGF-b tumor suppressive signaling. Accomplishing the goals of the proposed study is anticipated to generate
a list of prioritized and confirmed small molecule MuSMADid compounds that show potent biochemical and
biological activities in inducing the mutant SMAD4-SMAD3 PPI and restoring the TGF-b anti-proliferation
signaling pathways. Top ranked anti-tumor MuSMADid with the strongest structural and functional evidence will
be used as chemical probes to study the mutant SMAD4-dependent cancer biology and as candidates for future
hit-to-lead studies towards the development of novel small molecule MuSMADid drug for precision oncology."

The long-term goals of this project are to define the mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapy and to develop
effective therapies for patients with metastatic bladder cancer (BC). The overall objective of this proposal is to
establish successful combination therapies for patients with a specific genomic subset of metastatic BC
harboring homozygous deletion of the methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) gene from the chromosome
9p21 region. Although novel immune checkpoint therapy (ICT), including anti-PD1/PD-L1, provides substantial
benefits to patients with metastatic BC, response rates are usually modest at 15% to 25%. This is partly because
this biologically heterogeneous cancer is still treated clinically as a uniform disease. Therefore, identification of
specific genomic subtypes of BC that confer insensitivity to ICT may provide novel opportunities to improve
clinical responses. We have confirmed that ~1/4 of BC contain homozygous deletion of MTAP (MTAPdef) from
the 9p21region. The MTAP gene encodes for an essential enzyme to catalyze methylthioadenosine (MTA) in
the salvage pathway for adenine synthesis. Tumor MTAPdef leads to both immunologic and metabolic
consequences. Immunologically, tumor MTAPdef results in accumulation of its substrate MTA, which acts through
the adenosine 2B receptor (A2BR) to inhibit IFN signaling and T cell function. Therefore, MTAPdef BC may foster
a “cold” tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) unfavorable to ICT. Metabolically, tumor MTAPdef results in a
lack of salvage pathway adenine synthesis; thus, MTAPdef BC should be very sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of
anti-folate agents (e.g., pemetrexed), which effectively inhibit de novo adenine synthesis. This concept is
confirmed by pre-clinical and clinical data to be presented. Importantly, our data also indicate that pemetrexed
increases tumor immune cell infiltration and PD-L1 expression and thus may sensitize BC to ICT. Based on
these data, we hypothesize that, by targeting the metabolic vulnerability of MTAPdef BC and directly modulating
its tumor immune microenvironment, effective combination therapies can be established for MTAPdef BC. To test
this hypothesis, we proposed two Specific Aims: (1) Define the immunological consequences of MTAPdef in BC;
(2) Identify successful combination therapies specifically targeting MTAPdef BC. Patient-derived BC tissues, gene
knockout and “rescue” mouse BC models, and samples from an IRB-approved clinical trial will be used to
address these goals. At completion, we expect to establish the contribution of MTAPdef and/or loss of adjacent
genes such as CDKN2A in the 9p21 region to the BC TIME. In addition, we will determine the extent of TIME
modulation by pemetrexed +/- avelumab (anti-PD-L1) in relation to their therapeutic efficacy in patients with
metastatic BC. Furthermore, we will define the preclinical therapeutic benefits of triple combination treatment
with pemetrexed, anti-PD-L1, and A2RB inhibitor on mouse MTAPdef BC. These findings are important for the
establishment of novel, biomarker-guided, highly effective combination therapies that can be tested in clinical
trials. These data could be extrapolated to 14% of all cancers containing MTAPdef in the 9p21 region."

For millions of people living with HIV (PLHIV) receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), adequate ART adherence
and routine HIV viral load (VL) monitoring are critical to ensure viral suppression and good health outcomes.
Initiation and management of life-long ART in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is challenging for both
PLHIV and providers in part due to the reliance on self-reported adherence and delays with lab-based VL testing,
which are part of the usual care. Drs. Drain and Garrett (co-principal investigators) recently completed a pilot
study in South Africa demonstrating that point-of-care (POC) VL monitoring for PLHIV receiving efavirenz-based
ART increased VL suppression and retention in care by 14% (95% CI 6-21%) over a 12-month period compared
to standard lab testing. However, the applicability of these findings to the context of newer, more robust
dolutegravir-based ART regimens being introduced in several LMICs, including South Africa, is not known. To
complement POC VL monitoring, we have recently completed the development and initial evaluation of a novel
POC urine tenofovir assay, in collaboration with Abbott Diagnostics, which can monitor ART adherence in clinic-
based settings in real-time. Building on our pilot study results, our objective in this application is to determine the
clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness of implementing an integrated HIV care model using POC tenofovir
adherence testing and POC VL monitoring in maintaining durable VL suppression among PLHIV receiving
tenofovir-based ART in South Africa. Our central hypotheses are that POC tenofovir adherence testing and POC
VL monitoring will improve VL suppression rates and retention in care, while being a feasible, acceptable, and
cost-effective strategy for ART management. We will objectively test our central hypotheses with three specific
aims: (1) to determine if an integrated model for HIV monitoring using a POC tenofovir adherence assay and a
POC VL test will improve VL suppression and retention in care; (2) to monitor implementation and assess patient
and provider perspectives of real-time POC tenofovir adherence testing and POC VL monitoring in South Africa;
and (3) to estimate the costs and cost-effectiveness of implementing POC tenofovir adherence testing with POC
VL monitoring, compared to no objective adherence testing and lab-based VL monitoring. To complete these
aims, we will randomize 534 participants (1:1) at ART initiation into regular POC tenofovir adherence testing with
POC VL monitoring (Arm 1) or standard-of-care with no objective tenofovir adherence testing and lab-based VL
monitoring (Arm 2). Participants will be followed to compare a primary composite outcome of VL suppression

implementation trial will provide crucial data on the clinical efficacy, acceptability, and cost-effectiveness of an
integrated model of POC adherence and VL testing to inform global policy on improving HIV care in LMICs."
10929388,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PRODUCT EVALUATION AND MANIPULATION CORE
The goal of the Product Evaluation and Manipulation Core (PEMC) is to support and complement the human
research conducted in the Projects (P1-P4) and pilot studies needed to inform the evidence base surrounding
how the three nicotine dimensions (concentration, form, and isomer) affect tobacco product appeal,
addictiveness, and toxicity. Our Center focuses on novel tobacco products that have a credible potential for harm
reduction in established cigarette smokers or smokeless tobacco users. However, there are significant data gaps
regarding key product characteristics and appeal to nonusers; which is concerning given their high prevalence
of use and recent rapid increase in sales. The PEMC will generate product characterization data, which, in
concert with P1-P4 results, will accomplish our Center's objective: provide the evidence needed to clarify a
pathway for meaningful harm reduction in established tobacco product use, while limiting the appeal of novel
tobacco products for youth and adult never smokers. A firm understanding of tobacco product design
characteristics, including chemical, physical, and bacterial properties, is central to the Industry's Consumer
Response Model. Therefore the PEMC plays a critical role in our Center's integrative theme “Flipping the
Script”: Using the Industry's Nicotine Playbook to Maximize Public Health, as we endeavor to generate the
data needed to fuel regulatory policies that maximize public health and not industry sales. The PEMC specific
aims are to 1) Precisely manipulate the three nicotine dimensions in EC liquids to evaluate their effect on human
behaviors, mainstream emissions, and cellular toxicity; and 2) Employ an array of physicochemical analytical
methods to quantify nicotine dimensions, other ingredients, and contaminants, in tobacco products, and 3)
harmful and potentially harmful constituents and other toxicants in their emissions. The PEMC will be led by Prof.
Marielle Brinkman and Dr. Ahmad El Hellani, who have extensive experience manipulating and characterizing
tobacco products to inform tobacco regulation in both Tobacco Regulatory Science Center and standalone
grants. The OSU-TCORS PEMC proposes a highly integrated and diverse set of physicochemical analytical
capabilities, a successful track record in the manipulation of tobacco products to inform regulation, and a strong
emphasis on qualifying all measurements with a robust quality control program."
10929392,"PROJECT SUMMARY – MARKET MONITORING CORE
The landscape of the tobacco market continues to increase in complexity by product and design, with the intent
to maintain tobacco use and nicotine addiction. Given the tobacco industry's history of manipulating nicotine in
tobacco products to drive product appeal, use, and addiction, timely market surveillance is critical to monitor
industry trends and changing tobacco use patterns. The primary objective of the Market Monitoring Core (MMC)
is to conduct rapid marketplace surveillance of ECs, novel oral nicotine pouches (ONP), and other non-
combustible and combustible products, thereby facilitating the design, interpretation, and regulatory impact
assessment of Projects 1-4 with rich marketplace data. Specifically, the MMC will use complementary data
sources and novel methodologies to track products and their packaging claims, including the Nielsen Retail
ScanTrack data, online store website data scraping (i.e., extraction), and direct contact of vape shops and
specialty stores. The MMC will play an important role in: 1) guiding the identification of the most appropriate
ONPs to be characterized by the Product Evaluation and Manipulation Core (PEMC) for Project 2 (P2); 2)
informing the experimental design of P3 by providing product packaging information from the marketplace,
including the existence/placement of nicotine-related claims and visuals, to generate stimuli and allow P3 to
anchor their study design based on evolving market shares, selecting products and packaging designs that best
represent market conditions; 4) assisting P1-P4 in formulating and designing surveys, such as providing drop-
down lists of popular brands and nicotine options in questionnaires, and comparing Project data with marketplace
data to accurately contextualize the potential translational impact in dissemination activities (e.g., publications,
presentations, and FDA public docket submissions); and 5) fostering the development of relevant Career
Enhancement Core-supported pilot studies that address emerging products and regulatory interests. The
specific aims are to: 1) monitor the nicotine dimensions (concentration, form, and isomer) and other features
(e.g., flavor, promotion, etc.) of ECs and ONPs for P1-4; 2) identify ONPs for evaluation and characterization by
the PEMC for P2; 3) monitor how EC and ONP manufacturers market nicotine dimensions using packaging
claims for P3; and 4) facilitate experiment and survey design by providing marketplace information (e.g., product
popularity, and market shares) of a wide range of nicotine and tobacco products for P1-4. The MMC supports
innovative research by providing timely marketplace information that is critical to study designs. The MMC also
has the capacity to assess market share changes in response to FDA policies, further facilitating the center's
mission to advance regulatory impact analysis."

10660031,"Neurological conditions account for over 6% of the global disease burden.1 There are more than 600 neurological
disorders and cognitive dysfunction, also referred to as intellectual disability (ID), occupies a prominent position
in this list. Cognitive dysfunction arises from the failure of neuronal cells to organize into a complex network and
remodel this network in response to learning and experience. It is manifested by deficits in adaptive behaviors
in everyday social and practical skills. Due to its high prevalence,1; 2 and the lifetime cost of care per individual
in the range of $1-2 million in United Sates (CDC), it presents a significant health burden. Genetic and functional
studies of the genes and protein determinants of ID have helped to elucidate the molecular pathways of human
brain development in health and disease. However the identity of a large number of essential molecular and
cellular components still remain elusive. Building upon the resources generated during prior funding years, the
Objective of this renewal grant is to expand the genetic repertoire of causal ID genes and characterize their role
in neurons structure and cognitive function. The rationale is that identification and functional elucidation of
causative gene variants that lead to cognitive dysfunction will be essential for understanding brain function and
for developing improved diagnostic tools and efficacious preventive and therapeutic agents for neurological
disorders including ID. There are 3 aims of our comprehensive research program: 1) Ascertain and clinically
phenotype members of extended families segregating autosomal recessive intellectual disability (ARID); 2)
identify new ARID genes and gene products; and 3) determine the functions of prioritized novel ARID genes
using multifaceted approaches, including analysis of spatiotemporal expression patterns in mouse brain,
targeting in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, effects on cell morphology and synapse abundance, synaptic
transmission and plasticity in neuronal cells by electrophysiology and live-cell imaging assays. The project will
advantageously combine human clinical assessment, genetic and functional analyses relevant to brain
development and function. Impact: Execution of the proposed studies will generate new knowledge that is
clinically relevant, with high potential to impact ID molecular diagnosis, prognoses, and identify novel therapeutic
targets to slow progression, delay onset, and possibly devising precision medicine approaches for ID."
10767992,"Title:
Development of the resident macrophage lineage in mouse and human
Summary/abstract
Our long-range goal in our previous funded RO1 application was to elucidate mechanisms that underlie the
development and specification of embryo-derived tissue-resident macrophages in mice. Our program of work
aimed to understand how the identities and functions of resident macrophages are specified and to provide tools
and concepts to identify pathophysiological mechanisms underlying their roles in developmental, inflammatory,
degenerative and tumoral diseases. This work allowed us to identify key novel functions of resident macrophages
and mechanisms that underly these functions and to develop new genetically tractable models which pave the
way for our current project. Yet, a comprehensive understanding of the developmental origin and functions
of mammalian resident macrophages, which has essential implications for genetic and pharmacological
investigations of their specialized functions, still faces several important challenges, which are identified
and addressed in this renewal proposal. 1) The development of resident macrophage in mice cannot be
directly extrapolated to humans because the earlier steps of extraembryonic hematopoiesis and macrophage
development present with differences among vertebrates, for example between Zebrafish and mice, and are
overall poorly understood. Notably, 2) the early hemato-endothelial progenitor(s) that give rise to EMPs and
HSCs are still elusive, which impairs our ability to fully characterize resident macrophages. In addition, 3) it is
important to elucidate the roles of individual LDTFs and their subset-specific combinations for the control of
tissue-specific functions of macrophages, because, in addition to identify molecular mechanisms that underly
macrophage functions, these studies have the potential to unveil therapeutic strategies for leveraging
macrophage functions in human. We propose to take advantage of novel genetic tools to identify the hemato-
endothelial progenitors that generate the macrophage lineage in mice (AIM1), to identify conserved
macrophages progenitors in human using a genetically tractable model for hematopoietic differentiation in human
induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived embryoid bodies, and to take advantage of this versatile in vitro
model to characterize the role of macrophage LDTFs in the control of macrophage tissue-specific functions
(AIM2). We expect that our results will provide a robust experimental basis to transform and improve our
understanding of the cellular, genetic, and molecular determinants of resident-macrophage development in mice
and, importantly, in human, and provide important genetic tools for the molecular understanding and
manipulation of their functions in physiology and diseases."
10827477,"Title: Contribution of IL6 trans signaling in older females after ischemic stroke
Abstract: Women have worse outcomes after ischemic stroke than men. Multiple factors influence the outcomes including sex chromosome complement (XX vs. XY), sex hormones (estrogens vs. androgens), and immune responses. IL6 is a key inflammatory cytokine, and higher levels of IL6 are associated with poor stroke outcomes. Downstream signaling after IL6/IL6 receptor interaction is mediated through the JAK/STAT3 pathway. The biological impact of this signaling cascade in aged females after stroke is unknown. Our long-term goal is to dissect sex-dependent molecular mechanisms that regulate IL6/IL6R signaling after ischemic stroke injury; as this discovery will facilitate targeted therapeutics in elderly females. The objective of this proposal is to determine the role of microglia IL6R in long-term functional outcomes after stroke, including for motor outcomes as well as for post-stroke vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). The central hypothesis is that IL6/IL6R signaling plays a detrimental role in the progression of cerebral injury in aged females, and dysfunctional microglia IL6/IL6R signaling contributes to poor long-term functional recovery after stroke. Our specific aims will test the following hypothesis: Exaggerated inflammation in aged females after stroke is a consequence of enhanced IL6/IL6R trans-signaling (Aim 1); the second X chromosome contributes to enhanced IL6/IL6R signaling in aged females (Aim 2); Microglia IL6/IL6R trans-signaling in older female mice heightens neuroinflammation and exacerbates functional deficits after stroke, include post-stroke VCID (Aim 3). Upon completion, we will understand the sex-dependent role of microglial IL6/IL6R signaling on functional outcomes after stroke injury, including cognitive decline. This contribution is significant since it will encourage experimental approaches to develop sex-dependent therapeutics for elderly stroke patients. We are also focused on exploring the sex differences in cognitive functions with age as it is well known that women are at higher risk for dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The proposed research is innovative because we will investigate the contribution of IL6R trans-signaling on stroke outcomes in older females, a heretofore unexplored avenue. Insights into sex-based signaling mechanisms are essential, as they can be modified by currently available therapy."
10821440,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) represents ≈50% of HF, with limited methods for
prevention and treatment. Current approaches to detect/treat HFpEF rely on cardiac phenotypes obtained at
rest, missing reserve capacity impairments in multiple organ systems central to HFpEF that are uniquely revealed
through exercise. In the first R01 period, we performed 3117 cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPETs) in the
Framingham Heart Study (FHS) to quantify cardiorespiratory fitness, individual exercise responses, and their
metabolomic signatures. We defined a “normal” metabolic response to exercise and reported novel measures of
impaired fitness and HF risk. Strikingly, ≈1 in 4 asymptomatic community-dwelling FHS participants displayed
fitness impairment that overlapped with individuals with hemodynamically confirmed HFpEF studied in our
clinical referral lab. Metabolites related to HFpEF physiology were also associated with exercise responses in
FHS. These results underscore a critical molecular and phenotypic overlap between clinical HFpEF and the early
stages of its development, providing a unique opportunity to define the origins of HFpEF and reveal new targets
for its screening/prevention. Proteins are potentially targetable biomarkers that provide a readout of specific
pathways relevant to multiple organs, have direct correlation with genetics, and have a well-defined process for
assay development. The hypothesis of this renewal is that molecular pathways related to precise HFpEF
phenotypes captured during exercise will specify mechanisms underlying HFpEF susceptibility long before its
usual clinical detection. We leverage 2 unique samples developed in the first period: (1) deeply-phenotyped
HFpEF patients with hemodynamic measures during CPET (MGH-ExS, N=500) and (2) FHS participants with
CPET and plasma samples at rest/peak exercise (N=1500). We will study a broad circulating proteome (>3000
proteins at rest/peak exercise) in relation to precise exercise phenotypes, in silico bioinformatics, and human
genetics to specify proteomic signatures of exercise response in 3 aims. In Aim 1, we identify pathways of organ-
specific responses to exercise in HFpEF (using the rest proteome) and their relation to subclinical phenotypes
central to HFpEF susceptibility in the community. In Aim 2, we will quantify changes in the circulating proteome
with acute exercise and evaluate how exercise-induced changes differ in the presence of HFpEF (MGH-ExS vs.
FHS) and HFpEF risk factors. In Aim 3, we measure association of proteomic signatures of HFpEF phenotypes
with incident HF and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in racially diverse primary prevention cohorts. We also
construct genetic instruments of implicated proteins (pQTLs) for association with HF/CVD in large biobanks using
Mendelian randomization. This application unites profiling of broad pathways with relevance to HFpEF with
unique, precise exercise phenotypes collected during the first grant period to resolve clinical heterogeneity in
HFpEF and to prioritize novel targets for earlier and more precise prevention. This project will provide a unique
resource for the scientific community, with all data made publicly available immediately upon completion."
10835077,"Project Summary
Post-translational modification of proteins by ubiquitin (Ub) is a regulatory mechanism that controls nearly
all aspects eukaryotic cell biology. Ubiquitination alters properties of target proteins such as stability,
subcellular localization, intermolecular interactions, and activity and thereby regulates processes such as
cell cycle control, DNA repair, signal transduction, and immunity. The relevance of Ub signaling to human
health is underscored by the fact that its dysregulation is implicated in pathologies such as cancer,
cardiovascular disease, and immune disorders and that it is a validated target for therapeutic intervention in
cancer with FDA-approved medications extending the lives of multiple myeloma patients.
Ub signaling requires the sequential interactions and activities of three enzymes, E1, E2, and E3, which act
in tandem to conjugate Ub to target proteins. The largest family of E3s, with more than 200 members, are
cullin-RING E3 ligases (CRLs) which are modular, multi-subunit complexes involved in a diverse array of
biological processes by functioning with the E2 Cdc34 to recognize substrates and catalyze the extension of
lysine 48-linked polyubiquitin (K48-polyUb) chains that signal for proteasomal destruction. One of the best
characterized CRL subfamilies are Skp, Cullin, F-box (SCF) RING E3 ligases which control cell cycle
progression by catalyzing K48-polyUb chains on key regulatory proteins at defined timepoints. CRLs are
also of intense interest therapeutically as they are hijacked by proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) to
catalyze K48-polyUb assembly on therapeutically important target proteins of interest. Despite their
fundamental importance biologically and therapeutically, many key questions regarding how Cdc34 and
SCF/CRL E3s function together at a molecular level remain, including: 1) How do Cdc34/SCF complexes
specifically catalyze K48-polyUb as opposed to other types of polyUb chains?, 2) What is the architecture of
the complete Cdc34/SCF E3/substrate/Ub donor/Ub acceptor complex during catalysis?, 3) What is the
structural basis by which CRLs catalyze PROTAC-mediated ubiquitination of substrate proteins?.
Through use of structural, biochemical/biophysical, and cell-based approaches, this proposal aims to
determine the structural basis by which Cdc34 and SCF function together to specifically assemble Lys48-
linked polyUb chains to control the cell cycle (Aim 1) and to determine the molecular mechanisms by which
PROTAC molecules with therapeutic potential hijack CRL E3 ligases to target proteins of interest for
ubiquitination and proteasomal destruction (Aim 2). Studying the system through this lens provides a unique
opportunity to gain deeper insights into both basic mechanisms of Cdc34/SCF/CRL E3 function as well as
into the mechanisms and molecular rules governing design of effective PROTACs that could ultimately
provide a platform for the development of novel therapeutics for cancer and other human pathologies."

Multiple pseudouridine synthases (PUS) are implicated in human disease, but the mechanisms
that connect loss of PUS activity to mitochondrial myopathy, digestive disorders, intellectual
disability, resistance to viral infection, dyskeratosis congenita, and diverse cancers remain
largely unknown. There are several critical gaps in our current knowledge of the functions of
PUS proteins. Although the basic biochemical activity of PUS proteins in catalyzing the
isomerization of uridine to pseudouridine is well understood, the specific RNA targets of most
human PUS proteins are unknown or incompletely known. Our long-term goals include
identifying the targets of all PUS proteins and determining the molecular consequences of
modification of specific RNAs with pseudouridine in disease-relevant cellular contexts. This will
be critical for understanding the etiology of diseases caused by PUS deficiency and may reveal
new therapeutic targets for treatment.
Our recent work (Martinez et al. Mol Cell 2022) established that pseudouridine (Ψ) is deposited
co-transcriptionally in nascent human pre-mRNA at thousands of sites where it is poised to
affect every step of mRNA metabolism from birth to death. This renewal application will
rigorously investigate the biochemical basis for mRNA regulation by pseudouridylation. The
biological effects of Ψ must originate in chemical differences between U and Ψ, which directly
affect RNA backbone conformation, the stability of base pairs, and the binding of proteins. Our
preliminary data establish that hundreds of pseudouridines are present within the experimentally
determined binding sites of regulatory RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and micro RNAs (miRNAs)
in human HepG2 cells. Widespread occurrence of Ψ in RBP and miRNA binding sites—together
with biochemical studies of artificially pseudouridylated RNAs that demonstrate the capacity of
Ψ to determine whether, and to what extent, an mRNA will be bound—establish a strong
premise for the proposed work. We will (1) Determine impact of mRNA Ψ on functional
interactions with regulatory RNA-binding proteins, (2) Identify the roles of pseudouridylation in
miRNA-mediated gene regulation, and (3) Define the contributions of regulated RNA
pseudouridylation to the control of gene expression.
Together, the proposed work will elucidate the molecular consequences of mRNA
pseudouridylation in human cells and define functionally relevant mRNA targets of human
pseudouridine synthases. This will fill a critical knowledge gap for understanding how RNA
modifying enzymes that are essential for human health control gene expression."
10820452,"ABSTRACT
Elongating RNA polymerase II (Pol II) can be blocked by a variety of DNA damage. The stalled Pol II prevents
passage of other RNA and DNA polymerases and blocks exposure of damage to repair proteins, leading to
apoptosis or mutagenesis. To avoid these detrimental outcomes, cells activate several mechanisms, including
transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER), to rescue the stalled Pol II. In human cells, the
Cockayne Syndrome B (CSB) protein is believed to bind to damage-stalled Pol II and initiate TC-NER.
However, there is a critical gap in knowledge concerning how CSB switches Pol II from elongation to a form
amenable to DNA repair. Additionally, TC-NER is best known to repair helix-distorting (bulky) DNA lesions, but
whether it also repairs non-bulky base damage that occurs more frequently in living cells is poorly understood.
To address these important questions, we developed genome-wide and single-nucleotide resolution
sequencing methods to map DNA lesions, including bulky cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs; UV damage)
and non-bulky N-methylpurines (NMPs; alkylation damage). Notably, our CPD-seq data indicates that yeast
Rad26, an ortholog of CSB, functions in displacing the transcription elongation factor, Spt4-Spt5, from the
stalled Pol II. This function of Rad26 is mainly required for gene coding regions downstream of the first (+1)
nucleosome. The eviction of Spt4-Spt5 likely disrupts the closed conformation of the Pol II complex, thereby
switching Pol II from elongation to repair. Furthermore, we identified a subset of genes in which TC-NER
across the entire coding region was independent of Rad26, suggesting both Rad26-dependent and
independent TC-NER mechanisms function in the yeast genome. How CSB functions and whether CSB-
independent genes exist in human cells are unclear. In this proposal, we will utilize an improved CPD-seq
method to generate genome-wide TC-NER profiles in CSB-proficient and deficient human cells. Comparison of
the two repair maps will help identify CSB-dependent and independent genes and guide investigation into their
underlying mechanisms (Aim 1). The binding of CSB to Pol II is the first step for TC-NER. Damage removal
requires the assembly of a large nucleotide excision repair (NER) complex on DNA. TFIIH is the next crucial
NER factor following CSB. Aim 2 will elucidate TFIIH recruitment to test the hypothesis that CSB-mediated
Spt4-Spt5 displacement leads to TFIIH binding to the stalled Pol II. Moreover, our NMP-seq data indicates that
TC-NER also repairs non-bulky alkylation lesions, suggesting TC-NER targets a broader spectrum of DNA
damage than currently appreciated. Aim 3 is based on this intriguing finding and will focus on TC-NER of
oxidative base damage, which is the most frequent endogenous damage with a profound role in cancer
mutagenesis. Hence, these proposed studies will use innovative approaches and significantly improve TC-
NER research by offering genome-wide insights for both bulky and non-bulky lesions."

Intellectual Disability (ID) and Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are the most common developmental
disorders, affecting 3-4% of children in the U.S, with few therapeutic options. Although insights into the
mechanisms that cause these heterogeneous disorders remains very limited, genetic studies of ID/ASD have
revealed a central role for mutations in genes encoding transcriptional regulatory proteins, including multiple
subunits of the SWI/SNF ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling complex (BAF complexes). For example,
heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in Arid1b, the largest subunit of the canonical BAF complex (cBAF),
are among the most frequent mutations observed in de novo ID/ASD cases. However, the function of
ARID1B/cBAF complexes in gene regulation during normal brain development and the specific developmental
processes that are disrupted by Arid1b loss-of-function mutations remain significant gaps in knowledge.
Characterizing the specific functions of transcriptional regulatory complexes in cell type-specific gene
regulation in the dynamic and heterogeneous cellular environment of the embryonic brain remains difficult
using current model systems and experimental tools. Our long-term goal is to develop pluripotent stem cell-
based model systems and experimental tools to characterize gene regulatory networks that control cell fate
specification during brain development. Towards this end, my lab recently developed a robust, reproducible
protocol to make forebrain organoids from mouse pluripotent stem cells. This reduced complexity model
maintains key features of the developing brain and can enable experimental approaches that are not possible
in vivo. Here, we propose to 1) perform the first in depth transcriptomic and epigenomic characterization of
cerebral cortex development in our novel mouse organoid model using single cell genomics approaches, 2)
define the impact of Arid1b loss-of-function mutations on cortical development in vivo and in organoids, 3)
implement chemical genetic approaches (dTAG) to parse stage-specific effects of ARID1B loss, 4) define
direct effects of ARID1B loss on gene regulation during cortical development, 5) determine which gene
expression changes are reversible upon reintroduction of ARID1B into post-mitotic cortical neurons. These
data will help to establish mouse cortical organoids as a model system that can complement and extend upon
in vivo approaches for studying molecular and cellular mechanisms of brain development. Our findings will
provide new insight into the mechanisms by which loss-of-function mutations in Arid1b give rise to changes in
gene regulation during early stages of cortical neurogenesis and reveal specific genes, cell types, and
developmental stages that are susceptible to reduction of cBAF complexes. Given the relevance of this
complex to common developmental disorders, our findings may also reveal novel therapeutic opportunities for
ID and ASD."
10831056,"Prenatal programming of child asthma and respiratory health is potentially influenced by maternal exposures,
such as a woman’s lifetime stress, although mechanisms of this biologic embedding have not been fully
delineated. Emerging evidence suggests that exposure to trauma can be a particularly robust potentiator of
biological events that increase vulnerability to asthma in offspring and may help explain increased risk found in
lower-income urban U.S. populations. Lower-income BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) women
experience traumas over their lifetime at rates above national U.S. samples. Research from our group has
shown that lifetime exposure to traumatic stressors in women, even when remote, impact stress-related
programming of respiratory disease starting prenatally. Oxidative stress (OS) resulting from an imbalance
between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant defenses is increasingly thought to play a central role
in asthma pathogenesis and lung growth and development. While evidence indicates that BIPOC populations
have increased OS, studies examining whether elevated OS, indexed using traditional biomarkers in prior
studies, in part explains health disparities have been mixed. Inconsistent findings may be a consequence of
select biomarkers used in prior studies. Moreover, the critical role placental OS plays in fetal programming is
increasingly appreciated with a high reliance on mitochondrial function to maintain optimal oxidant balance.
Chronic stress can result in dysfunctional mitochondrial processes and the accumulation of ROS-generating
mitochondria. Thus, higher order biomarkers deployed in multiplex panels considered as complex mixtures
and/or biomarkers of cumulative OS, may provide greater insight into underlying OS processes that vary
across populations. Finally, emerging evidence suggests that relationships between OS and disease outcomes
may be modified by underlying metabolic factors that vary by maternal race/ethnicity and body mass index
(BMI). This proposal will leverage a well-established urban, ethnically mixed longitudinal pregnancy cohort
study to examine associations among maternal lifetime stress, oxidative stress biomarkers, and children’s risk
for repeated wheeze and asthma and reduced lung function by age 6-7 years assessing for joint effects of
postnatal stressors and oxidative stress biomarkers. Maternal prenatal OS will be indexed by (i) a mid-
pregnancy urinary oxidative stress panel (OS mixtures) and (ii) placental mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
heteroplasmy. The proposed analyses will more comprehensively examine the role of OS in prenatal
programming of child asthma and early childhood lung function including placental mitochondriomics.
Accounting for modifying effects of maternal race/ethnicity and BMI may better inform observed disparities. In
addition, elucidating molecular mechanisms may lead to novel prevention and treatment strategies and
because of the central role of mitochondria in regulating the maternal-fetal interface, our findings may provide a
model that can be extended to additional prenatal risk factors and other fetal disorders."

 The study of craving for alcohol and drugs is increasingly thought to be essential for understanding the
pathogenesis and maintenance of addiction. However, valid and reliable methods for investigating this
psychobiologic phenomenon are lacking. This study seeks to develop a novel, ecologically valid paradigm that
capitalizes on the technological advances and realism of virtual reality (VR) to both induce alcohol craving, via
presentation of realistic alcohol-related cues, and reliably assess alcohol craving, via measurement of potential
craving correlates (attentional bias and spontaneous eye-blink rate [EBR]) and subjective reports. Following
initial acceptability testing and optimization (n=15), three alcohol active and three neutral VR scenes will be
administered to a sample comprised of low-moderate alcohol drinkers (n=50) and heavy alcohol drinkers
(n=50). Eye-tracking (to establish attentional bias towards alcohol cues) and EBR will be continuously recorded
during presentation of the scenes. Participants will then be followed for seven-days, via mobile assessment,
and contacted by phone at day 30, to obtain self-report responses of subjective alcohol craving and alcohol
use in their naturalistic environment.
 Thus, the specific aims of the proposed research are: (1) to develop an ecologically valid and immersive
VR cue-reactivity paradigm that reliably induces alcohol craving, (2) test the feasibility, reliability, and utility of
VR derived attentional bias as an objective craving correlate by comparing it against commonly used measures
of subjective craving and attentional bias, and (3) examine the predictive utility of the objective correlates of
alcohol craving acquired during the paradigm and subjective reports of alcohol craving and alcohol use during
follow-up. The use of EBR as an objective craving correlate will also be investigated as an exploratory aim.
 Once fully developed and tested, this paradigm will have tremendous applications within basic science
research on alcohol craving and within clinical science via providing a new platform to develop interventions
that aim to reduce craving. Further, this project will advance our understanding of attentional bias and its utility
as a predictive measure of alcohol craving and use."

 The United States (US) and Mexico have the highest prevalence of obesity in the world. In the US, Latinxs,
who comprise the largest ethnic minority group, have disproportionately high rates of poor diet quality, obesity,
and diet-related health outcomes. Food labeling is a low-cost, wide-reaching intervention for communicating
nutrition information to consumers so they can make more informed, healthier food choices. Between 2020 and
2021, the US is changing the Nutrition Facts Label (NFL) on pre-packaged foods, which will increase the
visibility of calorie amounts and serving sizes while introducing information on added sugar. NFLs have been
criticized, however, for their complexity and location on the back of packaging. Front-of-package (FOP)
nutrition labels provide more visible and simplified information on the nutritional value of foods, enabling
consumers to easily compare options at the point of product selection. Between 2020 and 2021, Mexico will
implement mandatory FOP warnings in the form of prominent “stop signs” on packaged foods that are high in
calories, sodium, sugar, saturated fat, or trans fats, as well as products with added caffeine or non-caloric
sweeteners. To evaluate the relative effectiveness of these new US and Mexican policies, the current proposal
leverages data from the International Food Policy Study (IFPS), which has annually surveyed approximately
4000 US and 4000 Mexican adults since 2018. Funding for Mexico ends in 2020, though funding is secured for
the US through 2024. Mexicans and US Latinxs with lower educational attainment – key groups with
disproportionately high obesity rates and for whom the FOP warnings may be most effective – have been
under-represented in IFPS surveys. The proposed study will continue annual surveys of Mexican consumers
through 2024 (n=4000/year) while providing an oversample of US Mexican Americans (MAs; n=2000/year)
who comprise approximately two-thirds of all US Latinxs. We will recruit additional samples of Mexicans
(n=1500/year) and MAs (n=1500/year) with lower education. This pre/post study will compare within- and
between-countries over time to address two aims. Aim 1 will evaluate the impact of the mandatory FOP
warnings in Mexico relative to NFL changes in the US. We hypothesize that increases in awareness/use of
nutrition labels, nutrition knowledge, and healthy dietary behaviors will be greater in Mexico than in the US,
including US MAs. Aim 2 will evaluate disparities in the effects of these nutrition labeling policies. We
hypothesize that awareness and use of FOP warnings, nutrition knowledge, and healthy dietary behaviors will
increase more from pre- to post-policy among disadvantaged groups in Mexico than in the US due to the
greater prominence and simplicity of the Mexican FOP warnings. Finally, we expect that post-implementation
trends in labeling effects among disadvantaged groups will favor the Mexican over US policy. The results from
this study will inform policy development in the US and globally, as well as communication theories that guide
product labeling to promote healthy behaviors."

Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are the only racial/ethnic group in the United States (US) for whom cancer
is the leading cause of death for both sexes. Thus, there is an urgent need for research focused on understanding
the mechanisms by which cancer disparities occur in this vulnerable patient population. Across the thyroid cancer
care continuum, which starts prior to diagnosis and treatment of cancer, Asians experience a disproportionate
burden of disease and death. Among Asian women, in particular, thyroid cancer is the second most common
cancer and thyroid cancer mortality is the highest of any racial/ethnic group in the US. Differential management
of thyroid nodules, a precursor of thyroid cancer, likely contributes to observed downstream disparities in the
thyroid cancer continuum. However, Asians continue to be underrepresented in both the cancer disparities and
thyroid literature, potentially exacerbated by the high rates of limited English proficiency in this population. Thus,
granular data on the quality of medical care received by Asian Americans across the thyroid cancer care
continuum is lacking. We propose using the paradigm of limited English proficient (LEP) Chinese patients with
thyroid nodules to improve our understanding of linguistic disparities across the thyroid cancer care continuum
and to inform the development of interventions that promote equitable care for LEP patients. In Aim 1, we will
survey a national sample of physicians to examine variation in medical care delivery to LEP patients with thyroid
nodules and thyroid cancer. In Aim 2, we will recruit patients from two sites, the University of Michigan (U-M)
and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), to conduct virtual focus groups of LEP and English-
proficient Chinese patients with thyroid nodules to explore their experiences with thyroid nodule evaluation and
treatment. In Aim 3, we will use study findings from Aims 1 and 2 to inform the development and evaluation of a
thyroid nodule decision preparation tool prototype for LEP Chinese patients. Data from the subsequent pilot
clinical trial to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of this intervention will inform
a R01 application to develop and evaluate a more comprehensive, multilevel, personalized thyroid nodule
decision preparation tool that is accessible in multiple languages. By tailoring this intervention to the LEP patient
population and targeting disparities more upstream of the cancer continuum, we hope to improve downstream
cancer outcomes for LEP patients with thyroid cancer. This innovative research proposal fulfills a critically
important unmet public health need while serving as a vehicle for Dr. Debbie Chen’s development into an
independent health services researcher in the fields of cancer disparities and thyroidology. In addition to didactic
learning, she will receive mentoring from her team of committed mentors and advisors who have complementary
expertise and are internationally recognized experts in their field. Upon completion of this carefully designed
project linking skill acquisition to research aims, Dr. Chen will emerge as an expert in linguistic disparities across
the cancer care continuum."

It is our long-term goal to understand computations that underlie sensori-motor transformations in the context
of thermoregulatory behaviors. Generating appropriate behaviors in response to sensory stimuli is critical for
the survival of any animal. Larval zebrafish will be used for these studies as it is the only vertebrate model
which allows comprehensive identification and manipulation of thermoregulatory circuits. Importantly, larval
zebrafish is an ectotherm animal and therefore exclusively relies on thermal gradient navigation for
thermoregulation. This means that the underlying sensori-motor transformations are robust since accurate
thermoregulation is critical for survival.
The accessibility of the zebrafish nervous system to optical recording of neural activity enabled us to map
thermoregulatory circuits from sensory input to behavioral output for the first time in any animal. This research
identified two critical classes of hindbrain neurons which encode the rate of heating and the rate of cooling in
the environment. Notably, these heating and cooling responses are computed de-novo in the hindbrain from
sensory trigeminal inputs. The aim of this proposal is to uncover the biophysical mechanism of these
computations and their role in behavior generation to generate a multiscale model of sensori-motor
transformations. The proposed experiments are guided by testable hypotheses about hindbrain computation
that are based on our previous circuit modeling efforts. Specifically, the research will investigate the (1) cellular
mechanisms of computing heating and cooling responses, (2) how the circuit anatomy supports this
computation and (3) how the responses of Heating and Cooling neurons influence turning during
thermoregulatory behavior. To this end experiments will combine (1) patch electrophysiology in functionally
identified neurons, (2) single cell labeling through electroporations and (3) cell type specific ablations followed
by behavioral recordings.
This research will fill a critical gap in our understanding of sensori-motor transformations: How computations at
different scales, from cellular properties to circuits, interact to generate adaptive behaviors in response to
sensory stimuli. The understanding of conserved and divergent principles of sensori-motor transformations
across animals and sensory modalities furthermore promises insight into what goes awry in neurological
disease states where sensory processing goes awry."

Addressing a paucity of training in multilingual research methods, we propose a unique, short-term education
program to provide child health researchers with the sensitivity, skills, and knowledge to recruit and engage
Limited English Proficiency (LEP) children and families in research. In the US there are approximately 7.8
million children and adolescents with no English-proficient parents. These children and youth are
disproportionately excluded from child health research because of language barriers, and this threatens both
the validity and the generalizability of research findings. It also raises difficult questions regarding adherence to
the ethical principle of justice and the Civil Rights Act. And because Latino and Asian children are
disproportionately affected by language barriers, lack of preparation to conduct multilingual research is also a
barrier to adherence to the NIH policy regarding the inclusion of minorities as subjects in clinical research.
To address this gap, we propose a training program with three components: First, we will offer a 3-day virtual
workshop including hands-on training sessions with expert medical interpreters; orientation to an
anthropological understanding of language and communication; practice in the development of multilingual
enrollment and study instruments; and attention to team-building and budgeting for language resources.
Second, we will deliver monthly webinars to address specific, practical issues that arise in the experience of
trainees following the short course, e.g., writing for peer review. Third, we will create opportunities for
participants to convene, network, and engage in professional development—e.g., by collaborating on
conference workshop submissions and holding monthly, virtual works-in-progress—to build an intellectual
community for multilingual child health research. These activities will be led by seasoned researchers,
educators, and professional interpreters from Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania,
and Pennsylvania State University, in collaboration with senior researchers from the project’s Invited Faculty
and Advisory Committee. The short course will be appropriate for graduate, postdoctoral, and other child
health investigators, including early and mid-career faculty, with prior research methods/design training and
who are seeking specialized training in multilingual methods.
By training and supporting a cohort of investigators, we hope to help transform the practice of child health
research by making inclusion of LEP children and families the norm rather than the exception. We also hope to
support the career development of multilingual investigators from underrepresented backgrounds by providing
them with the training and tools to leverage their language skills for rigorous and reproducible research and
grant-seeking. Ultimately, we believe this short course will enhance the equity, quality, and impact of child
health research, leading to better health outcomes for children in the US and around the world."

 The decreased quality of life and increased morbidity due to oncological drugs such as Tyrosine Kinase
Inhibitors (TKIs) is a serious and growing general health problem. In particular, cardiovascular (CV) morbidities
are a major detrimental factor affecting the survivorship of cancer patients. The primary roadblock to addressing
the toxicity of TKIs is that they inhibit multiple kinases besides those necessary to achieve the anti-cancer effect,
but the kinases responsible for CV toxicity are poorly defined. This K99/R00 project supports a productive
physician-scientist to identify kinase interaction networks relevant to the anti-cancer and CV toxic effects of TKIs.
 Preliminary data builds on the candidate’s research leading to the development of analogues of the TKI
ponatinib that have greatly reduced toxicity, which can additionally be used as probes of signaling in CV and
tumor cells. These studies identified candidate kinases that, when inhibited, are detrimental to cardiomyocyte
and endothelial cells, as well as candidate kinases that, when inhibited, elicit potentially protective effects against
CV morbidities. By using pharmacological and genetic probes, the broad objectives of the project are 1)
determine the comprehensive kinase signaling networks responsible for anti-cancer activity in Chronic Myeloid
Leukemia (CML) and the kinases that evoke the CV toxicity in each of the two major CV lineages
(cardiomyocytes and vascular endothelial cell) and 2) verify and characterize kinases that, when inhibited,
prevent this toxicity. The mentored (K99) phase of the project will focus on elucidating the kinase networks
responsible for the anti-cancer effect in CML carrying the drug resistant mutation T315I (K99-Aim1) and for CV
toxicity (K99-Aim 1). The independent (R00) phase of the project will examine candidate protective kinases
networks (involving inhibition of ROCK1, RAF1 and MAPK11) using xenograft models of CML-T315I treated with
ponatinib (R00-Aim1A) and non-small cells lung cancer treated with osimertinib (R00-Aim1B).
 The proposed research and training plan will prepare the applicant to successfully transition to a productive
independent academic career defining mechanisms relevant to the safety and efficacy of oncology drugs. The
mentoring plan describes roles of the primary mentor, an Advisory Committee consisting of highly regarded
senior PIs at multiple institutions who are experts in clinical and basic science aspects of oncology, drug
development and cardio-oncology, and collaborators who are leaders in kinase network mapping, and
bioinformatics. The training plan will expand the applicant’s skills in cutting edge technologies such as kinase
mapping approaches, mass spectrometry and computational analysis of the high-throughput data, and
leadership skills. The training will be a critical factor for R00 independent phase and beyond. Training will take
place at Stanford University enabling her to become an independent academic PI and leader in the development
of safer and more effective oncology drugs to improve survivorship and life-quality of cancer patients."

 Laryngotracheal Stenosis (LTS) is the pathologic narrowing of the larynx, subglottis, and trachea
secondary to mucosal injury from prolonged intubation. This narrowing leads to dyspnea, dysphonia, and can
rapidly progress to airway compromise. Therapeutic interventions for the management of LTS are limited to
serial dilation, tracheal resection, or permanent tracheostomy which further impairs communication. Medical
therapies for LTS are limited by our poor understanding of LTS pathogenesis. Improved understanding of the
mechanisms promoting LTS is needed to improve treatment of this debilitating disease.
 Previous investigation has revealed that an intact immune response is critical to the development of LTS.
Characterization of the immune response in LTS has demonstrated increased populations of CD4+ T-cells and
macrophages. Preliminary studies in a murine LTS model reveal that depletion of the macrophage population
attenuates LTS fibrosis, implicating their pathologic role. However, the local immune mediators and cell signaling
pathways promoting pathologic macrophages in LTS are unknown.
 Macrophage activation is regulated through stimulation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLRs are highly
conserved receptors recognizing Pathogen or Damage Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs/DAMPs) and
lead to downstream activation of regulatory proteins controlling phenotype. Using single cell RNA sequencing
the PI has demonstrates increased expression of the TLR4-MyD88 signaling pathway in LTS macrophages.
Furthermore, we have identified increased expression of the DAMP S100A8/A9 in LTS tissue. S100A8/A9 is a
known activator of TLR4-MyD88 signaling, and worsens fibrosis in our murine LTS model. These findings
indicate that TLR4-MyD88 signaling pathways in macrophages may be critical to LTS pathogenesis. However,
the relationship between S100A8/A9, TLR4-MyD88 signaling, and pathologic macrophages has not been
explored in LTS or other fibrotic diseases, and may represent a critical signaling axis driving pathologic fibrosis.
 For this study, we will elucidate the signaling networks promoting pathologic macrophages in laryngotracheal
stenosis. In Aim 1 we will assess effect of S100A8/A9 on macrophage phenotype and function in a murine LTS
model, establish that S100A8/A9s profibrotic effect is mediated by macrophages, and identify the key sources
of pathologic S100A8/A9 in human LTS and a murine model. In Aim 2, we will demonstrate the critical role of
TLR4-MyD88 signaling in promoting pathologic macrophages in LTS, and elucidate the role of IL1β in promoting
LTS fibrosis. Finally, in Aim 3 we will assess S100A8/A9 as a candidate biomarker for the development of
laryngotracheal stenosis in patients who have had prolonged intubation. Collectively, this application will lead to
an in-depth understanding of the cell signaling networks promoting dysregulated macrophage mediated
inflammation and subsequent fibrosis in LTS. The identification of key regulatory pathways promoting pathologic
macrophages in LTS will serve as the foundation for targeted treatment strategies that attenuate fibrosis."

 The World Health Organization estimates that 1 in 6 adults over the age of 60 has been a
victim of abuse in the past year. Our research demonstrated that nearly one-third of these
victims have clinically significant depressive symptoms and 16% have suicidal ideation (Sirey et
al., 2015). Tele-PROTECT, is the only manualized, virtual therapy for elder abuse victims
experiencing depression. It is offered to victims at the same time that they are receiving services
from elder abuse agencies that offer safety planning, support services, and legal services. Tele-
PROTECT was designed using a deployment-focused approach with our partners at the New
York City Department for the Aging (DFTA). Tele-PROTECT strategies focus on increasing
pleasurable and rewarding activities to reduce depression, and goal setting and defining the
action steps to increase safety related empowerment. In our randomized controlled pilot project,
participants receiving PROTECT had significant decreases in symptoms of depression as
compared to those in the referral control condition (Sirey et al., 2021). Our preliminary work
during the pandemic, demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of virtual delivery of
PROTECT via video (called Tele-PROTECT) to a large sample of diverse victims.
 This project will test the effectiveness of Tele-PROTECT as compared to a video-delivered
attention control condition (DepEd). We will recruit 140 English- and Spanish-speaking elder
abuse victims from five New York City (NYC) elder abuse agencies. We hypothesize that Tele-
PROTECT participants will experience greater decreases in depressive symptoms and greater
increase in safety-related empowerment compared to an attention control (DepEd).
 Elder abuse agency staff will refer depressed victims who agree to research staff. Eligible
elder abuse victims who consent, have a baseline assessment and meet inclusion criteria will
be randomized to Tele-PROTECT or DepEd. Follow up assessments will be conducted at
weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12 after baseline. Trained Research Assistants blinded to study hypotheses
will assess depression severity (MADRS) and safety-related empowerment (MOVERS), as well
as participation in activities, social isolation, and criminal justice outcomes. In collaboration with
a national organization of elder abuse agencies (NAPSA), we will use a mixed methods design
with multiple stakeholder groups to collect data on the barriers and facilitators to the
implementation of Tele-PROTECT nationally. Tele-PROTECT has demonstrated feasibility,
acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness. This project will test a scalable manualized therapy
with the potential for national implementation to serve depressed victims of elder abuse."

As Kamala Harris proclaimed in June 2022 when she launched the White House Action Plan on Water
Security, the global water crisis is among the most urgent issues of our time. Water insecurity, or the lack of
stable access to safe and acceptable water, has been identified as a threat to human well-being that is
plausibly on par with that of food insecurity. Further, emerging evidence suggests that the impacts of water
insecurity are surprisingly far-reaching, including suboptimal nutrition, physical health, and mental health. We
are, however, early on in our understanding of the role of water insecurity in human health, in part because we
have lacked precise measures of water insecurity. Therefore, the core scientific objective of this R03
application is to understand the roles of water and food insecurity experiences on key health outcomes
among a nationally representative sample of Mexican adults from Mexico's 2021 National Health and Nutrition
Survey [Encuesta Nacional de Salud y Nutrición (ENSANUT)]. Our central hypothesis is that water insecurity
will be negatively associated with health measures, even when controlling for known key covariates. In Aim 1,
we will investigate the associations between water insecurity and indicators of nutrition (intake of sugar-
sweetened beverages, ultra-processed foods, fruits, vegetables), physical health (adiposity, blood pressure,
diabetes), and mental health (depressive symptomatology). In Aim 2, we will examine if concurrent water and
food insecurity have a synergistic (multiplicative) relationship with health measures, i.e., if those experiencing
both insecurities have worse health than expected from the additive associations with water and food
insecurity. Increasing our knowledge about how water insecurity shapes health is highly significant because
global problems with water quantity (both flooding & shortages) and quality are occurring with increasing
frequency and severity due to climate change, population growth, and crumbling infrastructure. This project is
innovative for its precise measurement of water insecurity. Before 2019, global indicators of water captured
only the physical availability of water or water infrastructure; these are far more distal predictors of human
health. It is also innovative because ENSANUT 2021 is the first national health and nutrition survey in which
experiences of water insecurity have been measured. Finally, the concurrent measurement of water and food
insecurity will bring unprecedented insights into their potential synergisms in North America. Expected
outcomes include a clearer picture of the epidemiology of water insecurity in Mexico and a more precise
understanding of how experiences with problematic water access, use, and stability can act as barriers to
optimal health. This information will likely reveal novel ways to intervene to reduce resource inequities and the
risk of poor health outcomes among vulnerable populations. This work will also set the precedent for inclusion
of experiential measures of water insecurity in other large nutrition and health surveys in low-, middle-, and
high-income countries, including the US."
10894317,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Ten Eleven Translocation (TET1, TET2 and TET3) are α-ketoglutarate (αKG) and Fe2+ dependent DNA-
dioxygenases that is a key regulator of epigenetic landscape. These enzymes progressively oxidize 5-
methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and further to 5-formylcytosine and 5-carboxylcytosine in DNA
culminating into DNA demethylation essential for efficient transcription over large time scales. Loss-of-function
TET2 mutations (TET2MT), is one of the most frequent pathogenic lesion in MDS and related hematologic
malignancies in humans. TET2MT are found in all disease stages and levels of aggressiveness. In addition, recent
studies have demonstrated that somatic TET2MT are very frequently found in “healthy” elderly. The presence of
TET2MT in CHIP implies that it is an early event in the creation of hematologic disorders. It also supports murine
study conclusions that TET2MT cause expansions of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC). Early
events in the evolution of defective clones are rational targets for preventative strategies since clones in such
stages are likely to be dependent on these events. Their presence in all cells can, however, also be exploited in
late stages of the disease. For example, the combined loss of TET1 and TE2 in hematopoietic cells in murine
models extends life substantially relative to TET2 loss alone. In addition, the proof of principle is also derived
from observation in patients with IDH1/2MT whereby, these neomorphic mutations lead to the production of a
weak TET inhibitor, 2-hydroxyglutyrate (2-HG), known inhibitor of dioxygenases. Our observations that IDH1/2MT
are mutually exclusive with TET2MT, strongly supports our hypotheses that the TET inhibitor, 2-HG, prevents
evolution of TET2MT clones. This observation was further substantiated in a cellular model of myeloid malignant
cells and supports that synthetic lethality can be achieved through elimination of remaining TET-activity essential
for efficient transcription for proliferation in TET-dioxygenase deficient TET2MT clones.
Our overarching hypothesis is that rationally designed and synthesized small molecules TETi76 can be utilized
to impede compensatory TET dioxygenase activity originating from TET3 and TET1, to cause either synthetic
lethality or lineage redirection in cases with TET2MT inactivation. Our goal is to develop a novel therapeutic
approach for TET2MT MDS by evaluating the potential use of TETi76 as targeted treatments in preclinical models.
More specifically, we aim to: i) Study the mechanistic consequences of TET inhibition in normal and malignant
hematopoiesis in vitro. ii) Establish the effects of TETi compounds in vitro using human and murine cellular
models and iii) Characterize TETi preventative and therapeutic efficacy as well as tolerability in pre-clinical
murine models.
Our proposal, if successful, will lead to a novel class of therapeutic agents for TET2MT associated hematopoietic
disorders, and perhaps also other dioxygenase mutations. This work could also have implications for cancers
mutated in histone demethylase KDM6A, which is similar to TET2 and frequently mutated in bladder cancer."
10828440,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Methylglyoxal (MG) is a potent intracellular glycating agent that forms advanced glycation endproducts. Formed
spontaneously from 3-carbon glycolytic intermediates, MG rapidly glycates proteins and nucleotides, damages
mitochondria and directly increases reactive oxygen species production; thus inducing a pro-oxidant state and
senescent-like condition. MG and the related glyoxalase enzymatic defense system are emerging as critical
players in aging and age-related disease processes. Under physiologic conditions MG is rapidly detoxified by
glyoxalase 1 (GLO1). However, when GLO1 is attenuated, MG flux is increased and MG-modified proteins
accumulate (termed dicarbonyl stress), both within and outside the cell. Dicarbonyl stress promotes glucose
intolerance, oxidative stress and inflammation. The mechanisms regulating GLO1 protein stability and enzymatic
activity in skeletal muscle tissue, a tissue critical to glucose metabolism, are not well studied and there is a critical
need to understand the functional consequences of reduced GLO1 in the context of obesity, aging and age-
related disease. GLO1 is critical to cellular function and subject to numerous posttranslational modifications
(PTMs) that regulate GLO1 protein stability and activity. Our objective is to establish robust translational models
to delineate the mechanisms by which GLO1 is regulated to better understand the functional consequences of
attenuated GLO1. The generation of new, state-of-the-art translational models will help to accelerate the
understanding of GLO1 attenuation and dicarbonyl stress and the implications for skeletal muscle health across
both the life-span and health-span. We aim to establish the functional relevance of both GLO1 loss and the
impact of PTMs of GLO1 in human myotubes. Our approach is to attenuate GLO1 and mutate critical amino acid
residues using CRISPR gene editing technology, coupled with measures of dicarbonyl stress. We expect to
identify a novel, muscle specific mechanism of GLO1 dysregulation and methylglyoxal-mediated damage. The
successful completion of this work will have an important positive impact on advancing the understanding, and
provide potential therapeutic targets, to maintain skeletal muscle function with aging and age-related disease."

Despite being one of the fastest-growing immigrant populations in the United States, older Chinese Americans
remain understudied in health research. The penetration of the model minority stereotype has caused the
overlook of significant disadvantages and health burdens experienced by older Chinese Americans, particularly
foreign-born older Chinese Americans. The double disadvantage of being a member of an ethnic minority and
foreign-born puts foreign-born older Chinese Americans at high risk of experiencing psychosocial stressors,
including anti-Asian racism and social isolation. These psychosocial stressors are key risk factors for poor
physical health, including poor cardiometabolic health. Indeed, existing studies have shown a fast decline in
cardiometabolic health after immigrating to the United States among older Chinese immigrants. However, there
is a lack of a fine-grained characterization of psychosocial stressors and the processes through which these
psychosocial stressors affect cardiometabolic health in older Chinese immigrants. Existing studies on this topic
were largely focused on non-Hispanic Whites or other ethnic minorities. To address this gap, we aim to adopt a
mixed-methods approach, along with the ecological momentary assessment, to identify the key psychosocial
stressors related to cardiometabolic health in a sample of 80 older Chinese immigrants. Specifically, our
proposed aims are: Aim 1a: Investigate the intermediate role of daily emotion (negative and positive emotion)
and salivary cortisol (a biological marker of stress) through which psychosocial stressors (e.g., racial
discrimination) affect systemic inflammation (CRP, IL-6) and metabolic syndrome; Aim 1b: Explore whether key
sociocultural factors (living in ethnic enclaves, English proficiency, socioeconomic status) will attenuate the
associations examined in Aim 1a; and Aim 2: Identify additional cultural, environmental, family, and individual
factors that further explain the association between psychosocial stress and cardiometabolic health through
semi-structured interviews in a subsample of 16 participants from Aim 1. Findings from this proposed study will
contribute to our understanding of key psychosocial stressors and related biopsychological processes
contributing to poor cardiometabolic health in older Chinese immigrants. As a result, this project will guide the
design of future culturally-tailored, time-sensitive, personalized psychosocial interventions that aim to reduce
racial disparities in cardiometabolic health and promote healthy equity in older Chinese Americans."
10849761,"Project Summary/Abstract: Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is a leading cause of death after
severe trauma, which is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. MODS is thought to be a consequence of a
vicious cascade of excessive inflammation and coagulation abnormalities but remains incompletely
understood. Recent advances in the resuscitation of trauma patients (such as whole blood transfusion and the
use of tranexamic acid) have led to improved initial survival, yet these critically ill patients now stay alive to be
at risk to develop MODS and other immune/inflammatory complications. This makes understanding how
MODS occurs a critical and an immediate need in trauma. MODS is thought to arise in the setting of excessive
innate immune activation and is associated with the late phase of trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC). TIC is
characterized by endothelial injury, excessive thrombosis manifesting as both severe small vessel thrombosis,
which contributes to organ dysfunction, as well as deadly large vessel thromboembolic events. There is a
critical need to identify a mechanistic link between the excessive inflammatory and innate immune responses
and the defects in coagulation in order to understand MODS.
 The overarching goal of our research is to understand how trauma leads to organ injury through
inflammation and clotting of blood vessels, or immunothrombosis. Our research focus is the central role of
platelet function in driving immunothrombosis after trauma. Our preliminary data demonstrate that platelets are
critical to the innate immune response after injury. Platelets are sentinel cells in immune function and serve a
critical regulatory function by interacting with other inflammatory cells, and in this way are a major link between
inflammation and thrombosis. Furthermore, trauma-induced `dysfunctional' platelets are key components to
both drive TIC and to amplify inflammation and organ injury. Thus, we hypothesize that dysfunctional platelets
and their interactions with other immune cells are critical regulators of MODS. There is an imminent need to
develop research focusing on the prevention and management of organ injury and complications of
inflammation/thrombosis, and this represents the key theme of the present proposal and research program.
Furthermore, modern trauma resuscitation is rapidly changing to include new techniques which saves lives
after injury. We must understand exactly how these interventions work to design the next great advance in
resuscitation and also how they impact the risk of MODS. Essential to this is the need to develop targeted
therapeutic strategies to treat the overwhelming morbidity after trauma.
 We propose to tackle the following key knowledge gaps in the field:
1) Understand the cellular mechanisms leading to micro-thrombotic organ injury in survivors after trauma
2) Unravel the immune and inflammatory consequences of modern trauma resuscitation
3) Design targeted interventions for post-traumatic organ injury and thrombosis"

The purpose of this timely and significant K01 is to provide the PI (Dr. Bunting) with the training and expertise
necessary to become an independent investigator of substance use research, specializing in the development
of interventions that improve health outcomes of vulnerable populations with a specific focus on polysubstance
use involving opioids. Despite the prevalence of polysubstance use and its association with high-risk outcomes
such as overdose, significant gaps in our understanding persist in part due to limitations of existing substance
use screening and assessment tools. The ability to accurately measure polysubstance use among high-risk
populations is a critical step towards developing effective strategies for improving substance-related health
outcomes of this population. The overall goal of the proposal is the development of a novel polysubstance
assessment tool and identification of correlates and motivations of polysubstance use behaviors among high-
risk vulnerable populations. The long-term goal of this line of investigation is to develop interventions targeted
to polysubstance use behaviors in vulnerable populations as an independent investigator of substance use
research. To achieve this goal, the proposed award has been designed to augment the PI’s existing training in
sociology and health services through a comprehensive plan that will enable her to: (1) obtain methodological
skills specific to instrument development and validation, (2) enhance her ability to conduct independent
research including the recruitment and retention of vulnerable populations and remote study management, and
(3) develop focused skills in health services intervention development specific to vulnerable populations (i.e.,
persons who use substances, justice-involved). These skills will be developed at the high-impact training
environment of the New York University Grossman School of Medicine with a collaborative mentoring team of
nationally renowned experts. The training plan is strategically complemented by a rigorous mixed-method
study. Building on prior training while expanding to new skills, the independent line of research aims to: (1)
develop and test the psychometric properties of a novel assessment tool to measure polysubstance use for
high-risk vulnerable populations, (2) examine the predictive validity of the novel polysubstance use assessment
tool by examining risk behaviors over a 6-month period in a high-risk vulnerable population, and (3) acquire
preliminary data regarding the development and acceptability of intervention strategies for polysubstance use
populations. By the conclusion of this award, the PI will be positioned as a rising leader in polysubstance use
research and positioned to excel in a career of polysubstance use interventions through future R-mechanism
funding opportunities."

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder where individuals exhibit deficits in
cognitive flexibility. Purpose: This proposal will record from the frontal cortex of Fmr1 KOs (model of Fragile X
syndrome) during cognitive flexibility tasks and assess how neural hyperexcitability within the KOs impacts
reversal learning and shifts of attention. Methods: Fmr1 KOs and wildtype rats will be trained on categorical
perception tasks with touchscreens in operant chambers. Single-unit neurophysiology and local field potentials
will be collected from the frontal cortex (including the anterior cingulate) during the tasks. It is important to
understand how altered neural function within the KOs impacts cognitive function and learning. This project will
compare neural activity from putative pyramidal and interneurons to examine differential functions during
cognition. Examining these differences in neural function between KOs and WT will enhance our
understanding of how cortical excitability impacts cognition. The local field potentials can provide templates of
neural signatures that in future studies can be compared to electroencephalography data from humans with
ASD or Fragile X."

 The goal of this project is to explore the feasibility of generating Chimeric Antigen Receptors (CARs)
expressed by bacteria. Instead of using T cells, we propose to explore the idea and use of bacteria to mediate
the targeted destruction of cancer cells. In addition, we explore the possibility that we could target CAR-bacteria
to specific major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-neopeptide complexes (pMHC) on tumor cells. We call these
engineered bacteria cells CAR-bacteria. Current CAR-expressing T cells provide durable responses but have
three main limitations: specificity, toxicity, and feasibility. This study will address all three concerns. In this
proposal, we target engineered bacterial lysis to head and neck or cervical cancer cells expressing HLA-A2-E7,
a known pMHC on tumor cells infected by human papilloma virus (HPV). The targeting enables anti-tumor protein
production only when a predefined population density of bacteria is reached. This method should dramatically
reduce bacterial colony size and greatly lowers/prevents systemic toxicities. The approach has the potential to
be a therapeutic in HPV-positive oral cancer as it could be administered and controlled as a bacterial mouthwash.
This project combines two innovations leveraging a Synthetically-Evolved Nanobody (SEN) library proven
capable of selectively binding MHC-peptide complexes and combining this specific cancer cell targeting with
synchronized circuit lysis to create CAR-bacteria. Our proposed studies provide proof-of-concept that (1) CARs
can be produced that recognize pMHC, (2) CAR-bacteria localization and colonization can be controlled by tumor
expression of certain pMHC and (3) CAR-bacteria have therapeutic activity against tumor cells that express
specific pMHC. We accomplish these proof-of-concept studies via the following two objectives: (1) Optimize
binding and specificity of CAR-bacteria to HLA-A2-E7 and (2) Check efficacy of CAR-bacteria in an animal model
of head and neck and cervical cancer."

A core symptom observed in anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is increased fear
generalization, as defined by the overgeneralization of fear from a conditioned, fear-inducing stimulus to
neutral stimuli. Fear generalization can lead to maladaptive responses in a safe environment. Our laboratory
uses a behavioral assay called contextual fear discrimination (CFD) to assess fear generalization in mice. We
shock a mouse in one context (context A), and then we can measure whether they can discriminate between
this aversive, shock-paired context and a similar, but safe context (context B) over approximately 10 days of
discrimination learning. In our recent publications, we show that 1) adolescent male, but not adolescent female
mice overgeneralize fear; 2) adult female, but not adult male mice overgeneralize fear; and 3) aged mice of
both sexes overgeneralize fear and cannot discriminate between two contexts. Therefore, there is clearly an
age- and sex-dependent influence on fear overgeneralization. However, the neural ensembles mediating fear
generalization across the lifespan have yet to be identified. In this grant proposal, we will use this CFD
paradigm, in combination with an activity-dependent tagging genetic mouse line to identify and
pharmacologically manipulate the neural ensembles mediating fear generalization.
 In Aim 1, we will identify and quantify the neural ensembles mediating fear generalization in adolescent
and adult mice by utilizing the ArcCreERT2 x EYFP mice. This mouse line allows for the indelible labeling of
cells expressing the immediate early gene (IEG) Arc/Arg3.1 and allows for a comparison between the cells that
are activated during the encoding of a memory and those that are activated during the retrieval of the
corresponding memory, with the overlap between the two populations being defined as an engram or memory
trace. Therefore, using our activity-dependent tagging mouse line, we can determine where and how sex and
age impact fear generalization neural ensembles throughout the brain.
 In Aim 2, we will pharmacologically manipulate adolescent and adult mice with the goal of improving
behavioral fear overgeneralization and the corresponding neural circuits. In the last two decades, (R,S)-
ketamine has emerged as a rapid-acting antidepressant. Interestingly, we have reported that (R,S)-ketamine
decreases fear generalization. Here, male and female adolescent and adult mice will be administered a single
dose of saline or (R,S)-ketamine. CFD and ex vivo whole-brain imaging will be used in order to identify the
underlying neural ensembles. The outcome of this study will provide direct evidence that altered neural
ensembles result in fear overgeneralization, and that (R,S)-ketamine has the potential to decrease fear
overgeneralization, a core system of anxiety disorders and PTSD."

This proposal outlines a plan to characterize the early steps of HIV-1 capsid assembly using a novel and
recently available single molecule technique. The earliest steps include association of myristoylated Gag (myr-
Gag) with the plasma membrane, oligomerization of Gag, and recruitment of dimeric viral genomic RNA. There
is a large literature on the early steps, but the in vitro biochemical data has primarily focused on studies
involving two of the three required components: protein, RNA, and lipid. Here, we propose to use mass
photometry (MP) to study Gag-Gag and Gag-RNA interactions in a model lipid membrane system, namely
supported lipid bilayers (SLBs). Mass photometry is a relatively new method to characterize the distribution of
molecular weights (MW) in a sample using interferometry of scattered light. Data can be recorded either as a
“landing assay” observing molecules adsorbing to a surface non-specifically, or as a “dynamic assay”,
observing molecules diffusing on an SLB. In the landing assay, the distribution of MW for molecules
associating/dissociating from the surface is measured, providing information on the distribution of oligomeric
states and complexes. In the dynamic assay, both the position and MW of the complexes are recorded as a
function of time. The latter assay provides an unprecedented opportunity to observe Gag and Gag:RNA
complexes in an SLB in a label-free manner."

Amblyopia is a disorder of spatial vision despite good retinal image quality and eye health. It affects 2-3% of
the population and almost always develops with early misalignment (strabismus) or unequal refractive power
(anisometropia), or form deprivation (cataract). Most studies on human amblyopia concentrate on thresholds
for contrast, size or offset, but striking perceptual distortions have been documented by asking amblyopes to
describe or draw clearly visible high-contrast letters, rings, and sinusoidal gratings. Form distortions are likely
to be at least as big a problem as loss of visual resolution for daily life. Forms are defined by local orientations,
and almost all neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) are tuned for orientation, highlighting its importance in
parsing visual images. The replicable systematic perceptual distortions of gratings drawn by amblyopes are
unexplainable with a neural scrambling model or a systematic shift in the neural map, but are compatible with
errors in the neural encoding of orientation in V1, while also involving decoding mechanisms in later cortical
areas. Our team of researchers and clinicians proposes to examine the neural development and functional
implications of the grating distortions by using our recent psychophysics, electrophysiology and modeling
results in the domains of ON/OFF system imbalance in amblyopia, cortical map formation, orientation
processing across V1, and the processing of parallel orientation signals for perceptions of 3-D shape, object
pose and mirror symmetry. We aim to model the neural development of errors in orientation encoding as a
consequence of ON-OFF imbalance caused by anisometropia and strabismus, which limits the orientation
tuning and spatial resolution of V1 neurons and shrinks the ocular dominance columns for the amblyopic eye.
We will also examine if orientation processing errors in the amblyopic eye make it difficult to do higher level
tasks that rely on orientation cues, or if there is some compensatory mechanism, and if the fellow eye performs
normally, overcompensates, or is handicapped because the lack of stereo makes it difficult to calibrate
monocular cues during development. Psychophysical and electrophysiological data suggest that amblyopia
also involves abnormalities in cortical areas after V1, suggesting that physiological changes may be
propagated and amplified in higher cortical areas that may have prolonged windows of plasticity. In addition,
regions of V1 that are unresponsive during passive viewing of visual stimuli in macular degeneration, can be
activated by engaging the subjects in a stimulus-related task, suggesting a role for top-down influences on
plasticity. The stimuli we use to identify deficits in functionally important visual tasks could be used to trigger
top-down signals from higher brain areas as part of the design of future treatments for recovery of perceptual
performance in adulthood, which would supplement treatments for improving visual acuity and binocularity.
Possibly the biggest payoff could come from directly testing if top-down signals from these tasks reactivate
plasticity in orientation selective V1 neurons in adult amblyopes."
10848451,"MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP) is an inherited colorectal cancer (CRC) syndrome that results from
inherited biallelic mutations in the gene for the MUTYH base excision repair (BER) glycosylase. Our laboratory
provided enzymatic analysis on the functional defects of two missense variants of MUTYH found in colorectal
cancer that was key for establishing the connection between MUTYH variants and colorectal cancer. MUTYH
prevents mutations associated with 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2’-deoxyguanosine (OG) by removal of misincorporated
adenine residues from OG:A mismatches, and thus aberrantly functioning MUTYH leads to the accumulation of
mutations in tumor suppressor genes. Since the original discovery of MAP over 300 different mutations have
been reported in MUTYH. This project is focused on revealing fundamental features of MUTYH and MUTYH
variants. Our underlying hypothesis is that a detailed molecular understanding of OG:A mismatch recognition
goes hand-in-hand with revealing intricacies of the relationship between MUTYH and cancer. By corrrelating
results from enzymatic assays with cellular assays in E. coli and mammalian cells we have uncovered the
impact of specific molecular defects in damage recognition and base excision on overall MUTYH-mediated
repair. This has led to uncovering many new surprising features of MUTYH-mediated repair that will be the
focus of this renewal grant application. Specifically, we will use a multi-faceted approach involving nucleic acid
chemistry, enzymology, single-molecule experiments and cellular assays to analyze a large number of MUTYH
variants localized near the two metal cofactors and FSH OG recognition motif to reveal insight into critical
features impacting damage recognition and repair. We also will evaluate the impact of MUTYH variants in the
context of chromatin. We will also evaluate how damage recognition by MUTYH in chromatin may be
facilitated by the damage sensor UV-DDB. We recently showed that MUTYH binding to abasic sites in DNA
mediates a cytotoxic response to alkylation damage. We will determine if the interaction of MUTYH with
abasic sites is the underlying origin of the growing implication of MUTYH involvement in the response to DNA
damage beyond OG:A mispairs, such as UV light and chemotherapeutic DNA damaging agents. The
significance of this work is that it will provide important information into the mechanisms by which MUTYH
dysfunction, either inherited or acquired, sets the stage for carcinogenesis and this information will directly
influence appropriate patient management. In addition, the role of MUTYH and MUTYH variants in mediating
celllular responses to oxidative damage, alkylation and UV light may provide the basis for innovative new
therapeutic approaches."

Disparities persist in STEM fields for underrepresented minority and economically disadvantaged students
despite the emergence of many formal and informal interventions. STEM identity – one’s view of themself as a
scientist or engineer – plays a crucial role in students’ motivations to pursue STEM education and careers.
Identity is particularly important for minorities and girls in middle school (Grades 6 – 8). Providing middle
school students with project-based experiences that challenge them to employ STEM thinking and practices
are essential in STEM identity development. The burden for creating these opportunities falls largely on
teachers, who often feel ill-equipped to impart these concepts, especially in teaching engineering and
engineering design, areas of emphasis in the widely-adopted Next Generation Science Standards. This is
unfortunate because engineering design is an exciting entry point for STEM that involves inquiry, project-based
learning, and the application of technical skills and knowledge to real-world problems.
 The Hk Maker Lab has provided engineering design-centric education to hundreds of high school students
throughout New York City and has prepared teachers to teach engineering design and incorporate design
thinking into their practice. We are now ready to extend our efforts to middle school students and teachers to
further propel underrepresented minority students towards STEM opportunities at a crucial juncture in their
educational journeys. The Specific Aims of the proposed program are to:
I. Provide early engineering education opportunities to middle school students via Design Hackathons
 that will take place throughout the academic year in addition to continuing the annual Hk Maker Lab
 Summer Design Camp for high school students.
II. Expand the Hk Maker Lab teacher training to middle school teachers to develop their engineering
 design knowledge and self-efficacy such that they can integrate design into their instruction.
III. Cultivate a cohort of master ‘Teachineers’ who are highly adept in engineering design thinking and
 instruction, and can teach design thinking to other teachers via professional development workshops.
The Hk Maker Lab will give both teachers and students hands-on design experiences. The student participants
will have the opportunity to engineer solutions to problems. Working with middle school students will create a
positive STEM trajectory that will result in increased diversity in the field. The participating teachers will receive
an innovative training experience, which they can subsequently use to integrate engineering design into their
school curricula. Finally, by empowering teachers to teach their colleagues, we will be able to scale these
efforts to a wider range of students and teachers, increasing the impact of our engineering design training and
supporting the creation of a diverse STEM education and professional community."

My application for a Pathway to Independence Award represents the ideal next step toward reaching my goal of
becoming a leading independent investigator focused on the development and evaluation of systems-based
approaches for effectively delivering CIH interventions for common chronic conditions. The current application
proposes the development and pragmatic pilot testing of a novel CIH-based stepped care approach for co-
occurring chronic pain and PTSD. The aims of the proposal strategically align with my specific career
development goals of gaining expertise in 1) systems-based care models for complex co-occurring physical and
mental health conditions, 2) pragmatic clinical trial design for CIH interventions, and 3) user-centered design
strategies for learning health systems. Also included is a professional development goal to 4) ensure my
readiness to transition into an independent researcher and faculty member at the rank of Assistant Professor. In
addition, the training plan includes 2 goals in the R00 phase of the award: 5) successfully transition into an
Assistant Professor position and maintain a successful independent research program; and, 6) conduct a pilot
randomized effectiveness trial and use pilot data to write and submit a competitive R01-level grant to NCCIH.
The training plan includes an excellent research mentorship team with an established history of consistent
independent federal funding and mentorship to ensure that these 6 goals are met. Dr. Steve Zeliadt (Primary
Mentor) is an expert in pragmatic trial design, dissemination and implementation science, and quantitative data
analysis; Dr. Kurt Kroenke (Co-Mentor) is an expert in systems-based and stepped care models within primary
care settings for patients with chronic physical and mental health conditions; and Dr. Rhonda Williams (Co-
Mentor) is an expert in pragmatic clinical trial design for CIH interventions and the development, treatment, and
theoretical underpinnings of CIH interventions for individuals with complex symptom presentations. In Aim 1, we
will use patient semi-structured interviews and clinic focus groups to identify provider strategies and patient
perspectives relevant to treating co-occurring chronic pain and PTSD in a primary care clinic. Using proven
stepped care approaches developed by mentor Dr. Kroenke for pain and by consultant Dr. Zatzick for PTSD as
the foundation, our team will develop a CIH-based stepped care approach for co-occurring chronic pain and
PTSD in primary care guided by current evidence of CIH interventions while including patient, provider, and clinic
input. In Aim 2, we will iteratively refine the protoype using user-centered design strategies. In Aim 3, we will
conduct a pragmatic pilot trial of our CIH-based stepped care approach v. treatment as usual in two primary care
settings (one rural, one urban). The experiential components of each aim, combined with my mentorship plan,
will ensure my readiness for independence as an expert in the development and evaluation of systems-based
approaches for effectively delivering CIH interventions. The training goals and research aims align with the
important NCCIH priorities of CIH interventions for co-occurring chronic pain and PTSD and well-being."

Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, central obesity, type 2
diabetes mellitus and respiratory disease, are responsible for 80% of adult deaths annually, and are
responsible for having the greatest impact on health adjusted life expectancy and quality of life. Fetal growth
restriction (FGR; estimated fetal weight <10th percentile), which occurs in up to 10% of pregnancies, is
associated with increased risk of developing NCDs later in life. This is potentially because FGR results in
developmental programming of fetal tissues and organs in order to adapt to the adverse conditions resulting in
FGR, which persist into adulthood but ultimately predispose physiological and metabolic dysfunction. We have
developed the use of a polymer-based, nanoparticle that facilitates non-viral gene delivery specifically to the
placenta. Our placenta-specific, nanoparticle gene therapy is capable of increasing expression of human
insulin-like growth factor 1 (hIGF1) in multiple animal and human placenta models. Importantly, our
nanoparticle gene therapy is proven to be safe to both mother and fetus. We have consistently
demonstrated that treatment increases placental glucose and amino acid transporter, and growth factor
expression in diverse models of FGR (surgically-induced, genomic manipulation, maternal nutrient restriction
(MNR)) because IGF1 is central to most mechanisms responsible for FGR associated with placental
dysfunction, and a major regulator of placental and fetal growth and development. This proposal aims to 1)
determine the impact of placental nanoparticle gene therapy treatment on developmental programming in fetal
liver and kidney in late pregnancy, in the proven guinea pig MNR model of FGR, 2) Identify the mechanisms by
which manipulating placenta signaling with nanoparticle gene therapy affect communication with fetal liver and
kidney cells in human cell culture models, and 3) investigate the long-term impact of placenta-specific
nanoparticle gene therapy on offspring liver and kidney physiology and metabolic health. Preliminary
investigations confirm that placenta-specific, nanoparticle gene therapy increased fetal weight in preexisting
FGR using the guinea pig MNR model. Furthermore, short-term placenta-specific nanoparticle gene therapy
normalizes changes associated with FGR in fetal liver gene expression and kidney collagen deposition, hereby
establishing a model in which further investigations into developmental programming of fetal organs can be
investigated. This proposal is innovative and significant as it utilizes a nanoparticle technology currently being
trialed in the treatment of cancer, but in the setting of reproductive medicine, thus generating knowledge that
will inform clinical innovation in order to set the foundation for a healthy pregnancy and lifelong wellness."

Promoting inflammation resolution and resolution-dependent intestinal epithelial wound healing are recent
therapeutic concepts for IBD. During inflammation resolution, macrophages phagocytose apoptotic neutrophils
(efferocytosis), thereby preventing secondary necrosis. Macrophage efferocytosis also stimulates the secretion
of various resolving and reparative factors that can trigger intestinal epithelial wound healing. I previously
reported that dysregulation of macrophage efferocytosis and efferocytosis-dependent intestinal epithelial wound
healing contributed to pathogenesis in a murine model of Crohn’s disease (CD). The overall goal of this project
is to build upon my prior work to advance human pre-clinical research into resolution-based therapies for CD.
First, I seek to leverage innovative human models and unbiased analytical techniques to determine the cell-cell
communication between efferocytic macrophages and human small intestinal epithelium that drives epithelial
wound healing following inflammatory injury. This work will fill important knowledge gaps, identify potential
resolution-specific therapeutic targets, and define a physiological baseline against which to assess disease-
dependent dysregulation of this resolution/repair module. Towards this first goal, I have recently modeled
inflammatory injury in human ileal and jejunal intestinal epithelial organoid culture systems and shown that
human macrophage efferocytosis rescues this injury. I will interrogate this model with multi-omic techniques in
order to reconstruct potential ligand-receptor interactions and receptor-signaling pathways. Second, I seek to
investigate and translationally target potential disease-dependent dysregulations of macrophage efferocytosis
and efferocytosis-dependent human small intestinal epithelial wound healing. I have observed, consistent with
prior reports, that mucosal oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids including 12- and 15- hydroxyeicosatetraenoic
acid (HETE) correlate with disease in murine models of IBD and in IBD patient biopsies. In my human models,
these HETEs act as potential dysregulators of resolution—suppressing both macrophage efferocytosis and
efferocytosis-dependent small intestinal epithelial wound healing. I will investigate the mechanisms of these
dysregulations. Nonetheless, I had previously observed that the apolipoprotein A1 mimetic peptide 4F rescues
murine CD-like disease by enhancing mucosal excretion of disease-elevated HETEs. Pilot data show that 4F
inhibits HETE-dependent human macrophage dysregulation and enhances the clearance of HETEs across
human small intestinal primary epithelium. 4F thus appears to be a promising therapy against HETE-dependent
dysregulation of resolution and resolution-repair. After this study, I anticipate that I will have characterized novel
dysregulations of inflammation resolution and resolution-dependent intestinal epithelial repair that may amplify
disease in IBD but that can nonetheless be disrupted therapeutically by exploiting a novel mucosal clearance
pathway."

the interplay of HIV pathogenesis and opioid abuse in the gold-standard SIV/nonhuman primate system, using
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to assess individual cellular transcriptomes. This will give us obtain
unparalleled insight into the viral and drug-induced effects on diverse cell types in brain in regions critical for HIV
infection and opioid abuse. In addition, we will also focus on primary targets of HIV and drivers of
neuropathogenesis, microglia and brain macrophages, using scRNAseq as well as single-cell Assay for
Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing (scATACseq) to gain insight into the epigenetic regulation of
gene expression at the single cell level. These will be combined with state-of-the-art sensitive assays for virus
in the brain. We will ensure our data adhere to the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable)
standards, and will work closely with other members of the SCORCH program to share and disseminate data to
yield maximal advancement to the field. Our experiments are carefully designed to address the role of virus,
drugs, and their interactions, as well as include the clinically relevant scenarios of those taking antiretrovirals to
suppress virus, and those who do not. Our rigor and reproducibility are facilitated by our detailed power analysis
with proper sample sizes, as well as our experimental design to match the standards of blocking, replication and

 One of the critical challenges in the treatment of Glioblastoma (GBM) is the presence of highly resistant cells
with stem-like properties, called glioma stem cells (GSCs), that evade surgical resection, resist conventional
treatments and are primarily responsible for tumor recurrence. The perivascular niche within the GBM tumor
microenvironment (TME) has been well recognized as a critical site that shelters GSCs and promotes their
stemness, invasion, and therapeutic resistance.
 Extensive studies from others and our lab, using in vitro and in vivo models, have demonstrated that the
crosstalk between the endothelial cells (ECs) and GSCs regulates GSC proliferation, tumorigenicity and self-
renewal capacity. However, the perivascular niche is a complex microenvironment comprised not only of ECs
but multiple other cell types including astrocytes, pericytes, and immune cells. How the cell-cell interactions
between the various cellular components of the perivascular niche modulate GSC behavior (proliferation vs.
quiescence and invasion vs. homing) and therapy resistance is poorly understood. To address these unmet
biological knowledge gaps, there is a critical need for sophisticated and more realistic ex vivo tumor models that
better recapitulate the physiological complexities of the GBM perivascular niche to advance our fundamental
understanding of the biology of the disease and predict therapeutic responses.
 Recently, we have established and validated an on-chip microfluidic tumor model of GBM, with a unique 3D
organotypic architecture, to study the influence of the perivascular niche on GSC invasion. We have shown that
co-culturing of astrocytes enhances EC-induced invasion of GSCs, where RNA-seq analysis of mono-culture vs.
tri-culture provided a mechanistic insight into the receptor-ligand pairs that mediate the interactions between
cells. Based on these foundational developments, in this study our goal is to develop an ex vivo tumor model of
GBM, bioinspired from the native perivascular niche, with patient-derived cells to dissect the role of cellular
components within the niche on GSC biology and response to treatment at single cell resolution.
 In Aim 1, our objective is to determine the influence of the key cell types within the perivascular niche on
GSC-EC interactions. In Aim 2, we plan to mechanistically unveil the impact of radiation treatment on GSCs-
perivascular niche interactions, while in Aim 3, we will blunt invasion and sensitize GSCs through disruption of
niche-tumor cell interactions. Our study design uniquely employs an interdisciplinary approach including
microengineering of a bioinspired ex vivo tumor model, single-cell level resolution analysis, molecular-level
transcriptomics, and validation using ex vivo patient tumor samples. Successful completion of these studies will
not only further our understanding of the interactions of GSCs with the perivascular niche but will also facilitate
identification of novel targets to block disease progression."

Americans aged 65 years and older account for 70% of heart failure (HF)-related hospitalizations each year, and
many in this population are burdened by multimorbidity, functional limitations, and high symptom burden. As HF
becomes advanced (New York Heart Association Class III-IV) disease burden increases substantially, especially
in the last 6 months of life when 80% of individuals are hospitalized at least once and many endorse significant
distress related to functional decline and inability to participate in life roles and activities. Despite widespread
recognition of the distinct benefits of physical rehabilitation and palliative care in improving symptoms and quality
of life among individuals with HF, these services are separate in their approach and underutilized. To date,
physical rehabilitation models have not been designed to simultaneously address the complex psychosocial and
functional needs of older adults with advanced HF. To optimize quality of life in this vulnerable population, a
novel rehabilitation strategy that holistically addresses biopsychosocial impairments is needed. My K23 proposal
will address this need by developing and testing LiveWell-HF, a home-based physical therapy model
supplemented with evidence-based, psychological strategies from early integrated palliative care to improve
coping and acceptance among older adults after hospitalization for advanced HF. Specifically, I aim to 1) develop
the preliminary LiveWell-HF model with provider and patient stakeholder input; 2) refine LiveWell-HF using an
open pilot study design; and 3) evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity of the refined LiveWell-HF model
by conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial. Findings from these aims will inform a R01 efficacy trial as well
as future work to determine the impact of LiveWell-HF on healthcare utilization and an extension of the model
tailored for care partners. The aims of this proposal will be supported by my career development activities, which
focus on 1) developing advanced clinical and research expertise in palliative care, 2) qualitative and mixed
methods research to develop and refine evidence-based rehabilitation interventions, 3) clinical trials research,
and 4) leadership development. My exemplary team of mentors and advisors will be led by Dr. Christine Ritchie,
an internationally renowned geriatrician and palliative care physician with extensive experience conducting
mixed methods research and clinical trials in patients with serious illness. The complementary expertise of my
mentors and advisors, rich institutional environment at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical
School, and my training plan will enable me to successfully complete the training and research aims in this
application. This K23 proposal will provide me with the skills and data needed to launch my career as an
independent investigator and leader at the intersection of physical rehabilitation, palliative care, and geriatric
cardiology. Ultimately this line of research can improve the lived experience of older adults with advanced HF

Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men living with HIV (GBMSM-LWH) bear a heavy burden of
bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as gonorrhea (GC), chlamydia (CT) and syphilis. Left
untreated, bacterial STIs may lead to serious health complications. Inflammatory and ulcerative STIs can also
facilitate the onward sexual transmission of HIV in the presence of inadequate viral suppression. Timely
diagnosis and treatment are key to prevention. Sexually active GBMSM-LWH engaged in HIV medical care are
not being screened for GC, CT and syphilis at least annually, as recommended. Home specimen self-collection
has increasingly been used to screen for bacterial STIs in studies conducted with diverse populations. Telehealth
has also demonstrated promise in managing mental health and increasing antiretroviral therapy adherence in
people living with HIV. Only few studies have combined home specimen self-collection with live audio/video
(AV) conferencing, all of which have been restricted to people without HIV. None have focused on GBMSM-LWH
or incorporated motivational interviewing (MI), a client-centered, strengths-based counseling approach that
seeks to support individuals towards positive behavioral change. Integrating home specimen self-collection from
different anatomical sites of possible exposure with MI delivered via live AV conferencing might offer a unique
solution to engage GBMSM-LWH in bacterial STI screening. MI-guided discussions have the potential to
increase participants’ knowledge of bacterial STIs, enhance their intrinsic motivation to protect themselves and
their sex partners, improve their self-efficacy for specimen self-collection, and problem-solve barriers to seeking
treatment (if warranted) and repeat testing. Our sequential explanatory mixed-methods study seeks to explore
the feasibility and acceptability of a novel MI-based telehealth intervention for sexually active GBMSM-LWH. In
Phase 1, we will recruit 75 participants via mobile dating apps and social networking websites, and deliver a 3-
component intervention: (i) a pre-test live AV conferencing session involving an MI-guided discussion to elicit
awareness of bacterial STIs and fill any knowledge gaps, bolster the perceived importance of regularly screening
for GC, CT and syphilis, and improve self-efficacy for specimen self-collection, (ii) self-collecting at home and
returning by mail a finger-stick blood sample (for syphilis testing), a urine sample (for GC and CT testing), a
pharyngeal swab (for GC and CT testing) and a rectal swab (for GC and CT testing), and (iii) a post-test live AV
conferencing session involving an MI-guided discussion to prepare participants for receiving test results and
formulate personalized action plans for seeking treatment (if warranted) and repeat testing. In Phase 2, we will
conduct in-depth interviews with a purposively selected subsample of 20 participants who complete
progressively smaller subsets of the pre-test session, specimen return for bacterial STI testing, and the post-test
session to elucidate attitudes, facilitators and barriers related to engaging in each component of our intervention."
10824311,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cognitive constructs relevant to self-regulation, including cognitive control, attention, and working memory, are
a prominent focus of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative to characterize dimensions of individual
variation that convey risk for mental disorders. However, many of these constructs are limited by their vague
definitions, ambiguous links to neurobiology, and evidence that putative measures of such constructs have
weak psychometric properties, including poor reliability and an incoherent factor structure. Further, consistent
findings that people with multiple psychiatric disorders tend to display non-specific cognitive deficits that span
this array of constructs suggest that cognitive aberrations associated with psychopathology may be better-
explained by a higher-order factor than by discrete functions. We propose to evaluate whether efficiency of
evidence accumulation (EEA)—a cognitive construct that has been well-characterized in computational
modeling and neurophysiological research but has yet to be integrated with RDoC—can overcome many of
these limitations by operating as a higher-order factor within the RDoC matrix. EEA is a core mechanism of
evidence accumulation models (EAMs)—a predominant mathematical framework for explaining cognitive
performance— that has a precise computational definition across both psychological and neurophysiological
levels of analysis, clear biological plausibility, and strong psychometric properties. Prior work has established
EEA as a reliable factor that accounts for individual differences in performance across a wide variety of
cognitive tasks—from simple decisions to complex cognitive control and working memory paradigms—and is
impaired in multiple disorders linked to self-regulatory difficulties. We posit that EEA represents a higher-order
factor that accounts for a substantial proportion of the variation across cognitive domains in the RDoC matrix
and that weak EEA conveys risk for multiple psychopathologies, potentially by impairing decision making
across contexts. EEA has yet to be integrated with RDoC and, although trait (between-subjects) variation in
EEA is linked to psychopathology, the correlates of state (within-subjects) variation in EEA across real-world
contexts are unknown. We propose to evaluate EEA’s role as a candidate higher-order factor in the RDoC
framework and set the stage for a larger program of computationally rigorous research on EEA as a bridge
between neurobiological mechanisms and real-world behavior by completing the following aims: 1) define the
structure and boundaries of trait EEA as a higher-order cognitive domain in the RDoC matrix, 2)
develop and pilot tools for daily assessment of state EEA and its relations with real-world fluctuations
in contextual factors and behavior. This project has the potential to refine RDoC in a way that that better
represents cognitive risk factors for psychopathology (i.e., task-general and transdiagnostic associations
between cognition and psychopathology constructs) and allows it to leverage key benefits of well-established
computational models to increase the precision and biological plausibility of RDoC constructs and measures."

The goals of this proposal are to: 1) obtain experimental skills and career training necessary to develop an
independent research program investigating mechanisms of bone development and disease, and 2) characterize
a novel target of bone remodeling called G protein-gated inwardly-rectifying K+ channel 3 (Girk3), a key regulator
of potassium flux and physiological processes. Our data demonstrate that Girk3-/- mice develop high bone mass
after skeletal maturity and have low interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and other circulating cytokines. The overall
objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that Girk3 deletion enhances bone density in adult skeletons
by altering the secretion of IL-1β and other monocyte-derived cytokines that modify bone resorption. During the
mentored K99 phase, the specific aims are to identify how deletion of Girk3 in monocytes affects bone mass
(Aim 1) and to determine how Girk3 regulates cytokine production by blood and bone marrow monocytes (Aim
2). Methods used to evaluate the role of Girk3 in bone remodeling will include dynamic and static
histomorphometry, osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation assays, cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF), single
cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), and bioinformatics. Completion of this aim will facilitate my transition into the
independent R00 phase when the specific aim (Aim 3) will be to determine if Girk3 deletion can prevent bone
loss in a murine model of osteoporosis via inhibition of IL-1β. The K99 phase will be conducted at Mayo Clinic
and will focus on obtaining mentored training in professional development through meetings with a curated
mentorship team, regular attendance and presentations at research seminars and national research
conferences, participating in workshops on grantsmanship and responsible conduct in research, and seeking
out networking opportunities, as well as conducting the experiments in Aims 1 and 2 and publishing the results.
The R00 phase will be conducted in my independent laboratory and will focus on completion and publication of
Aim 3 and developing an R01 application based on the results. The proposed plan synergizes new skills in
osteoclast and ion channel biology, unbiased spectometry, single cell RNA sequencing and bioinformatics, and
bone histomorphometry with prior expertise in endocrinology and osteoblast biology to create my own unique
research trajectory. The career development plan and research strategy outlined in this application will produce
a robust foundation for an independent research career in musculoskeletal biology."

research. Dr. Hogan will learn the intricacies of alcohol administration studies and psychophysiological data
collection while gaining experience in the study of emerging adults. Emerging adulthood (EA) is a developmental
phase characterized by increased risk-taking behaviors, including heavy episodic drinking (HED). Although
alcohol misuse is normative at this stage, HED is associated with negative short- and long-term consequences.
Conflict in romantic relationships may be a particularly salient social influence in EA drinking behavior, but little
is known about the role of romantic partners and relationship functioning in HED in this population. The proposed
study addresses this critical gap in the literature. EA couples will engage in two conflict resolution tasks
interspersed with two alcohol administration procedures. Because high frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV)
is associated with alcohol use and emotion regulation during stressful experiences, HF-HRV and other
physiological data will be collected throughout the laboratory procedures. The candidate has assembled an
expert mentorship team who are perfectly positioned to achieve the training goals and research aims within this
application. Dr. Julianne Flanagan, primary mentor, is an expert in the study of relationship functioning and AUD
and AUD clinical trials among couples. Dr. James Murphy will provide mentorship on alcohol studies with an
emerging adult population and Dr. Jennifer Buckman will provide mentorship on psychophysiology and alcohol
use among emerging adults. Finally, Dr. Dominic Parrott will consult on the implementation of dyadic alcohol
administration procedures and enrollment of diverse couples. The proposed K23 award will provide the protected
research time, expert mentorship, and training opportunities to accomplish the following training goals: (1)
become proficient in the conduct of alcohol administration research paradigms, (2) expand and refine my
psychophysiological research skills, (3) gain a foundation in alcohol prevention literature and current prevention
approaches among EA, (4) extend my quantitative skills, and (5) increase my scholarly productivity and grant
writing skills. The proposed K23 award will be an invaluable asset in Dr. Hogan’s transition to becoming a
productive, independent alcohol researcher with expertise in critical public health priority areas."

Alphaviruses are human pathogens that represent a global health threat. Mayaro virus (MAYV) and chikungunya
virus (CHIKV) are alphaviruses that can cause acute disease with fever, headache, myalgia, chills, and long-
term debilitating arthralgia. Adaptation of CHIKV lineages to the urban mosquitoes Aedes aegypti and Aedes
albopictus has contributed to its worldwide distribution and led to large outbreaks. MAYV is thought to be
restricted to transmission by sylvatic mosquitoes of the genus Haemagogus, but laboratory studies show that
MAYV can also be transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, suggesting the need for improved surveillance and
countermeasures. I found that MAYV can infect Aedes mosquitoes from Salvador (Brazil) or Galveston when
present at titers found in viremia in humans. This project aims to understand how adaptive mutations and
interactions with hosts may lead to the emergence of alphaviruses outbreaks. My central hypothesis is that
mutations in the MAYV nsP3 gene can lead to efficient transmission by Aedes mosquitoes through promoting
viral-host interactions. I will address this hypothesis through three specific aims. In specific aim 1, I will determine
existing and prospective mutations in the genome of MAYV that function in vector competence of Aedes
mosquitoes. I have performed next generation sequencing of salivary glands of infected Aedes mosquitoes and
found 17 putatively adaptive mutations. I will find and validate MAYV minority variants that arise upon mosquito
infection using competition assays, 50% oral infectious dose experiments and dual host models. As a proof-of-
principle, I discovered an adaptive mutation in the virus non-structural protein 3 (nsP3). I will then determine at
which step of mosquito infection they are important through a series of dissections followed by titrations. In
specific aim 2, I will uncover the roles of nsP3 in mosquito infections and vector competence. I will assemble
nsP3 chimeras of different MAYV strains to identify regions that are necessary and sufficient for increased fitness
in Aedes mosquitoes and study a natural insertion that has evolved at least twice in MAYV strains, suggesting it
is adaptive, and its proposed changes in protein phosphorylation. In specific aim 3, I will assess how m6A
modifications on MAYV and CHIKV RNA may promote immune evasion and how these modifications in cellular
RNAs modulate the immune system. These modifications are thought to have key functions in immune system
regulation and immune evasion. I showed that MAYV has m6A modifications on its RNA which are concentrated
in the sub genomic RNA and promote viral replication. Completion of this project will have a major impact in the
control of alphaviruses by spurring novel surveillance strategies and countermeasures targeting virus-host
interactions. This project and career development award aligns well with my current skills and career goals to
become an independent principal investigator. It will help me fill gaps in my knowledge of vectors and to develop
key administrative and writing skills required to become an independent researcher."

This application will provide the Principal Investigator, Dr. Pamela Lutsey, with protected time and other
support to 1) accelerate a successful record of mentoring junior clinical investigators and graduate students
engaged in cardiovascular disease (CVD) patient-oriented research (POR), 2) obtain additional training in
pharmacoepidemiology, -omics and mentoring best practices and 3) advance her ongoing CVD
pharmacoepidemiology research program. Pharmaceuticals play a crucial role in the prevention and treatment
of CVD and other conditions. To improve the effectiveness of pharmacologic interventions on CVD outcomes,
we need junior clinical investigators conducting POR who have rigorous training and mentorship in the areas
of pharmacoepidemiology, clinical epidemiology of CVD, translational research methods and the use of
complex data sources. An expert in these areas, the candidate, Dr. Lutsey, proposes to apply K24 funds
toward the mentorship of POR scholars at the University of Minnesota who are committed to a research
career that will reduce the burden of CVD in the population through building rigorous evidence regarding how
to optimize use of pharmaceuticals in order to prevent CVD in at-risk populations and reduce risk of
recurrence among individuals with CVD. Aim 1 involves conducting pharmacoepidemiology POR comparative
effectiveness research to prevent CVD in at-risk populations and improve the outcomes among CVD
survivors. State-of-the-art pharmacoepidemiologic techniques will be applied to large administrative data
sources, specifically MarketScan and the Medicare 20% sample. Aim 2 will harness rich data from deeply
phenotyped cohorts to understand behavioral characteristics that influence the effectiveness of medications,
and glean added understanding of the physiologic mechanisms through which pharmacotherapies act. These
analyses will use data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study and the Multi-Ethnic Study
of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Findings from the proposed Aims will advance understanding of the role of specific
pharmacologic treatment strategies on CVD risk, and have potential to directly impact clinical practice,
reinforcing or leading to reconsideration of existing clinical guidelines. This proposal is structured to allow
trainees the flexibility to pursue their own hypotheses, motivated by their clinical experiences and interests.
With support from this K24, Dr. Lutsey plans to expand the breadth of her POR research activities, recruit new
junior clinical scholars into POR, and prepare them to make major scientific advances and launch their own
independent research careers."

Some of the most debilitating and detrimental aspects of serious mental illnesses (SMI) are the 1) social isolation
(low numbers of social contacts) and 2) the subjective experiences of social disconnection (loneliness) that
frequently accompany these conditions. Social isolation and loneliness have an immense impact on day-to-day
functioning in SMI and are associated with an overall poor quality of life and early mortality. Currently there are
no available interventions that can prevent or reverse these devastating consequences of SMI. This may be in
part because the underlying neural and psychological mechanisms of social isolation and loneliness in SMI are
poorly understood. However, recent clues from studies employing advanced neuroimaging and digital
assessment approaches can provide the basis for a new approach to investigating such mechanisms. Prior work
has indicated that objective isolation and loneliness are correlated but also somewhat independent. Recent
neuroimaging findings support this model, revealing that social isolation and loneliness have both shared and
distinct neural correlates. However, it is also clear that these are not static phenomena; smartphone-based
assessments have revealed transient, dynamic changes in social isolation and loneliness. Individual differences
in the anticipation of rejection are associated with momentary experiences of loneliness, greater avoidance and
subsequent increases in social isolation. Thus, in the current proposal, we plan to comprehensively measure
both the relatively stable neural and behavioral predictors of social isolation and loneliness, as well as the
moment-to-moment changes in these experiences, in 60 individuals with SMI and 60 without SMI. In Aim 1 of
the proposed project, we will show that the higher levels of social isolation and loneliness in SMI are linked to
shared and distinct neural responses to social stimuli, with lower responses of social perception-related circuitry
(medial temporal lobe regions) linked to social isolation, and lower responses of reward-related circuitry (basal
ganglia regions) linked to loneliness. In Aim 2, we will measure transient changes in social isolation and
loneliness with smartphone assessments using a longitudinal “burst” design. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will determine
how the correlates of social isolation and loneliness identified in Aims 1 and 2 are linked to each other and to
levels of functioning, and measure the stability of these associations over time. Therefore, in this project, we plan
to demonstrate that fundamental neural and behavioral processes drive momentary variation in the experience
of social isolation and loneliness, and directly impact functioning and quality of life in SMI. In follow-up work,
these findings can be used as quantitative targets in studies of novel interventions which aim to address these
major causes of disability and early mortality."
10877899,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Millions of cis-regulatory elements (CRE) have been identified in mammalian genomes, which harbor
large portion of GWAS variants associated with complex human diseases and traits. Interpreting the regulatory
target genes of CRE and GWAS variants remains challenging, as majority of genes are not merely regulated
by CREs in close one-dimensional (1D) vicinity. Instead, CREs can form DNA loops and regulate the
expression of gene(s) from hundreds of kilobases (Kb) away. Thus, deep understanding of chromatin spatial
organization can shed light on gene regulation and disease mechanisms. During the last decade, chromatin
conformation capture (3C)-derived technologies (e.g., in situ Hi-C, capture Hi-C, ChIA-PET, PLAC-seq and
HiChIP) have been widely used to provide a genome-wide view of chromatin spatial organization. However,
these technologies are usually applied to bulk tissue or purified cell lines, and cannot reveal cell-type-specific
chromatin interactome within complex tissues. Fortunately, harnessing the power of single cell technologies,
single cell Hi-C (scHi-C) and scHi-C-derived multi-modal assays, including single cell Methyl-HiC and single-
nucleus methyl-3C, have been rapidly advanced to study chromatin interactome at single cell resolution,
providing powerful tools to study chromatin spatial organization in complex tissues and disease relevant cell
types. While great strides have been made in scHi-C experimental technologies, computational methods for
analyzing scHi-C data are largely lagging behind. The methodological gaps fall mainly in three aspects: (1)
Current methods are inefficient to enhance resolution from extremely sparse scHi-C data. (2) Few methods
exist for removing systematic biases of scHi-C data within each cell, and adjusting for batch effect across
different cells. (3) No method is available to detect Kb resolution cell-type-specific chromatin interactions from
scHi-C data. To fill in these gaps, I propose major research directions: (1) develop deep learning-based
methods to impute sparse chromatin contacts in each cell, (2) develop non-parametric regression models to
remove systematic biases within each cell, and to adjust batch effects across different cells, (3) develop a
hybrid approach based on both global and local background models to identify cell-type-specific chromatin
interactions, and predict putative target genes of GWAS variants associated with complex human diseases and
traits, and (4) develop stand-alone, user-friendly software packages to analyze single cell chromatin
interactomic data and disseminate results. Completion of the proposed study will provide robust and user
friendly computational methods that allow us to analyze 3D genome organization at single cell resolution and
interpret their regulatory role on gene expression and complex human diseases."
10884516,"Summary of revised scope of work emanating from budgetary reductions: 
The number of training slots has been reduced from 10 pre and 10 post-doctoral positions per year to 5 pre and 5 post-doctoral positions per year. 
The percent effort for key personnel in leadership positions has been substantially reduced across all leadership positions. For some leadership positions, we have been able to secure modest institutional support to protect effort. 
We removed effort for members of Trainee Selection Committee and Diversity Committee. Members of these committees agreed to contribute without effort from the grant. 
We removed effort for members of Network and Career Development Cores. Members agreed to contribute without effort from the grant.
 5. We removed effort for the following non-key personnel: 
 a. Evaluation expert 
 b. Program manager 
 c. UIC Project manager 
These changes to the effort of non-key personnel will be dealt with in the following fashion: 
Evaluation of the Overall Program will be scaled down compared to what was described in the original application. Evaluation of the Training Core will remain comprehensive through evaluation services provided for research training programs through a new Core established at Northwestern University and supported through institutional funds. 
The effort of the Overall Program Coordinator, Terri Fraterrigo, has remained intact at 100%. A program assistant from the Center of Translational Metabolism and Health at Northwestern University, Anthony Tagliola, will provide support to the Overall Program Coordinator at no cost to the grant. He will be supported through institutional funds. 
The UIC program manager, Natalie Meza, will provide support to the Overall Program Coordinator at no cost to the grant. She will be supported through institutional funds. 
6. We reduced the amount of funds allocated to the Network Core. While these reductions will curtail activities originally proposed in the application, we are actively working to secure additional funds to support the activities and we will also work with the leaders of the Network Core to design new initiatives that will either be supported through institutional funds or will be organized at minimal cost to the grant."

Infectious Disease Research and Response Training Program (IDRRTP)
The Infectious Disease Research and Response Network (IDRRN) was established in 2016 and
has been recognized as a Program of Research and Scholarly Excellence (PRSE) at Colorado
State University. The IDRRN promotes the development of interdisciplinary teams to investigate,
study, and develop mitigation strategies for diseases locally, nationally and internationally. The
IDRRN uses team dynamics to focus on infectious and neurodegenerative diseases and
maximize the impact of its expertise in disease transmission and pathogenesis, development of
diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics, vector biology, epidemiology, and bio-engineering. The
IDRRN has a strong commitment and a proven track record in training the next generation of
research scientists who will continue to face pandemics while also confronting novel emerging
infectious agents. In addition to the rich scientific environment, there are vast, state-of-the-art
facilities featuring BLS2, BSL3, ABSL3 and GMP capabilities. The proposed training program will
support 5 predoctoral trainees for three years. The IDRRTP faculty are a diverse group
representing 7 departments from 3 colleges. Our preceptors include highly experienced senior
training faculty and 4 well-funded assistant professors to ensure training of future research
mentors. Trainees will complete personalized coursework training in microbiology, immunology,
pathology, statistics and bioinformatics to provide foundational knowledge, build critical thinking
skills, and ensure mastery of literature interrogation. Training in biosafety level 2 and 3
procedures, the responsible conduct of research, and methods to ensure rigor and reproducibility
will be specifically addressed and emphasized throughout every aspect of the program. Trainees
will participate in grant and manuscript writing courses that will yield submission-ready products.
Communication skills will be nurtured and practiced to ensure confidence and effective
engagement with scientific and lay audiences alike. A variety of other professional development
opportunities and tools will be provided to encourage life-long growth, improvement and ultimate
success. Finally, trainees will have opportunities to engage in research-to-market programs and
medium-scale biomanufacturing experiences to gain an in-depth understanding of the
translational process. Together, our training faculty, robust curriculum, synergistic training
activities, and unique experiential opportunities will provide diverse cohorts of predoctoral
trainees with the necessary skills to confront infectious disease threats to human health as they
embark upon academic or non-academic research careers."
10843845,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Liver disease is a pressing public health challenge, because unlike most other major killers deaths due
to liver disease are rapidly rising rather than falling. Although liver transplantation prolongs survival, there is a
growing number of patients in need of transplant, but donor supply has remained stagnant. To address this major
medical problem, we are working to build artificial liver tissue that could serve as a bridge or alterative to organ
transplant. A crucial remaining hurdle for developing artificial liver tissue is building the multiscale vasculature
needed to support billions of densely packed hepatocytes. Novel approaches that address this challenge would
transform liver research and therapy.
 Our recent work pushed the field closer to addressing this hurdle by introducing a breakthrough method
for 3D printing volumetric vascular networks in artificial tissues. This advance was made possible by addition of
photoabsorbers to stereolithography bioinks, which enabled millions of voxels to be patterned over many tissue
layers. Yet, tissues produced with stereolithography remain incompletely vascularized and sparsely cellularized,
with functional levels that still fall short of those needed for therapy. We have recently gained important clues
towards addressing this challenge. First, we identified new photoabsorber formulations that substantively
improve print resolution, providing a new route to volumetrically scaling a denser vasculature. Furthermore, we
found that adding biological matrices to bioinks allows us “expand” vasculature and hepatocytes within printed
tissues after implantation in the body to produce tissues with native density. These data lead us to hypothesize
that dual-role bioinks that support both technical and biological modes of scale-up will facilitate generation of
human liver tissue with volumetric vasculature that expands in vivo. Further, such tissue will have hepatic
functional levels sufficient to therapeutically treat liver disease. To test these hypotheses, we established a team
with synergistic expertise in liver and vascular tissue engineering, biomaterials and bioprinting, clinical liver
surgery, clinical hepatology, liver cell biology, and liver metabolism. We will employ our expertise to develop
vascularized bioprinted liver tissue that grows in the body. We will first formulate a new library of bioinks for
projection stereolithography with improved print resolution and bioactivity, to facilitate both 3D printing and in
vivo tissue engineering (Aim 1). We will then 3D print scaled vascular topologies that mimic liver vasculature and
support hepatocyte engraftment (Aim 2). Finally, we will trigger hepatocyte expansion in the tissues to achieve
hepatocyte density and functional levels sufficient to rescue mice with liver injury (Aim 3).
 The real power of this proposal lies in conflating bioprinting and biological modes of tissue scale-up,
which will transform tissue engineering and generate bioprinted liver tissue as a new therapy for liver disease.
The new material bioinks and 3D printing innovations developed in proposal would also be broadly useful across
diverse fields of translational biomedicine, such as heart and kidney disease."

The goal of this project is to develop a novel oral drug, R-5780, which engages microbiome-associated Pattern
Recognition Receptors (PRRs) to enhance the activity of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy for the
treatment of cancer. R-5780 is based on a unique enzyme known as secreted antigen A (SagA) identified from
Enterococcus faecium which our research team showed can engage microbiome-associated immunological
pathways of the gut and potentiate the effects of PD-1 and CTLA4 pathway targeting agents [19, 29, 30].
Gut microbiota are associated with remarkable effects on host health and disease, and discrete species of
commensal bacteria have been correlated with improved patient responses to cancer immunotherapy [7-14]. The
molecular mechanisms underlying these beneficial bacterial effects remain poorly understood. In particular,
specific strains of Enterococci have been linked with improved response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in
patients with metastatic melanoma, lung, and kidney cancers, but their mechanism of action has not been
elucidated nor employed to improve cancer immunotherapy. Recent work from our laboratory demonstrated
that these beneficial strains of Enterococci express the SagA peptidoglycan remodeling enzyme which, when
delivered recombinantly via a probiotic that does not endogenously express SagA, can potentiate the anti-
tumor effects of PD-1 checkpoint therapy in murine tumor model studies. The peptidoglycan metabolites
generated by SagA directly engage host PRRs activating key host immune signaling pathways [19].
While defined microbiome commensal strains may offer an interesting alternative to prevent and treat cancer in
combination with ICI therapy, many strains are not suitable for human use (including certain SagA positive
Enterococci), and the mechanism of action is difficult to characterize making drug development challenging.
However, recent studies suggest that improved probiotics engineered to carry specific recombinant biological
targeting agents to the gut can be an effective approach to target intestinal microbiome pathways. Indeed, our
recent results demonstrate that engineering or ‘reprogramming’ of probiotics to recombinantly express and
deliver SagA to the intestinal tract can impact immune responsiveness of cancer and greatly enhances the
effects of ICI therapy. These anti-tumor effects occur via intestinal PRR engagement. Our goal is to develop a
novel probiotic strain to deliver SagA (referred to as R-5780) as an orally administered drug that synergizes
with ICI agents to enhance effectiveness of immunotherapy. The key objectives of are to: 1) finalize R-5780
validation by determining activity in a second tumor model, and demonstrating preliminary manufacturability, 2)
perform necessary scale up process development to prepare for GMP manufacturing, 3) assess R-5780
activity in dose escalation studies and identify novel biomarkers that could be use in clinical trials, and 4)
complete an IND-enabling GLP pharm tox study.
Successful commercialization of R-5780 will profoundly advance immunotherapy treatment of cancer."
10892890,"The NaV1.5 voltage-gated Na+ channel encoded by SCN5A is the fundamental component of
macromolecular protein complexes that initiate the cardiac action potential. Abnormal NaV1.5 function is
a prominent substrate for inherited and acquired forms of cardiac arrhythmias, reflected by a staggering
array of identified NaV1.5 mutations. A small subset of these are associated with dilated cardiomyopathy
but the underlying mechanisms are not known. A leading hypothesis, that the arrhythmias drive the
cardiomyopathy, cannot explain why most arrhythmogenic NaV1.5 mutations do not cause
cardiomyopathy nor why knockout of the NaV1.5 interacting protein FGF13 leads to arrhythmias yet is
protective for pressure overload-induced heart failure (HF) despite associated NaV1.5 dysfunction.
Moreover, HF from other causes leads to pathological remodeling that disrupts regulation of the VGSC
macromolecular complex and increases arrhythmia risk through mechanisms that are poorly understood.
Complicating mechanistic insight is that there are different NaV1.5 pools defined by distinct subcellular
localizations with the cardiomyocyte, each hypothesized to have protein partners that uniquely define the
distinct pools and confer specific channel properties and functions. However, the critical partners remain
poorly understood because of challenges of low throughput “favorite” candidate approaches.
 We propose an unbiased multilevel discovery strategy, employing newly developed second
generation proximity labeling tools, novel mouse models, coupled with carefully calibrated cross
comparisons designed to increase the specificity of our findings. Exploiting the expertise from two labs
with individual and collaborative track records applying a large tool set to dissect complex physiologic
mechanisms and define perturbations in pathological states, we propose adaptable candidate validation
approaches to establish a comprehensive picture of NaV1.5 interactomes under physiological states and
when perturbed by disease. With these innovative approaches we propose to: 1) Define the static and
dynamic NaV1.5 channel interactomes and “neighborhoods” within distinct subcellular pools; 2) Elucidate
how HF alters the NaV1.5 microenvironment; and 3) Determine the HF-protective effects for ablation of
the NaV1.5 interactor, FGF13.
 With these aims, our goals are to define the contributions of the NaV1.5 macromolecular to
development and progression of HF and its associated arrhythmias and to unravel how HF perturbs the
NaV1.5 complex to increase arrhythmia risk and exacerbate HF in a vicious cycle."

This competing renewal application for an Institutional NRSA has the goal of continuing to providing education
and training to nurses at the predoctoral and postdoctoral level in the field of omics research. Omics research
continues to be relevant for nursing research, evidenced by the momentum for precision health care. Bringing
research efforts to bear upon clinically relevant issues requires that a continuous cadre of individuals receive
state of the science education and training to allow them to incorporate omics into their research trajectories.
Nurses are uniquely positioned to bridge the gap between omics research and clinical practice. They interact
with patients at all stages of life, and in all clinical arenas. Their work is interdisciplinary by nature. More nurses
are now receiving education in omics because of the inclusion of genomics into nursing curricula across the
country. Nevertheless, there continue to be few opportunities for long-term laboratory-based training in the
conduct of cutting-edge omics research. Such training opportunities are essential because nearly every
condition studied by nurse scientists, including those on the faculty of the University of Pittsburgh, School of
Nursing, has an omic component. Our objective is to train talented nurse scientists, at the beginning stages of
their careers, to develop research trajectories related to the application and evaluation of omics in improving
patient outcomes. The goal of the training program is to prepare predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees to
incorporate omics into their research trajectories using didactic courses, clinical rotations, journal clubs,
seminars, individualized practica, laboratory experiences, and presentations at scientific meetings. Objectives
of the program focus on training in: 1) the integration of omics into theoretical / conceptual frameworks; 2)
omics research methodology; 3) omics laboratory techniques; 4) clinical application of omics; and 5)
applicability of bioinformatics and genomic Big Data. Reasons why the School of Nursing at the University of
Pittsburgh continues to be the ideal environment for such a training program are elaborated in the application."
10809691,"Many leading questions in neuroscience such as how neurons encode experience, modify behavior, and
degenerate, require neural activity to be monitored throughout the brain in living animals. Neuronal activity is
tightly linked to an increase in intracellular calcium. Therefore, a cornerstone technology for monitoring neural
activity involves the use of genetically encoded fluorescent reporters of intracellular calcium. While fluorescent
tools for calcium sensing have proven immensely transformative for neuroscience research, optical approaches
do not allow neural activity to be monitored with brain-wide coverage or at any arbitrary depth. To address this
challenge, we will develop a new type of genetic sensor for visualizing cumulative calcium signals at a brain-
wide scale using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). To construct these sensors, we will leverage water
channels known as aquaporins. We will build on our earlier discovery that aquaporins can be used to generate
diffusion-weighted MRI contrast by increasing the rate of water exchange across the cell membrane. Unlike
conventional MRI reporters, aquaporin-based contrast does not involve the use of metals, thereby permitting
fully autonomous, single-gene imaging with high sensitivity. To accomplish our goals, we propose two inter-
connected specific aims. In the first aim, we will develop aquaporin-based reporters of calcium signaling (ARCS)
by assembling a synthetic multi-gene cluster for coupling stimulus-evoked rises in intracellular calcium to
aquaporin expression. ARCS will permit neural activity to be integrated over defined stimulation epochs in awake,
freely behaving animals and subsequently read out by MRI. Following optimization in cell lines, we will validate
key performance attributes and safety profiles of ARCS in primary neurons. In the second aim, we will establish
in vivo functionality of ARCS by imaging local and brain-wide activation in response to well-established
neuromodulation paradigms involving chemogenetic and optogenetic inputs to the ventral tegmental area (VTA).
Concurrently, we will benchmark ARCS against multiple complementary readouts of neural activity including
blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI, calcium-sensing fluorescence reporters, and c-fos
immunohistochemistry. The anticipated outcome of this project is an optimized and well-validated set of genetic
tools that will provide neuroscientists with new avenues for unbiased exploration of neural networks involved in
coordinating everything from sensory function to behavior generation."

This study investigates the ‘reactive’ immune system in tumors, namely the cellular and molecular allies that
allow immunotherapies to work. In the previous cycle of this funding, we discovered that one set of intratumoral
dendritic cells type 1 (cDC1) present tumor antigens to T cells and that natural killer cells provide critical Flt3L to
cDC1 cells within reactive tumor microenvironments. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that reactive
tumor immunity, based on CD8 T cells and those cDC1, has an archetype and a niche—a collection of cell
types that organize and support it. By defining those cells, their associated genes and their relationships, we
will be in a position to better create this niche and to thus engineer tumor clearance.
This program is unique in applying spatial transcriptomics together with genetic tools and conventional cellular
immunoassay methods to understand the critical phenotype-biology relationship between critical cDC
populations and their partners. The resultant discoveries will be formative for designing new ways to boost anti-
tumor immunity."

Challenges. The airway epithelium consists of various cell types – understanding cellular and functional
heterogeneity will have a significant impact on diagnosing and treating diseases. However, few analytical tools
are available to investigate spatiotemporal phenotypes of these cells on a global population scale.
Conventional high-throughput microscopy (HTM), although powerful for dissecting heterogeneous biological
processes, is significantly limited in multiscale imaging and analytics. Most HTM systems are constructed by
combining high-magnification microscopes with scanning stages; this configuration would entail high
complexity in the system design and operation, high cost, and slow image acquisition rates. Follow-on data
analyses, based on traditional ensemble averaging approaches, often lead to the loss of detailed mechanistic
information. Innovations. We will advance a “smart” imaging platform, M3 (Multiscale Machine-learning
Microscopy) for large-scale, live-cell analyses. M3 will integrate cutting-edge breakthroughs: Fourier
ptychographic microscopy (FPM) and deep learning (DL). FPM is based on a spatially coded-illumination
technique, collecting low-resolution image sequences while changing the position of a point-light source. These
images are then numerically combined to restore the whole Fourier space, allowing FPM to achieve both wide
field-of-view and high spatial resolution simultaneously. DL is potent in discovering intricate, hidden structures
in high-dimensional data sets with limited human supervision. We will integrate DL with time-series modeling to
learn disease-related cellular traits. Goals. We will implement the M3 platform and adopt it to analyze cellular
phenotypes during airway epithelium development. Aim 1. We will construct the M3 imaging system based on
the FPM technology. This system will feature i) a new numerical algorithm to reconstruct 3D volumetric images
and ii) multi-color imaging capacity for molecular detection. Aim 2. We will advance a DL framework for M3
image analyses. This framework will be designed to recognize different cell types and learn their
spatiotemporal features to unravel multiscale cellular heterogeneity. Aim 3. We will apply M3 to phenotype
cells in the airway epithelium. We will use an in-vitro model that uses induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to
derive lung epithelium. M3 will monitor cellular differentiation during epithelium development and examine the
correlation between cellular phenotypes and functionals. Impact. The M3 will bring unprecedented analytical
power to characterize diverse cells within the airway epithelium, allowing us to discover many hidden
phenotypes in cellular and tissue levels. Such knowledge would have implications for early disease detection
as well as designing effective therapeutics."

Aortic aneurysms (AA) are degenerative diseases characterized by dilation caused by arterial wall
microarchitecture destruction. AAs are a life-threatening condition with the potential to lead to dissection, rupture,
and even fatality. High blood pressure, atherosclerosis, and smoking increase the risk of AA initiation and rupture.
Some inherited connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan, Loeys-Dietz, or Ehlers-Danlos syndromes, can also
increase the risk for AA. Due to procedural risks, surgical intervention is only recommended for large aneurysms
or those with a high rate of growth. However, several small aneurysms rupture while many larger ones never do.
As many as 90% of detected AAAs are small and do not meet the surgical criteria; these patients are “watchfully
waiting” without any treatment. Currently, no pharmacological approaches are available to stop AAA progression.
We have developed a novel nanoparticle (NP) delivery system conjugated with a unique elastin antibody that
targets only degraded vascular elastin, a hallmark of all aneurysms, named DESTINeD. We have discovered
elastin stabilizing and regeneration potential of polyphenol-pentagalloyl glucose (PGG) when delivered with
DESTINeD. We hypothesize that increasing the strength of the aneurysmal aorta by stabilizing residual elastin
and collagen and regenerating lost elastin will prevent the expansion and rupture of AAs.
In Specific Aim 1, we will use an abdominal aortic rupture mouse models (Angiotensin II infusion with either
intraperitoneal injection of TGF-b neutralizing antibody or adding β Aminopropionitrile, BAPN in drinking water)
to test if rupture can be prevented using DESTIENeD therapy and whether arterial homeostasis will be restored
and inflammation reduced. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that degraded elastin-targeting PGG-
loaded nanoparticles can prevent aneurysm rupture in a mouse model of Marfan Syndrome. Marfan syndrome
is caused by mutation of the fibrillin-1 gene that causes dysfunctional elastin deposition in connective tissues,
and many of these patients develop severe cardiovascular complications such as thoracic AAs. Fbn1R/R
homozygote mice develop ubiquitous aortic elastin fragmentation, an inflammatory-fibroproliferative response,
and inflammation-mediated elastolysis so that 99% die of aortic rupture between 2-6 months of age. Here we
will test if our nanoparticle therapy can stabilize elastin and collagen and repair ECM and prevent aneurysmal
rupture and death. As a preclinical proof for our therapy, a swine model of the abdominal AA will be used in
Specific Aim 3 to test if DESTINeD nanoparticles, with a humanized elastin antibody, would arrest growth and
reverse existing AAs. If successful, ours will be the first injectable therapy that can be translated to prevent aortic
dilation and rupture."
10821434,"The circadian clock is a fundamental regulator of many aspects of physiology and behavior, including
reproduction. Reproductive success depends on appropriate daily timing of neuroendocrine events that control
ovulation. Kisspeptin (Kiss1) neurons in the preoptic area (POA) of the hypothalamus play a critical role in this
by driving the activity of downstream gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons to generate the surge in
GnRH and LH secretion that triggers ovulation. The surge in rodents is timed by the central circadian clock in
the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) to initiate just before the onset of diurnal activity, ensuring that ovulation,
which occurs a few hours later, coincides with sexual behavior. Projections from the SCN provide timing signals
to the GnRH neuronal network, including to POA Kiss1 neurons. Indeed, reports indicate that arginine
vasopressin (AVP)-expressing SCN neurons may play a key role in daily timing of the surge by activating POA
Kiss1 neurons. Our prior published studies provide evidence that SCN projections release AVP to stimulate POA
Kiss1 neuron electrical activity, and that this circuit is most effective in driving Kiss1 neuron activity on the day
the surge occurs. Recently, we have obtained exciting preliminary data that indicate that a distinct SCN
population releases GABA and inhibits Kiss1 neuron activity. These new observations, along with our published
work, reveal that SCN neurons may bidirectionally control the electrical activity of Kiss1 neurons, through the
release of GABA and AVP. This has led us to hypothesize that a shift in the balance of SCN-derived AVP-
mediated excitation and GABA-mediated inhibition contributes to gating the activation of POA Kiss1 neurons for
the surge.
 We will employ a combination of anatomical and functional approaches to address this central
hypothesis. Our first aim will be to establish that SCN neurons directly project to and release GABA on POA
Kiss1 neurons using brain slice electrophysiology and optogenetics. Further, we will determine the functional
impact of GABA release on Kiss1 neuron electrical activity across the estrous cycle. In the second aim, we will
use tract-tracing and immunohistochemical approaches to establish that SCN neuron projections target those
POA Kiss1 cells that are involved in the surge and determine the identity of the cells that contribute these
projections as well as their activation patterns prior to the surge. In our third aim, we will first assess the electrical
activity of SCN neuronal populations in the hours that precede the preovulatory surge. Using this information,
we will then determine how Kiss1 neurons integrate SCN timing signals, mediated through GABA and AVP
release, on the day of the surge. Together, this research will provide new information about the circadian control
of reproduction, and specifically the daily timing of the neuroendocrine events that trigger ovulation. A better
understanding of the neural mechanisms responsible for circadian regulation of these circuits under physiological
conditions may open new avenues for potential future treatments of ovulatory dysfunction."

Eccrine sweat glands are the most abundant gland in human skin and are essential for thermoregulation. Human
patients suffering from severe burns and sweating deficiency lose their ability to regulate body temperature,
which make sweat gland regeneration a critical and immediate next goal in stem cell therapeutics. However,
very little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in the sweat gland development and the regulation
of the epidermal progenitors that give rise to sweat glands. This proposal is built upon my previous work on the
identification of multipotent stem cells in the sweat glands and the molecular signaling events that specify the
sweat gland fate. Using the novel strategies that I had established to study sweat glands, I aim to investigate the
mechanical and signaling pathways that further shaped the morphogenesis of sweat duct and gland, with a
combination of technologies including microengineering technologies, mouse genetics, immunofluorescent
confocal and light sheet microscopy imaging, single cell RNA- and ATAC-sequencing, Fluorescent Activated
Cell Sorting, and tissue explant and cell culture systems. This proposed research plans upon completion will
provide significant insights into spatiotemporal control of the signaling environment for epidermal progenitor to
specify their cell fate of duct vs gland during development. Our studies will significantly impact on the field of
sweat gland biology and facilitate the development of novel strategies for future sweat gland regeneration for
patients in need."
10857318,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Widespread aberrant splicing is now considered a hallmark of cancer, and many of the resulting transcript
isoforms have been functionally implicated in tumorigenesis. However, the underlying regulatory pathways that
govern RNA splicing and the extent to which they play a role in cancer progression remain largely unknown.
Due to our limited knowledge of splicing regulation, we cannot solely rely on annotated pathways to study
changes in transcript isoforms. Moreover, bioinformatic strategies that are often used in discovering
transcriptional regulatory pathways often fail to capture the complexities of post-transcriptional regulation. For
example, common methodologies for cis-element discovery focus on sequence alone and largely ignore the
integral role of the RNA structural code in splicing. To address this challenge, we have developed a
computational framework that performs context-aware analysis of alternative splicing events to identify known
and novel regulators of RNA processing. Using this approach, we have discovered and partly characterized a
previously unknown RNA structural splicing enhancer (SSE) that drives aberrant splicing in highly metastatic
breast cancer. We have identified the associated RNA-binding protein that serves as the trans factor that
interacts with this novel SSE. We have shown that this pathway drives metastatic progression in xenograft
mouse models and that its activity is strongly associated with poor survival in patients. In this proposal, we will
build on this previous work to (i) perform a detailed dissection of this non-canonical regulatory pathway of
alternative splicing, its underlying molecular machinery, and its governing RNA structural code; (ii) evaluate the
contribution of this pathway to breast cancer progression; and (iii) establish the clinical relevance of this
pathway and its regulon to cancer."
10900475,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an important ischemic stroke risk factor, increasing the risk 5-fold and accounting for 1
in every 4 ischemic strokes. Extended rhythm monitoring for AF following ischemic stroke is recommended
because 10-20% experience recurrent stroke due to undetected AF and up to 30% of patients with ischemic
stroke are diagnosed with new AF after hospital discharge. Since 25-50% of AF cases are due to paroxysmal
AF, opportunistic screening with bedside electrocardiogram will miss a substantial portion of AF cases.
Implantable loop recorders (ILRs) are guideline-endorsed, long-term rhythm monitors that detect paroxysmal
AF. But universal ILR placement is suboptimal because ILRs are resource-intensive and only 30% of patients
who receive ILR after stroke are diagnosed with AF. An alternative, yet untested, strategy is to calculate patient
risk of AF in order to identify patients who are most likely to have undetected AF and will derive the most
clinical benefit from ILR monitoring. Using individual AF risk estimates can improve the appropriateness of
overall ILR use in a resource-effective manner. To test our hypothesis, the specific objectives of the current
application are to identify healthcare settings in which a risk-guided approach will be most impactful, develop a
post-stroke AF risk estimation tool, and pilot test the tool to assess acceptability, adoption, and validity of our
intervention prior to its testing in a randomized trial. Through the Mentored Career Development Award, the
candidate will undergo training in research with large healthcare databases, advanced prediction modeling,
and clinical trial methodology to facilitate transition to an independent investigator with expertise in prevention
and treatment of AF and its complication. The information produced from the proposed project will address
important knowledge gaps in healthcare utilization for prevention of AF-related stroke and inform future
effectiveness trials designed to directly inform selection of appropriate AF monitoring strategy following
ischemic stroke."
10857323,"Project Abstract
The opioid epidemic has become one of the most pervasive threats to health and survival in the U.S. Medications
for the treatment of opioid use disorders (MOUD) are the gold standard treatment, with robust evidence of
effectiveness in reducing opioid use, opioid overdose risk and opioid-related deaths. Nevertheless, retention and
adherence to MOUD treatment, particularly buprenorphine (BUP), are discouragingly low; as such, novel, cost-
effective, scalable intervention approaches to increase and sustain retention and adherence to BUP treatment
are urgently needed. With NIDA support (R34 DA033196), the applicant developed and evaluated, in a RCT, a
cognitive behavioral therapy-based short message system (SMS) intervention (TXT-CBT) targeting opioid use
and medication adherence among opioid users with HIV. This highly promising intervention demonstrated
efficacy in reducing opioid use and increasing biochemically-verified antiretroviral medication adherence,
findings that were replicated among HIV-infected alcohol users (R34 AA 022055). The objective of the current
research is to adapt and extend this approach to address MOUD treatment retention and adherence. To achieve
this, we propose a 2-phase study. In Phase I,: (i) TXT-CBT is adapted, with user and MOUD provider input, to
address critical barriers to retention and adherence to BUP treatment, and transported to a scalable, user-friendly
SMS platform, to form imFREE (Interactive Messaging for Freedom from Opioid Addiction); and (ii) Usability
testing of imFREE is conducted (n=16) in preparation for an effectiveness trial. In Phase II, (i) the effectiveness
of imFREE in improving BUP treatment retention and adherence and decreasing opioid use is evaluated in an
RCT comparing imFREE to an mHealth education control condition (mHealth ED) among individuals who are
initiating BUP, and (ii) we evaluate the cost-effectiveness of imFREE. This application is an excellent fit as a
response to RFA-19-006, “Behavioral Research to Improve MAT: Behavioral and Social Interventions to Improve
Adherence to Medication Assisted Treatments for Opioid Use Disorders,” which encourages “the development
of efficacious treatments for substance use disorders that are implementable and self-sustaining, as well as
optimal behavioral strategies to promote medication adherence and improve outcomes of pharmacotherapies.”
Consistent with the objectives of the RFA, imFREE builds upon the efficacious SMS-based TXT-CBT
intervention, with content addressing retention and adherence to BUP, including mitigating risk factors for
dropout. imFREE also targets decreased opioid use, with features to notify social and provider support contacts
in the face of treatment discontinuation and/or other indicators of relapse and overdose risk. By providing support
to maximize BUP treatment adherence, coupled with skills to prevent relapse, imFREE may provide a cost-
effective, easily deployable strategy for OUD treatment and prevention of overdose deaths."
10868753,"Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is a chronic disorder associated with numerous relapses and periods of
abstinence. Studies in CUD suggest that ~ 60 to 75% of abstinent addicts relapse over twelve months
(Aharonovich et al., 2003; Simpson et al., 1999). Documenting specific neurochemical abnormalities that
lead to relapse in individuals with CUD has the potential to accelerate the development of medications to
prevent relapse. Basic investigations postulate an imbalance between brain stress and anti-stress/resilience
systems as the underlying mechanism that drives negative reinforcement, craving, and relapse in addiction
(Koob, 2008). Nociceptin (N/OFQ), which binds to the nociceptive opioid peptide receptors (NOP) is a
critical component of the brain’s anti-stress system. N/OFQ exerts its anti-stress effect by counteracting the
functional effects of the primary stress-promoting neuropeptide corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) in the
brain (Ciccocioppo et al., 2001). Studies have also shown that acute increases in CRF and stress are
countered by increased NOP receptor expression (~ 10% ) in brain regions that regulate stress such as the
bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (Rodi et al., 2008). PET studies with the NOP radiotracer [11C]NOP-1A
show increased binding to NOP in CUD compared to healthy controls (HC) (Narendran et al., 2019). PET
studies also show NOP receptors to upregulate (~ 15%) in response to an acute intravenous
hydrocortisone challenge (1 mg/Kg). NOP upregulation may represent an adaptive mechanism in the brain
to counteract stress-induced increases in cortisol and CRF. Here, we postulate a failure in this adaptive
mechanism as a reason that leads to relapse in CUD. CUD subjects and HC will be studied with [11C]NOP-
1A before and after an intravenous hydrocortisone challenge (aim 1). Hydrocortisone is used as a challenge
because it increases cortisol and CRF in brain regions that regulate stress. We hypothesize that
hydrocortisone-induced increases in [11C]NOP-1A binding (DVT) will be smaller in CUD relative to HC, and
this will be associated with less time to relapse in a 12-week follow up. Mechanistic studies have also
shown N/OFQ to act on ventral tegmental area/midbrain NOP receptors to inhibit the firing of dopamine
neurons and limit reward to cocaine (Murphy and Maidment, 1999; Parker et al., 2019). Imaging
amphetamine-induced dopamine release in a subset of CUD subjects who participate in aim 1 will allow us
to link midbrain NOP receptor expression with ventral striatum (VST) dopamine release and examine its role
in reinforcement (aim 2). The aims proposed in this study have the potential to clarify the role of N/OFQ and
NOP in stress, reward, and relapse in CUD."
10808135,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 There is growing evidence that viral infections of the central nervous system (CNS) contribute to chronic
brain disease. During development, multiple viruses including cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, rubella
virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and Zika virus annually cause thousands of cases of microcephaly —
small head size resulting from impaired neurogenesis within the cerebral cortex. The sequalae of these viruses
later in neurodevelopment and adulthood are less understood, but here they also disrupt neurogenesis and have
been implicated in disease. These viruses share a common ability to eliminate neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in
the developing and adult brain. However, the complex biology of these viruses has precluded our ability to identify
a precise mechanism by which these infectious agents ablate neurogenesis.
 We recently discovered that the widely used recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) rapidly kills
dividing NPCs and early post-mitotic neurons in the adult murine dentate gyrus (DG) in a dose-dependent
manner. Unlike the other viruses described above, rAAV is replication defective and is not known to cause
significant pathology. This has resulted in its wide use as a vector in both experimental biology and human gene
therapy. However, evidence is mounting that rAAV-based gene therapies are not without significant risk, with at
least 7 rAAV-related deaths and numerous adverse outcomes reported in pediatric rAAV trials during the past
three years alone. While some of these adverse effects are thought to be caused by immune reactions to the
capsid or transgene, increasing evidence indicates that the rAAV genome, which contains two 145-base pair
DNA segments named inverted terminal repeats (ITRs), is a major source of rAAV toxicity. Our preliminary
experiments indicate that rAAV ITRs bind to and deplete Parp1, a first responder in cellular DNA damage
response (DDR) within the nucleus. Moreover, rAAV toxicity mimics pharmacological inhibition of Parp1, inducing
cell cycle arrest and cell death, and can be partially reversed by Parp1 activation. We aim to capitalize on these
findings to identify the cellular pathways that mediate ITR-induced toxicity and discern whether
therapeutic targets within these pathways are shared among viruses that cause microcephaly."
10828861,"Imaging of brain oxygen extraction fraction in vascular contributions to
dementia
 Vascular pathology is increasingly recognized as a major contributor to cognitive impairment and
dementia, and arises from many pathophysiological mechanisms including endothelial damage of
cerebral vessels, hypoxia, and blood-brain barrier breakdown. Vascular abnormalities have been
identified as white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
scans, but the heterogeneity of and mechanisms underlying WMH evolution remain unclear. This lack of
fundamental understanding of WMHs to predict cognitive impact is in large part due to limited imaging
technologies to directly assess brain pathophysiology in clinical settings.
 In this project, we develop and optimize a new MRI technique to assess a critical parameter of
brain vascular health, oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), in elderly patients with WMHs indicating the
presence of cerebrovascular disease. In ischemic brain disorders, vulnerable tissue around an infarct
compensates for reduced blood flow by increasing OEF, such that pathologically high OEF is an
important indicator of a “penumbra” of at-risk tissue. However, MRI tools to measure OEF are limited
by low signal-to-noise ratio and biological confounds on the MRI signal, and have not been fully tested in
elderly patients at risk of cognitive impairment.
 We aim to address these limitations by using a novel, clinically feasible MRI method to map OEF
in brain tissues. This quantitative BOLD (blood oxygenation level dependent) technique adopts a unique
MRI acquisition in synergy with a biophysical model of microvessels in each voxel to quantify OEF. Using
quantitative BOLD MRI in patients with vascular contributions to dementia (VCID), we will 1) characterize
OEF abnormalities in WMHs and surrounding penumbra for different brain locations and their relationship
to cognition; (2) associate longitudinal OEF changes with microvascular MRI markers of white matter
injury to establish an ischemic pathophysiological mechanism of WMH evolution; and (3) test the
hypothesis that OEF changes in white matter have long-range effects on functional connectivity within
brain networks that support episodic memory and executive function.
 Successful completion of this project will provide critical biological knowledge about oxygenation
in WMHs and link multiple vascular biomarkers in a mechanism for WMH progression over time. The
novel OEF MRI approach also shifts the paradigm in imaging of VCID toward quantitative, physiologically-
specific measures of vascular risk. Ultimately, non-invasive OEF imaging may detect early microvascular
changes that drive neuronal injury in cognitive impairment and dementia, and serve future longitudinal
studies of interventions to prevent cognitive decline due to vascular disease."
10885098,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Several pharmacological compounds have shown promise as interventional strategies for extending longevity.
One recently studied compound shown to improve healthspan and longevity is 17α-estradiol (17α-E2). 17α-E2
is a diastereomer of 17β-estradiol (17β-E2) with considerably less binding affinity for classical estrogen receptors
than 17β-E2. The NIA Interventions Testing Program has shown that 17α-E2 extends lifespan in male, but not
female, mice at two doses. The mechanisms that promote sexually divergent responses to 17α-E2 are poorly
understood and are aligned with the increasing recognition that aging and the incidence of specific diseases
often differ between the sexes. This project will explore potential mechanisms by which 17α-E2 modulates aging
and metabolism in a sex-specific manner. Successful completion of this project will determine: 1) if estrogen
receptor α (ERα) is required for 17α-E2 to elicit benefits on healthspan, disease pathology, and lifespan, 2) if
17α-E2 modulates metabolic parameters predominantly through hypothalamic ERα-mediated signaling, 3) if the
beneficial effects of 17α-E2 on metabolic parameters can be mimicked by activating hypothalamic ERα through
chemogenetic approaches, and 4) if the elimination of endogenous estrogen production render female mice
responsive to 17α-E2-mediated effects on metabolism, and if this is ERα dependent. We hypothesize that 17α-
E2 signals through ERα in male mice to enhance healthspan and longevity and that these effects are at least
partially mediated through the hypothalamus. We also hypothesize that female mice lacking endogenous
estrogens will beneficially respond to 17α-E2 in an ERα-dependent manner. Aim 1: Determine if 17α-E2
improves healthspan and lifespan in an ERα-dependent manner. We will evaluate the effects of chronic 17α-E2
treatment on indices of healthspan and lifespan in wild-type and global ERαKO mice. Aim 2: Determine if 17α-
E2 elicits metabolic benefits through ERα in the hypothalamus. We will evaluate the effects of 17α-E2 treatment
on metabolic and healthspan parameters in mice with a hypothalamus-specific deletion of ERα using stereotaxic
delivery of adeno-associated virus (AAV) that drives expression of Cre in ERα-flox mice. Aim 3: Determine if
chemogenetic activation of hypothalamic ERα-expressing cells can mimic the health benefits observed with 17α-
E2 treatment. We will evaluate the effects of stimulating hypothalamic ERα-expressing cells on metabolic and
healthspan outcomes via site-specific expression of AAV Gq-coupled Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated
by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) in ERα-flox mice. Aim 4: Determine if the elimination of endogenous estrogen
production renders female mice responsive to 17α-E2 treatment. We will evaluate the effects of 17α-E2 treatment
on metabolic and healthspan parameters in wild-type and global ERαKO female mice undergoing ovariectomy
or 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide-induced ovarian insufficiency. The ultimate goal of this research is to develop
sex-specific pharmacological interventions for attenuating aging and chronic diseases."
10661333,"Project Summary Abstract
Schizophrenia is a significant contributor to the global burden of disease. In India, this burden is further
exacerbated because individuals living with schizophrenia have limited access to effective psychosocial
interventions aimed at promoting recovery, rehabilitation, and community tenure, while there is inadequate
attention to managing co-occurring chronic medical conditions that result in significantly reduced life
expectancy among this patient group compared to the general population. There now exists strong evidence
demonstrating that community programs delivered in primary care and leveraging psychosocial interventions
combined with linkage to specialty psychiatric services are effective for supporting treatment and recovery of
schizophrenia in low-resource settings. Therefore, there is an urgent need to integrate these effective
programs into existing non-communicable disease care services delivered in primary care settings towards
scaling up community care for schizophrenia. With the accelerated adoption of digital technologies in the
health system in India, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, there are new opportunities to leverage these digital
devices to coordinate care delivery for complex conditions such as schizophrenia. We propose to capitalize on
this newly established digital infrastructure to support the integration of task-shared care for schizophrenia and
allow monitoring of mental health, physical health, and functional outcomes over time. Specifically, we propose
to train and supervise frontline health workers tasked primarily with addressing chronic health conditions in
community settings in the delivery of an evidence-based psychosocial rehabilitation program for schizophrenia
called the Community Care for People with Schizophrenia in India (COPSI). We will leverage our existing
collaboration and robust research infrastructure in both rural and urban settings in Madhya Pradesh and
Karnataka, India to conduct a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial to evaluate whether use of a
digital platform offers added clinical benefit and can support integration of this task shared care for
schizophrenia into routine primary care settings. We will conduct an individual randomized controlled trial
enrolling 240 adults with schizophrenia to evaluate whether use of the mindLAMP digital platform can enhance
the clinical effectiveness of the COPSI program in reducing disability for individuals living with schizophrenia.
We will also measure a range of secondary outcomes for physical health and lifestyle behaviors linked to early
mortality, and mental health. We will also determine whether the addition of mindLAMP to the delivery of the
COPSI program has an impact on implementation metrics when compared to delivery of COPSI alone. Our
study directly supports NIMH RFA-MH-22-130 by seeking to evaluate whether a novel digital platform can
support the clinical effectiveness and integration of a proven psychosocial rehabilitation intervention for
schizophrenia into the ongoing national roll out of comprehensive NCD services in primary care in India."
10862764,"Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains the major health threat in the U.S. The effectiveness of CHD
prevention measures, such as dietary and lifestyle interventions vary greatly between individuals and may be
ascribed partly to differences in gut microbiome composition and function. The proposed research aims to
elucidate a critical metabolic pathway through which human microbiome may contribute to the CHD etiology
and account for the between-person responses to diet and lifestyle choices. Specifically, we aim to evaluate,
prospectively, the association of the estimated exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major component of
the Gram-negative bacteria membrane, on CHD risk. We will also examine dietary, lifestyle, and microbial
predictors of LPS exposure and create an “empirical metabolic endotoxemia index”. Human LPS-infusion
experiments clearly demonstrate that LPS exposure induces potent innate immune reactions, including
inflammation and recruitment of leukocytes to endothelium, and predisposes humans to an elevated risk of
developing atherosclerosis. Circulating LPS concentrations are challenging to measure in large-scale human
population studies due to a short half-life and variability in assay effectiveness due to daily fluctuations and
interference from proteins in blood samples. More reliable biomarkers, including LPS binding protein (LBP) and
soluble cluster of differentiation 14 (sCD14), characterize LPS exposure, but have yet to be systematically
examined in prospective epidemiological studies with documented incident CHD. Further knowledge gaps
include a comprehensive evaluation of microbial composition and functional potential in relation to LPS
exposure. To address these scientific gaps directly, we aim to 1) evaluate LBP and sCD14 in relation to CHD
risk, 2) examine dietary and lifestyle predictors of LBP/sCD14 and derive an empirical metabolic endotoxemia
index of these biomarkers, 3) establish temporal relationships of changes in the empirical index with changes
in LBP/sCD14 levels, as well as CHD incidence, and 4) investigate the role of the microbiome in determining
circulating levels of LBP/sCD14 and their impact on mediating diet/lifestyle associations. These aims will be
realized among men and women participating in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) and the
Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII), who provided multiple blood and fecal samples. In addition to stored
biospecimens, these studies also offer rich, existing data, including gut metagenome and metatranscriptome
data, dietary assessments by 7-day diet records, and three decades of follow-up of diet, lifestyle, and CHD
incidence, that allow us to examine the aims in an efficient and comprehensive manner. Data to be generated
from this project will provide novel evidence that elucidates the complex inter-relationships between
diet/lifestyle, microbial composition and functional potential, LPS exposure, and CHD incidence. The evidence
will also inform the development of a more personalized approach to preventing and managing coronary heart
disease."
10886114,"Project Summary/Abstract
Psoriasis is highly linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD), including myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure and
CV mortality. An increased prevalence of CV risk factors in these patients only partially accounts for this
enhanced clinical risk. Although systemic inflammation is thought to be a key mediator of the onset and
progression of these cardiometabolic abnormalities, the excess CV risk conferred by psoriatic disease remains
understudied. We will use novel multi-modality cardiac imaging to quantify abnormalities in vascular health, and
cardiac structure and function and assess the association with cellular immunophenotype. The central
hypothesis of this study is that reducing inflammation with tildrakizumab, an FDA approved therapy for psoriasis
that inhibits the IL-23 and Th17 pathway of inflammation, will quantitatively improve myocardial blood flow and
coronary flow reserve (CFR) as measured by positron emission tomography (PET) over 6 months in patients
with moderate-severe psoriasis disease and enhanced CV risk. In so doing, improvement in coronary
vasoreactivity, endothelial function, and tissue perfusion may have beneficial effects on myocardial mechanics,
and ultimately, symptoms and prognosis. We propose to use two state-of-the-art techniques, quantitative
perfusion PET imaging and cellular immunophenotyping by single cell analysis [single cell RNA-seq, cellular
indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes (CITE)-seq] of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, combined with
echocardiography. In Specific Aim 1, we will evaluate whether tildrakizumab therapy will (1) improve coronary
vascular function based on CFR, (2) improve myocardial mechanics, and (3) whether this functional improvement
will be correlated with the change in CFR after 6 months of treatment. In Specific Aim 2, we will evaluate the
relationship between cellular immunophenotype and coronary vasomotor dysfunction and myocardial
mechanics, at baseline and after therapy with tildrakizumab for 6 months. The overarching goal of this proposal
is to use physiologic imaging techniques already available as part of routine clinical care, and novel cellular
immunophenotyping to investigate mechanisms linking psoriatic disease and inflammation to coronary vascular
health and cardiac structure and function. This study will address an unmet and needed clinical translation in
psoriatic disease. This research will be accomplished in the setting of a comprehensive career development
program designed to provide the candidate, an early career investigator with training in CV medicine and CV
imaging, with the skills needed to become an independent physician-scientist in CV medicine. Her long-term
career goal is to be an independent scientific investigator, integrating immunology with cardiovascular imaging
to better define the role of systemic inflammation in cardiovascular pathophysiology, and ultimately inform future
therapeutic trials. An outstanding mentoring team and advisory committee of established scientists in the fields
of CV medicine, CV imaging, Rheumatology, Dermatology, Immunology, and cellular biology will guide the
candidate in her transition to scientific independence over the course of the award period."
10874477,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The exposed epithelial surfaces of the body, including the skin, gut, female reproductive tract, and airways, are
colonized by microorganisms that contribute to homeostasis and disease. While the resident microbiota has
been extensively characterized in many of these sites, the ocular surface microbiome is relatively
understudied. The use of metagenomic sequencing approaches has facilitated moving beyond targeted
culturing approaches to more fully characterize the breadth of organisms present in a specimen. However, the
relative microbial biomass at the ocular surface is much lower than other mucosal surfaces, such as the gut.
Metagenomic characterization of low microbial biomass specimens presents numerous challenges, as sources
of contamination not only arise during the sampling procedure and from the environment itself, but even from
laboratory processing methods. As a result, the lack of protocol standardization and omission of key controls
for sources of contamination limits the interpretation and potential for comparison across studies. To address
these challenges, we have assembled a large multidisciplinary team of experts in topics including (i)
development of standardized protocols and clinical validation of diagnostic tests utilizing metagenomic
sequencing for low biomass biospecimens, (ii) development of open source metagenome analysis tools, (iii)
clinical assessment of ocular surface and external eye findings among a large, diverse patient population, and
(iv) wet lab characterization of microbes under strict cleanliness guidelines. We previously described the use of
metagenomic sequencing to detect the presence of pathogens in biopsies from the brain, paraffin embedded
ocular tissue specimens, and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). By comparing a range of specimen pre-treatment and
processing approaches and sophisticated software tools, we were able to optimize the methods to maximize
organism detection and minimize or remove contamination. We validated our metagenomic sequencing and
analytical approaches to the rigor required for use as a diagnostic test. Here, we hypothesize that following
similar approaches with low microbial biomass ocular specimens will facilitate the characterization of the
healthy ocular surface microbiome. In Aim 1, we will compare specimen processing approaches and validate
our analytical methods. In Aim 2, we will compare specimen collection approaches, including collection
materials and procedures. We will then use our optimized specimen collection and processing approaches to
collect ocular specimens longitudinally for characterization of organism persistence. In Aim 3, we will identify a
subset of participants with persistent and/or unique organisms to collect additional specimens for validation of
composition and characterization of viability. Upon study completion, we will have contributed to the
characterization and understanding of the healthy ocular surface microbiome, and developed protocols,
analytical tools, and datasets that will be made publicly available."
10893333,"The Vitamin D Workshop is a non-profit educational organization (est. 1977) whose mission is to organize
scientific meetings on the metabolism, biological functions, and health effects of vitamin D. The goal of this R13
grant application to support a series of annual Vitamin D Workshops from 2021-2025. To date there have been
22 highly successful international Vitamin D Workshops which have typically attracted 200-300 basic
researchers, translational scientists, clinicians, and policy makers from around the globe. Vitamin D is the
precursor for an active steroid hormone that activates a nuclear receptor (the Vitamin D receptor, or VDR) to
regulate gene expression. Its traditional role is to regulate the biology of cells in the bone, kidney, and intestine
to control calcium and bone metabolism. Vitamin D can be obtained through diet and supplements as vitamins
D2 and D3, and vitamin D3 can also be synthesized in skin upon exposure to UV light. Both the skin production
of vitamin D and the molecular actions controlling calcium metabolism are suppressed by aging. Many studies
have associated vitamin D status with a wide variety of physiologic and age-related, pathologic processes, e.g.
cancer, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel disease. While this research has generated
considerable media attention, it has also led to many new questions about the molecular actions of the vitamin
D hormone, the challenges of assessing vitamin D status and the optimal intake to prevent chronic diseases. It
is not clear how aging, ethnicity and genetics influence vitamin D actions, and how requirements are altered in
diverse populations. These issues are of great interest to scientists, health professionals and the general public.
Collectively, these factors justify an annual meeting of vitamin D scientists to share research ideas and
resources, discuss the emerging basic and applied data, and bring areas of controversy to light.
The Specific Aims of the Vitamin D Workshops are:
1. To conduct a series of scientific conferences on the biology and health-relevant applications of vitamin D that
address:
 • The latest peer-reviewed scientific research regarding the production, metabolism and mechanisms of
 action of vitamin D as they relate to physiologic state and age.
 • The concern of worldwide vitamin D deficiency across age groups as well as how to best identify, treat
 and prevent this condition in different populations and age groups.

 Background. Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) present with advanced histological grade and
aggressive clinical behavior. They are overwhelmingly unresponsive to conventional systemic treatments, and
patients with refractory disease have increased recurrence and dismal 5-year survival rates. Reliable
biomarkers and targeted therapies for TNBC are therefore critically needed, but remain to be defined.
 Preliminary findings. We found that PTX3 was particularly abundant in TNBC specimens and in patient-
derived xenografts (PDX), and that its levels positively and specifically correlated with adverse TNBC patient
survival. We show that PTX3 propagated cancer-stem-cell (CSC) -like traits, that it promoted cancer cell
growth in suspension, and that it promoted multifold increase in TNBC metastasis. In addition, we demonstrate
that PTX3 activated anti-apoptotic pathways and de-sensitized TNBC cells to chemotherapy. Genetic
suppression of PTX3 inhibited oncogene-induced cell growth, and quelled malignant features of TNBC cells,
such as migration and anchorage-independent growth. Importantly, we show that circulating levels of PTX3,
which is secreted by TNBC cells, associated with tumor burden in preclinical models and were particularly
elevated in TNBC patients. Finally, we show that antibody neutralization of PTX3 caused TNBC cell death.
 Hypotheses. We hypothesize that PTX3 is a critical biomarker for risk stratification of TNBC patients, and
that it is a decisive functional driver of malignancy and a tractable therapeutic target of translational utility in
TNBC management.
 Specific aims and study design. We will establish PTX3 as a prognostic biomarker in clinical TNBC (aim
1), determine how PTX3 regulates malignant progression (aim 2), and establish PTX3 as a TNBC therapeutic
target (aim 3). To this end, we will correlate tumoral and circulating levels of PTX3 to patient survival in
retrospective analyses of a large TNBC patient cohort using PCR-, -in situ, and ELISA-based approaches
(aims 1.1 and 1.2). We will then determine the role of PTX3 in regulating self-renewal and tumor-initiating
functions of CSCs (aim 2.1), identify the metastatic steps facilitated by PTX3 (aim 2.2) and assess its
contributions to chemoresistance in vitro and in vivo (aim 2.3). Finally, we will determine the essentiality of
PTX3 to the initiation (aim 3.1), survival, and growth of established metastases (aim 3.2) using xenograft
models, as well as investigate the ability of anti-PTX3 neutralizing antibodies to suppress tumorigenic growth
using patient-derived xenograft and syngeneic murine cancer models (aim 3.3).
 Impact. Our sought results will introduce novel theranostics of potential groundbreaking utility in managing
aggressive and difficult-to-treat breast cancers for which targeted therapies are sorely needed."

Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a major complication of diabetes. These sores, if left untreated, can become
infected and become a serious threat to the patient’s well being. Although the field of wound care management
is well established, the effective treatment of chronic DFUs remains a challenge. The primary goal in the
treatment of DFUs is for the wound to close as soon as possible and to do so in a durable way. However,
prolonged inflammation, oxidative tissue damage, and impaired blood circulation in diabetic wounds delay the
wound healing process, resulting in open, non-healing wounds that often lead to limb amputations. This proposal
will address these problems by developing a versatile wound dressing that restores normal wound healing rates
by reducing free radicals in the wound, providing a native-like scaffold for the cells to divide and migrate, and
enhancing vascularization in the wound. Another problem is the inability to monitor the wound in real time after
the patient leaves the hospital, leading to digit or limb amputations. We will address this problem by developing
a wireless system that can monitor the temperature and pH of the wound in real time, parameters that have been
shown to be indicators of infection. Therefore, the overall goal of this proposal is to develop a shape-
conforming antioxidant dressing that upon exposure to body temperature transforms into a gel that
promotes new tissue formation in diabetic wounds and a feedback system that involves tissue
conforming sensors to monitor bacterial infection and/or lack of healing. Toward this goal, we have
developed a novel macromolecule - poly (polyethylene glycol citrate-co-N isopropyl acrylamide) - that
incorporates a laminin-derived peptide. This material, referred to as PPCN-A5G81, supports tissue regeneration
and can conform to the unique shape and depth of a wound. As for wireless monitoring of the wound, we
pioneered the development of flexible, stretchable electronic sensors that can be integrated with human skin or
implanted into the body for continuous, non-invasive health monitoring and treatment of disease. We hypothesize
that: 1) incorporating immobilized Cu2+ into PPCN-A5G81 will confer vasculoinductive properties that significantly
increase PPCN-A5G81’s ability to restore normal healing rates of full thickness dermal wounds in diabetic mouse
and swine models; and 2) conforming temperature and pH sensors are safe and can remotely provide real time
information regarding blood perfusion and infection in dermal wounds in diabetic animals. The specific aims of
this proposal are to: 1) fabricate a PPCN-based regenerative dressing with vasculoinductive, dermoconductive,
and dermoinductive properties and investigate its safety and efficacy for healing full thickness wounds in diabetic
mice and diabetic pigs with metabolic syndrome; and 2) fabricate and characterize telemetric wound feedback
tissue-conforming sensors capable of measuring temperature and pH in infected and non-infected diabetic
dermal wounds. Results from this research will contribute to the development of innovative clinical products that
reduce amputation rates and improve patient outcome."
10885049,"Previous work from the Tsai lab (Canter et al 2019) identified the mamillary body (MB) as one of
the first sites of amyloid deposition in 5XFAD model mice, a region that also correlates with
dementia severity in human patients. Single cell RNA sequencing of the mouse MB identified 2
distinct neuronal populations within the MB, with segregated distribution, target projection, and
unique electrophysiology. Analysis of these populations in the 5XFAD mice found that one of
these populations, those found in the lateral MB (LM), are uniquely susceptible to hyperactivity
and neurodegeneration, while the second population (medial MB, MM) is largely unaffected.
The activity of the LM population also directly contributes to mouse performance in memory
tasks. Additionally, using iterative direct-expansion microscopy (idExM) from the Boyden lab, we
have identified intriguing patterns of amyloid associated with specific projections in the fornix,
the white matter tract from the subiculum with axonal inputs to the MB. This grant proposes to
investigate the links between amyloid and excitability changes in the MB and fornix, including
development of the tools necessary to achieve this goal. The hypothesis to be tested in this
application is that amyloid preferentially associates with the subiculum-LM projection and that
these axons exhibit hyperexcitability. Aim 1 will map the connections between this new
population of LM neurons and its upstream inputs from the hippocampus, using a newly
developed in situ sequencing techniques, as well as exploring pathology in the white matter
projection regions of this circuit in 5XFAD mice and human brain samples, using recently
developed expansion microscopy. Aim 2 will characterize the source and location of
hyperactivity found in the LM neurons through advanced voltage imaging, as well as expand this
work to other mouse models of AD. Aim 3 will use optogenetics and pharmacological
approaches to determine if specific aberrant circuit activity drives the pathology and behavioral
changes seen in the AD model mice."
10874761,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from autoimmune-mediated destruction of pancreatic β-cells. Despite its
autoimmune etiology, emerging data suggest that intrinsic β-cell stress and defective adaptive stress responses
can play an important role in the loss of functional β-cell mass in T1D. However, the molecular mechanisms by
which the stress responses regulate β-cell death/survival in T1D have remained elusive, due primarily to a lack of in
vivo preclinical genetic models, hindering the development of novel, effective, and alternative therapeutic strategies
against T1D. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is caused by protein misfolding, chronic inflammation, and
environmental factors. Upon ER stress, the unfolded protein response (UPR), a signaling cascade mediated by ER
membrane-localized sensors ATF6, IRE1α and PERK, is triggered to re-establish cellular homeostasis. While these
proteins induce adaptive responses under acute stress, under prolonged stress the UPR initiates apoptosis. The
decision mechanisms for switching between adaptive and maladaptive responses, and the specific adaptive or
maladaptive functions of each UPR sensors in distinct cell types and disease contexts, are yet to be
uncovered.
To this end,
we have recently deleted Atf6 in β-cells (Atf6β-/-) of a well-established preclinical T1D
model, non-obese diabetes (NOD) mice, before the initiation of islet inflammation. Remarkably, Atf6β-/- mice
exhibited significantly reduced diabetes incidence . Transcriptome analysis of sorted β-cells of NOD Atf6β-/- mice
revealed p53/p21 signaling pathway as the top enriched pathway and uncovered a previously not recognized
pro-survival adaptative program in β-cells during T1D progression, which ultimately confers protection from
T1D. Atf6β-/- mice also showed reduced insulitis and increased expression of immune inhibitory markers in β-
cells, suggesting a non-cell autonomous effect of loss of function of Atf6 on the immune system. Therefore, in
light of these data we hypothesize that upon loss of Atf6 in β-cells, a novel adaptive program governed by p21
signaling prevails, which in a non-cell autonomous manner alters β-cells-immune cell communication. Moreover,
we hypothesize that under acute versus mild and prolonged stress conditions ATF6 triggers distinct transcriptional
programs to regulate cellular homeostasis in human β-cells. Here, by utilizing a mouse model and human islets
combined with a comprehensive toolbox of techniques and novel reagents we propose to (i) identify the
mechanisms, by which loss of Atf6 in b-cells impact, b-cell-immune cell crosstalk (ii) define the mechanisms of p21
upregulation and reduced pathology in Atf6β-/- mice, and (iii) determine the ATF6-mediated stress adaptation
mechanisms in human islets exposed to acute and prolonged ER stress. The successful completion of these
studies will fill an existing gap in our knowledge base regarding the function of Atf6 in β-cells, identify a novel
mechanism for β-cell-immune cell crosstalk, and significantly improve our understanding of mechanisms of β-
cell failure in T1D. It will also provide mechanistic insight for future studies and support alternative translational
strategies for T1D that target the b-cell UPR."
10877792,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Neurodevelopmental processes are shaped by dynamic interactions between genes and environments.
Maladaptive experiences early in life can alter developmental trajectories, leading to harmful and enduring
developmental sequelae. Pre- and postnatal hazards include maternal substance exposure, toxicant
exposures in pregnancy and early life, maternal health conditions, parental psychopathology, maltreatment,
structural racism, and excessive stress. To elucidate how various environmental hazards impact child
development, it is imperative that a normative template of developmental trajectories over the first 10 years of
life be established based on a sufficiently large and demographically diverse sample of the US population. To
accomplish this, the Healthy Brain and Child Development National Consortium (HBCD-NC) has been formed
to deploy a harmonized, optimized, and innovative set of neuroimaging (MRI, EEG) measures complemented
by an extensive battery of behavioral, physiological, and psychological tools, and biospecimens to understand
neurodevelopmental trajectories in a sample of 7,500 mothers and infants enrolled at 24 sites across the
United States (US). The HBCD-NC will carry out a common research protocol under direction of the HBCD-
NC Administrative Core (HCAC) and will assemble and distribute a comprehensive and well-curated research
dataset to the scientific community at large under the direction of the HBCD-NC Data Coordinating Center
(HDCC). The overarching goal of the HBCD-NC is to create a comprehensive, harmonized, and high-
dimensional dataset that will characterize typical neurodevelopmental trajectories in US children and that will
assess how biological and environmental exposures affect those trajectories. A special emphasis will be
placed on understanding the impact of pre- and postnatal exposure to opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco
and/or other substances. To address these broad objectives, the sample of women enrolled will include: 1) a
racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse cohort that is representative of the US population; 2)
pregnant woman with use of targeted substances (opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco); and 3)
demographically and behaviorally similar women without substance use in pregnancy to enable valid causal
inferences. In addition, the HBCD-NC will identify key developmental windows during which both harmful and
protective environments have the most influence on later neurodevelopmental outcomes. The large, multi-
modal, longitudinal, and generalizable dataset that will be produced for the first time by this study will provide
novel insights into child development using state-of-the-art methods. The HBCD-NC study will inform public
policy to improve the health and development of children across the nation."
10837136,"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) frequently co-occurs with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among U.S.
military veterans. Compared to veterans with AUD only, veterans with AUD/PTSD have greater symptom
severity, more psychosocial functioning difficulties, and higher risk of suicide. Many people with AUD/PTSD
perform behaviors aimed at avoiding unpleasant emotions (e.g., drinking to avoid trauma-related nightmares,
skipping social events to avoid anxiety-provoking crowds). These “avoidance behaviors” provide temporary
relief from unpleasant emotions, but they maintain AUD/PTSD and interfere with long-term functioning.
Although treatments for AUD/PTSD exist, they focus on reducing symptoms (not improving functioning) and
have dropout rates as high as 50%. Originally developed to treat depression, Behavioral Activation (BA) is an
intervention that increases daily participation in rewarding, alcohol-free activities relevant to patients’ social,
vocational, and health-related values. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) adapting BA for other disorders
have shown that BA is efficacious for adults with alcohol/drug use disorders and acceptable to veterans with
PTSD, but BA has not been used to treat co-occurring AUD/PTSD. Additionally, because RCTs of AUD/PTSD
treatments typically emphasize significant mean group differences in AUD/PTSD outcomes, less is known
about the degree to which these treatments yield clinically significant improvements at the individual level.
Individual-level improvements in AUD/PTSD should be evident not only in subjective clinical assessments, but
also in objective measures of geospatial activity. Specifically, patients’ daily geospatial activity is likely to
change as they decrease their avoidance behaviors and increase their engagement in various social,
vocational, and health-promoting activities. Advances in geospatial methods, coupled with discreet and
portable Global Positioning System (GPS) trackers, have made it possible to objectively measure people’s
spatial movement within their communities. Yet although geospatial methods have been used to identify social
determinants of alcohol use, they have not been used to measure response to AUD or AUD/PTSD treatment.
As the long-term objectives of this work are to identify a more acceptable AUD/PTSD treatment option and
improve the measurement of AUD/PTSD recovery, this R34 project will address the following specific aims:
(1) adapt BA for use with veterans with AUD/PTSD; (2) evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary
effects of BA (relative to Relapse Prevention) for veterans with AUD/PTSD in a pilot RCT; and (3) explore
geospatial analysis of GPS-collected data as a new approach to measuring AUD/PTSD treatment response.
This study will advance research and practice by piloting a novel application of BA and a novel measure of
AUD/PTSD recovery. This project aligns with the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism’s special
interest in investigating treatments for patients with AUD and co-occurring disorders, dimensions of functioning
and well-being associated with recovery, and innovative methods for evaluating AUD treatment and recovery."
10794395,"ABSTRACT: To develop treatments, it is vital to identify neural mechanisms underlying relapse in opioid use
disorder. To dissect neural activity underlying relapse, we developed a novel assay allowing for in vivo two-
photon calcium imaging while head-fixed mice engage in heroin self-administration. Using this approach, we
find global excitatory activity in the prelimbic-prefrontal cortex (PrL) decreases with acquisition of heroin
seeking, an effect that persists through extinction, but then resurges during reinstatement. These dysregulated
global PrL dynamics mirror clinical observations that are considered hallmarks of substance use disorder.
Importantly, our approach has identified, for the first time, that PrL activity dynamics emerging during
acquisition, extinction, and reinstatement are heterogenous, with distinct ensembles exhibiting unique
excitatory and inhibitory activity dynamics aligned with behavioral epochs. How these unique activity dynamics
guide drug seeking, however, is unknown. This implies greater resolution of PrL activity dynamics is necessary
to determine how they functionally regulate behavior. Here, under the expert guidance of Drs. Jim Otis and
Peter Kalivas, my K99 training in advanced computational neural analyses and single-cell optogenetics paired
with in vivo calcium imaging will resolve the function of discrete PrL ensemble dynamics for relapse (Aim 1).
 Notably, there are subpopulations of individuals with substance use disorder in whom relapse may
emerge through different neurobiological mechanisms. Females form one such subpopulation, as they exhibit
enhanced relapse vulnerability and greater prefrontal activity during craving and relapse compared to males.
However, this vulnerability covaries with the ovarian hormone cycle, such that peak circulating levels of
progesterone (PROG) appear protective. These effects are mediated by its 5alpha-reductase neuroactive steroid
metabolite, allopregnanolone (ALLO), which can influence prefrontal circuitry and promote adaptive responding
in females. As ALLO acts as a positive allosteric modulator at GABA-A receptors, it likely constrains PrL neuronal
activity to suppress drug seeking. As I find ALLO can act directly within PrL to suppress heroin-seeking
reinstatement, I hypothesize that PROG and ALLO can disrupt PrL activity dynamics which functionally guide
reinstatement. During the R00 phase, my career goal to be an independent investigator will involve building a
research program wherein I resolve the influence of PROG and ALLO on PrL activity dynamics during
reinstatement using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging. As activation of PrL projections to the nucleus
accumbens core (NAcC) is necessary for reinstatement, I will retro-label PrL-NAcC neurons to enable
simultaneous monitoring of global PrL and PrL-NAcC ensembles (Aim 2). Using single-cell optogenetic and
circuit labelling approaches, I will assess the functional influence of PROG and ALLO on PrL and PrL-NAcC
ensembles for reinstatement (Aims 2-3). As I find ALLO but not PROG suppresses reinstatement in males, I will
assess steroidal effects on PrL and PrL-NAcC ensemble activity dynamics as a function of biological sex."
10844394,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Myocardial infarction (MI) initiates a dynamic cellular response almost immediately after reperfusion therapy.
Inflammation during the early stages of ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) initiates a cascade of immune cell
signaling networks which contribute to immune cell recruitment and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. The
paradoxical phenomenon of IRI results in massive cell death and is a primary determinant of adverse ventricular
remodeling. Using a novel transcriptome-wide analysis of spatiotemporal gene expression, we determined that
the RNA-binding protein, Tristetraprolin (TTP) has regulator effects on the expression of several key pro-
inflammatory cytokines and genes related to reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the role of TTP in early-
onset MI is unknown despite its well-established anti-inflammatory properties. The research described in this
proposal seeks to elucidate the cardioprotective mechanisms of TTP in early-onset MI. S100A8 and S100A9 act
as damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that are highly expressed after 3 days of IRI. Aim 1
investigates the regulatory role of TTP on S100A8/S100A9 expression and functionality. TTP knockout (TTP-
KO) and TTP overexpressing (TTP-OE) in myeloid cell lines will be used to determine the effects of TTP on
S100A8/S100A9 expression. Mutations to 6 specific AA residues has been shown to abrogate TTP binding of
mRNA molecules. TTP mutant cell lines (TTP-Δ1-6) will be generated to determine whether TTP mediates
S100A8/S100A9 signaling effects through mRNA destabilization or upstream regulation. The function of TTP
and S100A8/S100A9 are closely tied to Ca2+ availability. Therefore, Ca2+ concentration will tested as an
environmental variable. TTP has also been shown to diminish SPP1 and Cybb (NOX2) expression, inhibiting
ROS production, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction following IRI. Therefore, Aim 2 will explore the
effects of simulated (sIRI) on ROS production in TTP-KO and TTP-OE myeloid cells in vitro. Mitochondrial
function and ATP production will also be measured in cardiomyocytes upon exposure to conditioned media of
sIRI-stimulated, TTP-KO and TTP-OE myeloid cells. Lastly Aim 3 will investigate the role of myeloid-specific TTP
expression in mitigating adverse ventricular remodeling in vivo. To test this, TTP floxed mice and mice with a
136 bp floxed site upon LysMCre excision generate myeloid-specific TTP-KO and TTP-OE mice respectively.
Experimental mice will be exposed to IRI treatment by temporary LAD ligation. Echocardiography will be regularly
performed to monitor heart function and ventricular remodeling. Lastly, we will investigate the therapeutic
potential of time-dependent TTP delivery by introduction of TTP-expressing adeno-associated viral vector-9
(AAV9) or adoptive transfer with TTP-OE macrophages after 3 days of IRI. The same measurements and
assessments will be made to determine the efficacy of each treatment. The rationale behind this research is a
sound comprehension of the anti-inflammatory properties and therapeutic potential of TTP in early-onset MI.
Specifically, the effects of TTP expression on inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cardiomyopathy."
10816552,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Social perception is a fundamental feature of social communication. The ability to recognize social cues of
others is critical to forming meaningful social relationships. Deficits in social perception can lead to impaired
social coordination, resulting in loneliness and isolation that severely impacts well-being. This coordination is
evident within the dynamic social interactions that occur in social hierarchies. In social hierarchies, individuals
need to recognize social cues related to status (status signals) and use this information to determine how they
socially interact. However, our knowledge of how the brain receives and transforms status signals into
socially competent behavioral output remains limited. We have demonstrated that male and female mice
form highly linear social hierarchies where each individual has a unique rank and shows appropriate social
behavior to higher and lower ranked individuals. We have also found that the medial amygdala (MeA) and the
ventral premammillary nucleus (PmV) show differential patterns of neural activity when individuals are exposed
to dominant versus subordinate olfactory status signals. Based on these findings we hypothesize that social
signal responsive neurons exist in the MeA and PmV that processes social status information before
sending outputs to downstream hypothalamic nuclei which guide the expression of behavior.
 We will combine our innovative social hierarchy paradigm with cutting-edge molecular tools to test this
hypothesis in males and females. In Specific Aim 1, we will test if the MeA and PmV contain neuronal
subpopulations that are sensitive to status signals. Using single nucleus RNA-Seq (snRNA-Seq) we will
measure the transcriptional activation of MeA and PmV cells. Using cellular compartment analysis of temporal
activity by fluorescent in situ hybridization (catFISH) in conjunction with RNAScope we will characterize spatial
and temporal transcription patterns in the MeA and PmV in response to status signals. Using this approach, we
will be able to determine if distinct or overlapping neuronal subpopulations process dominant and subordinate
social signals. In Specific Aim 2, we will use vivo morpholinos to directly test the role of oxytocin and
vasopressin receptors in the MeA and PmV in coordinating social status perception. These receptors have a
well-established role in social behavior and are expressed in the MeA and PmV. We will selectively reduce the
translation of each receptor type, and then test how this manipulation impacts the ability of animals to engage
in social discrimination and maintain social dominance relationships. If successful, results from these studies
will establish a novel paradigm for understanding the neural processing of social perception, establish the MeA
and PmV as key brain regions in the discrimination of social signals, identify subpopulations of neurons that
respond to status cues, and determine the roles of oxytocin and vasopressin 1a receptors in these regions in
transforming social signals into contextually appropriate social behavior. This work will provide a strong
foundation for a productive research program investigating the neurobiology of social perception."

RNA molecules make an important contribution to viability and virulence of pathogenic bacteria and viruses,
participating in the most fundamental cellular processes implicated in human disease. Many RNAs contain
structured regions that are critical to function and therefore represent attractive drug targets, especially for
pathogens with high mutation rates in proteins. Intervening against these RNAs with small molecules is a
powerful way to treat infections. Although significant efforts are concentrated on identifying potent and specific
RNA binders, most of these studies are done in vitro, leaving the actual RNA-small molecule interactions in
vivo untested because a robust method to capture and identify RNA-bound small molecules in vivo does not
exist. The lack of such a method could hinder optimization of candidate RNA-binding drugs and inadvertently
delay the progress to preclinical and clinical studies. This proposal is focused on developing a facile,
inexpensive, and robust approach to capture and identify small molecules specifically binding RNAs of interest
in bacterial cells. The proposed study will use natural regulatory non-coding RNAs, riboswitches, and an in
vitro-selected RNA aptamer, capable of specific binding to cellular small molecules and antibiotics, as model
systems. Specific Aim 1 is devoted to the development of the biochemical approach for producing RNA
species in bacterial cells, capturing cognate small molecules by RNA, extracting RNA-small molecule
complexes by affinity chromatography, and identifying bound small molecules by mass spectrometry. The
methodology will be benchmarked using a panel of RNAs recognizing chemically diverse small molecules.
Specific Aim 2 will validate the approach on riboswitches whose cognate ligands are unclear or unknown. In
this aim, we anticipate to identify a cognate ligand for an “orphan” riboswitch from the human pathogen
Helicobacter pylori and characterize the riboswitch-ligand complex biochemically, biophysically, and
genetically, in vitro and in vivo. This riboswitch controls genes that are essential for bacterial virulence and thus
represents a potential drug target. The proposed approach is filling a methodological gap and will be essential
for advancing hit-to-lead optimization of the RNA-targeting small molecules and identification of cognate small
molecule binders for natural RNAs."
10839908,"Aging causes bioenergetic dysfunction in the brain, which is implicated in the pathogenesis
of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Cardiolipin (CL) is a mitochondrial signature phospholipid that is
essential for membrane structure, bioenergetics, and signaling pathways. Alterations in brain CL
content and acyl compositions are implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases,
including AD and Parkinson’s disease (PD), but the underlying causes of these defects remain
elusive. Here, we propose to investigate a novel metabolic pathway by which pathological
remodeling of CL promotes the development of AD. This pathway is mediated by the ALCAT1
enzyme, the first acyl-CoA dependent lysocardiolipin acyltransferase previously identified by us.
Our pioneering work in the field has identified ALCAT1 as a key mediator of mitochondrial
dysfunction in age-related metabolic diseases. We show that upregulation of ALCAT1 expression
by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by aging promotes mitochondrial dysfunction by
catalyzing pathological remodeling of CL with long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Enrichment of DHA renders CL highly sensitive to oxidative
damage by ROS, leading to CL peroxidation and mitochondrial dysfunction. We further show that
ablation or pharmacological inhibition of ALCAT1 successfully mitigates various age-related
metabolic diseases. Remarkably, our preliminary studies also identified a critical role of ALCAT1
in linking aging to the development of AD, which is supported by our findings that: 1) ALCAT1
deficiency significantly extends lifespan in mice; 2) Ablation of ALCAT1 restores cognitive function
and mitigates Aβ plague formation in a mouse model of AD; and 3) ALCAT1 deficiency attenuates
neuroinflammation in response to Aβ protein aggregation. These exciting findings lead us to test
the hypothesis that CL remodeling by ALCAT1 links aging to the development of AD by
promoting mitochondrial dysfunction (Fig.1), which will be tested by three Specific Aims: AIM
1 will determine whether CL remodeling by ALCAT1 links mitochondrial dysfunction to AD; AIM 2
will identify mechanisms by which ALCAT1 promotes neuroinflammation in AD, and AIM 3 will
provide proof-of-concept studies in targeting ALCAT1 for the treatment of AD."

10880541,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The inability of Entamoeba histolytica to form infectious cysts in the laboratory setting has greatly hindered
investigation of this crucial stage in the infection and disease cycle of this human pathogen that causes
amoebic dysentery in ~100 million people each year worldwide. Instead, scientists have been forced to rely on
studies with the distantly related reptile pathogen Entamoeba invadens. The long-term goal of our research
program is to determine how E. histolytica adapts to different environments it encounters during infection and
the disease process. In particular, we are interested in how E. histolytica adapts to the environment of the large
intestine in order to colonize there and spread disease by formation and dissemination of infectious cysts. We
have now established a reproducible system for encystation and excystation of E. histolytica in culture. This
major technological advance enables us to pursue an understanding of how E. histolytica senses and
responds to environmental cues that signal conversion from motile trophozoite to infectious cyst and back. As
part of our long-term goal, the overall objective of this proposal is to identify and characterize genes
responsible for initiation of encystation. The rationale for the proposed project is that understanding how E.
histolytica senses and responds to its environment through encystation will lead to a better understanding of
how this pathogen can survive and thrive as it encounters very diverse environments during different stages of
its infectious cycle. We will pursue two specific aims: (1) identify encystation initiation genes using RNAseq;
and (2) screen an overexpression library for genes involved in initiation of encystation in E. histolytica.
Candidate genes identified through these two approaches will be validated through analysis of gene silenced
and gene overexpression strains. We will evaluate these strains for their ability to encyst, excyst, and establish
standard trophozoite growth as well as their responses to other stresses such as heat, oxidative, and
nitrosative stress to determine whether any of the candidate genes play a general stress response role. As part
of the proposed research, we will optimize our encystation protocol and determine other environmental signals
that trigger more rapid encystation. The complementary RNAseq and library screening approaches should
allow us to identify genes required for the earliest stages of encystation prior to chitin cell wall formation as well
as regulatory genes. The significance of this research is that we can now begin to understand the interplay of
environmental signals that regulate encystation and how these signals are acted upon by E. histolytica. This
research will have an important impact on the field in that for the first time the processes involved in stage
conversion can be fully studied directly in the human pathogen to provide a better understanding of how E.
histolytica can thrive during colonization and continue to propagate disease through spread of infectious cysts."
10766269,"Persistent HPV infections alone are linked to ~ 4.5% of the total cancer incidence worldwide and can cause up to six different cancers. The global incidence of HPV-positive HNSCC is currently on the rise, particularly among younger adults. Despite these tumors responding more readily to treatment compared to HPV- HNSCC, a subset of patients (~10%) will fail therapy. The global health burden of HPV+ cancers and the growing incidence of HPV-related HNSCC underscore the need to expand our knowledge of HPV biology to inform the design of targeted therapeutics. A growing body of literature highlights the function of NRF2 in HPV-associated cancers. As NRF2 is implicated in numerous cancers, including ~30% of solid tumors, and their failure to respond to therapies, this pathway provides a potential therapeutic vulnerability that could be targeted in chronic HPV infection and HPV-associated cancers. To date, we have an incomplete understanding of how NRF2 is activated in HPV-infected cells. It was recently discovered that HPV E1 directly interacts with KEAP1 and we have validated this finding. This interaction phenocopies inactivating mutations in the CUL3-KEAP1-NRF2 pathway to activate NRF2 transcriptional activity. How E1 binds to KEAP1 to activate NRF2 and the conservation of this E1 function across different HPV types is currently unknown. In this proposal, we will determine the molecular mechanism by which HPV E1 activates NRF2. We hypothesize that E1 functions as a viral NRF2 mimetic to compete for KEAP1 binding. This hypothesis will be tested through 2 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will establish the molecular determinants for E1 engagement of KEAP1 and NRF2 activation. We will also assess the ability of both high-risk and low-risk HPV types to bind KEAP1 and activate NRF2. In Aim2, we will determine the structural and biophysical basis for E1-KEAP1 interactions. The ultimate goal and the overall impact of this project are to advance our understanding of HPV regulation of NRF2 signaling by the agonistic viral protein E1. This work will in turn enable us to study the E1-KEAP1-NRF2 axis as a novel vulnerability that could be targeted in chronic HPV infection and HPV-associated cancers, which currently lack targeted therapy."
10933399,"Summary: Therapy for multiple types of cancer has evolved dramatically in the last decade with the emergence
of immune modulation therapies that induce responses and prolong survival in the adjuvant and metastatic
settings. It is now apparent that these advances are only the vanguard in a rapidly evolving field. Investigators
from Yale School of Medicine have played key roles in both pre-clinical and clinical advances in immuno-
oncology. Continued advancement requires better understanding of primary and secondary resistance to
immune therapy, the biology of immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment, rational drug combinations,
studies of drug toxicities and new trial designs specific for immune therapies. Hence, there is an urgent need to
train junior investigators to conduct patient-oriented cancer immunology and immunotherapy studies to further
accelerate these advances. Our Immuno-Oncology Training Program (IOTP) addresses this critical need by
training MD or MD/PhD Scholars in clinically-relevant immuno-oncology and translational immunology. At least
five junior faculty scholars are enrolled at any given time. IOTP is distinct from existing training programs at Yale
as it is the only one to specifically focus on training of junior faculty in patient-oriented research in immuno-
oncology and immunotherapy. IOTP has been highly successful to date in developing a diverse pool of
independently funded researchers who capitalize on the wealth of expertise at our institution in immunobiology
and immunotherapy. IOTP faculty have extensive track records of mentorship and are actively pursuing research
in these areas. IOTP is supported by the Yale Cancer Center (YCC) and synergizes with the Yale Center for
Clinical Investigation, home to our CTSA grant, which provides some foundational courses. Key distinguishing
features or IOTP are didactic and practical training developed specifically for this program including courses on
basic immunology and cancer immunology, immunotherapy-specific clinical trial design, the Cancer Immunology
Forum and an individually tailored, two-year Translational Immuno-oncology research project encompassing
laboratory and/or clinical research. New for the next funding period include a course on computational
immunology, endeavors for training in mentorship and community outreach and engagement initiatives. Each
scholar has a panel of mentors. Junior faculty within five years of appointment at Yale School of Medicine are
eligible, with up to five scholars appointed at any one time, and an additional scholar will be funded by YCC. The
program is led by an Executive Committee comprised of the PI (Dr. Harriet Kluger, YCC Associate Cancer Center
Director for Education and Training), the Co-Director, Dr. Diane Krause, MD, PhD, an expert on cellular
therapies, David Stern, PhD, Chair for Curriculum Development and Roy Herbst, MD, PhD, Chief of Oncology
and Associate Cancer Center Director for Translational Research. In summary, the IOTP draws upon an area of
profound institutional strength and enables YCC to focus specifically on cross-disciplinary training of scholars in
Cancer Immunotherapy to meet the increasing need for cancer immunology experts and researchers."
10818518,"Summary
The motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) result from the degeneration of substantia nigra dopamine
(SN DA) neurons and the basal ganglia pathophysiology triggered by this loss. However, the mechanisms that
underlie the progressive degeneration of SN DA neurons, the regional network pathophysiology this causes and
PD symptoms are uncertain. A major obstacle to answering these questions is the lack of a progressive animal
model of PD amenable to the application of advanced tools for the interrogation of neurons and neural
networks. Recently, our group has developed a new mouse model of PD that overcomes this obstacle, giving us
an extraordinary opportunity. The model is predicated on the observation that loss of functional mitochondrial
complex I (MCI) – a critical element in the electron transport chain – is a common feature of the SN in PD
patients. We found that knocking out the catalytic subunit of MCI (Ndufs2) in SN DA neurons leads to
progressive, levodopa-responsive parkinsonism in mice. Importantly, in this so-called MCI-Park mouse, DA
neuron pathology begins in nigrostriatal axons and then proceeds to the somatodendritic region - reproducing
a key feature of human PD pathology. This human-like staging of pathology should provide clues not only to
PD pathogenesis, but also to the roles played by regional network pathophysiology in the emergence of motor
symptoms. By combining the expertise of the Surmeier and Bevan labs, we can rigorously characterize the
mechanisms underlying the emergence of motor deficits in the MCI-Park model through a battery of
complementary cutting-edge optical, electrophysiological, optogenetic, chemogenetic, electrochemical,
anatomical, behavioral, and transcriptomic approaches. We propose three specific aims: 1) determine the
mechanisms underlying cellular and network pathology in early-stage MCI-Park mice, where the motor
impairment is modest; 2) determine the mechanisms underlying cellular and network pathology in late-stage
MCI-Park mice that exhibit profound, levodopa-responsive motor deficits; 3) determine whether basal ganglia
pathophysiology and motor deficits in late stage MCI-Park mice can be slowed or reversed. Execution of these
aims should not only provide fundamental new insight into the mechanisms underlying the progression of PD
but could also lead to novel therapeutic strategies for restoring function in symptomatic PD patients."
10909265,"ABSTRACT
An estimated 80 million Americans are currently infected with human papilloma virus (HPV). HPV is strongly
associated with cancers for females and males. High morbidity, mortality, and economic burden are
attributable to HPV-associated cancers. Given the high infection rate of HPV in the US, vigorous prevention
efforts are needed—including timely and effective HPV vaccination for boys and girls. Before COVID-19, the
youth vaccination rate was suboptimal with about 50% youth 13-17 years having been vaccinated in contrast to
the national goal of 80%. Vaccination rates dropped dramatically during the pandemic. Evidence for game-
based health interventions is promising to facilitate knowledge acquisition and retention, and to promote
vaccination behaviors in youth. As healthcare providers often find it challenging to promote HPV education and
vaccination in clinical settings, an educational gamed-based intervention to promote HPV vaccination among
youth in clinical settings offers an innovative and scalable approach to address this disparity in children’s
healthcare. Guided by Social Cognitive Theory, we propose to (1) examine the feasibility and acceptability of a
new HPV preventive intervention, the HPV Detective video game, designed for youth and their parents; (2)
explore pre-post, intervention-related change in vaccine intent and uptake as well as change in theoretically
posited intervention mediators; and (3) assess the potential for broader intervention implementation. Using a
sequential mixed-methods, 2-group (intervention vs usual care), longitudinal design, 64 parent-youth dyads
(32/per study condition) will be recruited. Parent-youth dyads in the intervention will play HPV Detective (tablet
format) at the clinic prior to the healthcare provider visits. The control dyads will receive standard clinic
treatment. Youth ages 11-14 need to receive two doses, 6-12 months apart, for maximum protection; thus,
three weekly reminder messages will be sent 6-mos post enrollment to participants in both conditions. Data will
be collected at T0 (baseline), T1 (immediately post game for intervention only) and at T2 (7-mos post
enrollment). At 7-mo post enrollment, semi-structured interviews will be conducted with a subset of 8 parent-
youth dyads in the intervention group, representing differences in child sex, age, and game completion, to
solicit parent/youth feedback about factors that influenced their engagement in the intervention during the
clinical visit; interviews with 3 healthcare providers (1 administer, 2 providers) will be conducted to examine
factors related to intervention implementation. This study addresses the significant public health problem of
HPV-associated cancers through timely youth vaccination, aligning with the mission of NIH. If the findings are
promising, we will conduct a larger-scale RCT to examine the efficacy and effectiveness of the intervention that
is likely to impact cancer-related morbidity and mortality, and reduce economic and social costs related to
HPV-associated diseases. The findings will also extend prevention science with respect to the use of
innovative computer technology to reduce incidence of HPV-associated cancers."

This proposal aims to evaluate coronavirus assembly and egress. These late infection stages are
understudied relative to coronavirus entry replication. Additional research is necessary to
reveal how host cell machineries facilitate assembly and egress. Therefore, this proposal
specifically focuses on coronavirus membrane proteins, their interactions with host cell
components, and the relevance of these contacts to efficient virion formation and emergence
from infected cells. Guided by biochemical and protein structural data documenting interfaces
between viral peptide motifs and host coatomer and retromer complexes, we will construct
recombinant murine coronaviruses and corona virus‐like particles with alternative motifs.
Comparisons of recombinant virus infections, along with reductionist approaches assessing the
formation and subcellular transport of virus‐like particles, will reveal how coatomer and
retromer‐sorting nexins operate in controlling viral membrane protein trafficking, virus particle
formation, and particle egress pathways. By expanding the studies to human pathogenic
coronaviruses, we expect to identify commonly utilized host machineries that might be
targeted by antiviral therapeutics."

Oral health (OH) is an essential component of overall health. Early childhood caries (ECC, tooth decay), a preventable and
reversible bacterial infectious disease, is the single most prevalent chronic childhood disease in the United States (US).1-3
Poor OH and ECC disproportionally affect racial/ethnic minoritized and immigrant children4,5 from families with low
socioeconomic position (SEP). Furthermore, evidence shows that individuals who immigrate when < 20 years of age are 2-
4 times more likely to have a child with ECC than parents who are native-born or who immigrated when younger.6-10 In the
US, Hispanic/Latinx children are more likely than children of all other racial and ethnic groups to experience ECC, except
American Indians.6-8 Children’s OH behaviors and risk of ECC are influenced by the child’s and parent's sociodemographic
and acculturation level, biological, behavioral, and psychosocial variables.5-9 Parents play a central role in their children’s
OH-related behaviors.6-13 Evidence suggests that less acculturated Hispanic/Latinx parents have lower OH knowledge,
higher stress, and more barriers to accessing OH/dental care for their children than more acculturated counterparts.8,9
Brazilians are a fast-growing Latin American immigrant group in the US. Yet, little research has focused on health issues
affecting them.14,15 The US has the largest Brazilian population outside of Brazil; ~1,750,000 Brazilians live in the US.19,20
Portuguese is the official language of Brazil and a very important cultural difference between Brazilians and other Spanish-
speaking Hispanic/Latinx groups.17,18 There is a general lack of research focusing on the OH of Brazilian immigrant families
and their children living in the US. Studies conducted in Brazil suggest that low-income children and parents in this
population have low OH knowledge, poor OH status, higher prevalence of ECC, and low OH-related quality of life.17-21
Understanding Brazilian immigrant parents’ OH knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors (KAB) and their experience accessing
and utilizing OH/dental care will allow for the design of salient interventions to improve OH behaviors, OH outcomes, and
OH-related quality of life.22,23 Therefore, the specific aims for the proposed research are to: (1) use qualitative research
methods to explore Brazilian immigrant parents’ OH KAB and access and utilization of OH/dental care for their children
(Phase 1: Focus Groups); (2) translate/back translate the survey to Brazilian Portuguese and then use focus groups’ findings,
expert review, and pilot-testing to adapt the Basic Research Factors Questionnaire (BRFQ) for Brazilians in the US; (3) use
the adapted BRFQ to assess psychosocial and cultural factors associated with Brazilian immigrant parents’ OH KAB and
access and utilization of OH/dental care for their young children (Phase 3: Survey Implementation). The proposed
community-engaged research is innovative because it will be the first to focus on Brazilian immigrants, an understudied
ethnic minority and immigrant population underrepresented in OH research. Consistent with the R21’s purpose, the expected
research outcomes will provide a foundation for a larger-scale trial of an intervention to promote OH and prevent ECC
among Brazilian children in the US.22,23 This research will have a positive impact by building the science of OH research in
Brazilians in the US. Moreover, it will build additional research capacity to engage underserved, minoritized Brazilian
parents to co-design future OH promotion and ECC prevention interventions relevant to Brazilians in the US."

10861013,"Project Summary/Abstract
Emerging and endemic viral pathogens are a persistent threat to human health, the global economy, and national readiness. Viral proteins interact with host proteins to hijack host cells and replicate transmissible viral particles. Human-viral and viral-viral protein-protein interactions (PPls) have been comprehensively characterized for a limited set of viruses, identifying a ""PPI profile"" for each virus screened. However, these efforts have characterized only a small fraction of the known viruses. A complete viral-human PPI map would be an invaluable resource, enabling analyses of how often interacting viral proteins converge on common human protein targets, cellular functions, or pathways, and which of these interactions are associated with transmissibility or virulence. Combining the viral-human PPI map with human population genetic analyses will enable characterization of the molecular mechanisms underlying extant and ancient epidemics and how these PPIs drive much of human adaptation. In addition, PPI profiles of human viruses could be used to aid screening of animal reservoirs to identify potential threats before a zoonotic spillover occurs. Despite its great promise, characterization of the viral-human PPI map remains a challenge given the throughput of current viral-human PPI screening assays. Current high-throughput assays also lack a quantitative output, meaning that the emergent human-viral PPI map, or viral-viral PPI maps, would be difficult to exploit for important downstream variant scanning or drug screening applications. Here we will use a quantitative sequencing-based protein-protein interaction assay platform to screen for PPls between -24 million viral-human or viral-viral protein pairs. We will further develop this technology into a massively parallel drug screening platform and use it to screen >3 million drug-PPI combinations for small-molecule compounds that promote or antagonize a PPI. The viral-human PPI and drug-PPI maps developed here will be an invaluable resource for a broad research community. In addition, this work will establish new massively parallel and quantitative PPI and drug-PPI screening technologies that will scale with advances in gene synthesis, mutagenesis and sequencing, enabling parallel screening of tens of thousands of gene and gene variants of extant, emerging, and potentially zoonotic viruses."
10823299,"Project Summary
Breast cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed malignancy and distant spread to other organs is a
leading cause of cancer death. The treatment of metastatic breast cancer remains very challenging and requires
serial radiological monitoring to ensure that the patient is on the right treatment at the right time. This process
typically requires repeat CT or PET imaging scans which are expensive and subject patients to potential adverse
reactions, including contrast-related allergies and organ damage. The cost of radiological monitoring has
increased dramatically, at least as rapid as drug costs. Furthermore, because the radiological testing is relatively
infrequent, many stay on ineffective treatments too long. During this period the disease may progress, leaving
the patient under-treated with prolonged exposure to unnecessary toxicities and at significant cost burden,
especially with newer targeted-therapy drug classes. At the other end of the spectrum, patients with durable
response may be assigned to prolonged radiological imaging over the course of their management.
Genomic characterization of cancer has revolutionized our ability to decipher the complexities of tumor biology
and promote more precise cancer treatments. Advances in DNA sequencing have enabled the detection of
mutations in the tumor and now in tumor DNA that circulate in the blood (ctDNA). Cell-free circulating tumor
DNA has been proposed as a surrogate biological sample to define the genetic change(s) of a primary tumor
and/or metastatic disease in a cancer patient, and to serve as a biomarker for diagnosis, prognostication, and
monitoring of response to therapy. However, next generation sequencing (NGS) ctDNA panels are expensive
and are typically not reimbursed when used for serial monitoring of disease. In this application we propose a
low-cost strategy for dynamic molecular monitoring of metastatic breast cancer patients using bespoke digital
droplet PCR (ddPCR) assays constructed from a baseline NGS ctDNA test. We hypothesize that this hybrid
approach will offer a substantial lead-time over radiological detection of disease progression, allowing
for adaptive treatment changes that will reduce the time patients are exposed to ineffective treatment
and exposure to unnecessary toxicities. This cost-saving effort will substantially improve disease monitoring
in metastatic breast cancer patients, reduce toxicity associated with ineffective treatment, improve clinical trial
enrollment and serve as a viable approach to addressing cancer health inequities among underserved
populations with limited access to imaging due to the cost of these procedures."
10834260,"Brain metastasis (BM) occurs in up to 40% of patients with advanced cancers, most frequently arising from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with BM frequently suffer from debilitating symptoms, have worse response rates to modern cancer therapies and are excluded from most clinical trials, resulting in an overall poor
prognosis. While the clinical significance of BM is broadly recognized, our understanding of underlying molecular,
cellular and microenvironmental mechanisms remains rudimentary. Here, through several innovations, we overcome experimental, technical, and analytical barriers to gain unprecedented insight into cellular and microenvironmental features of human BM. In an integrative analysis of multi-modal single-cell RNA, T cell receptor and
spatial transcriptomics of primary tumors and BM from patients with NSCLC, coupled with analyses of public
data sets, we identify chromosomal instability (CIN), and CIN-induced molecular adaptations as key driver of
brain-metastatic organotropism. The brain metastatic ecosystem is enriched with a pro-tumorigenic myeloid and
dysfunctional T cell compartment. In this proposal, we aim to define the mechanistic underpinnings of these
observations. In Aim 1, we will employ a fundamentally novel analytical tool, ContactTracing, to map at a systems level all cell-cell interactions in the BM ecosystem based on multi-modal single-cell sequencing. We assembled a large validation cohort of NSCLC specimen, including primary tumors, brain and extracranial metastases, that underwent whole-exome sequencing (WES) and RNA-seq which will be deconvolved to validate pre-
dictions derived from single-cell data. Furthermore, we assembled additional NSCLC for multiplexed immunofluorescence with established antibody panels to measure the rate of CIN, CIN-adaption, and their spatial association with myeloid and lymphoid immune infiltrates. In Aim 2, through functional imaging of human and murine
models we identify CIN as a defining feature of LKB1-deficient tumors. LKB1 loss (or deleterious mutation) is a
common genomic subtype of NSCLC (along with KRAS co-mutation) that frequently metastasizes to the brain
and is characterized by treatment resistance and poor prognosis. We find that CIN results in tonic activation of
the cGAS-STING pathway to promote BM. We will dissect underlying mechanisms of CIN-induced cellular adaptations that confer brain-metastatic organotropism through modulation of the brain-metastatic niche through
cGAMP hydrolysis to adenosine, which permeabilizes the blood-brain-barrier and creates an immunosuppressive environment. For this purpose, we will use in situ niche-labeling of in vivo BM models, coupled with single-cell/spatial transcriptomics to track the evolution of brain-metastatic ecosystem, and dynamics of cell interaction
networks using ContactTracing. Upon completion of this work, we will provide mechanistic and clinical insights
into genomic and multi-cellular features of the evolving brain-metastatic ecosystem. These insights are the first
step towards development of more effective therapies of affected patients."

Resistance to the initial negative, intoxicating effects of alcohol, is a risk factor in the development of alcohol
use disorder. Another hallmark and driver of AUD is tolerance, which develops after repeat exposures. Such
repeat alcohol exposures also lead to expression changes in numerous genes, yet many transcriptional
mechanisms that enact these changes and mediate tolerance and its close relative, dependence, remain to be
elucidated. Transcriptional mechanisms encoding stable changes in gene expression include the modification
of chromatin. One of the lesser studied chromatin-modifying mechanisms is histone methylation, especially
histone demethylating enzymes (HDMs). The goal of this application is to understand the neural, molecular,
and genetic mechanisms of Kdm3 HDM-mediated regulation of initial sensitivity and of acquired tolerance to
alcohol. This is based on our published findings that Drosophila knock out of Kdm3 causes increased initial
sensitivity, and reduced tolerance to repeat ethanol exposure. First, we will determine the neurons and
conserved neurotransmitter systems that require Kdm3 for normal alcohol responses. Second, we will
determine Kdm3-dependent changes in open chromatin induced by alcohol exposure. This will include an
analysis of transcription factors that have binding sites overrepresented in regions of ethanol-induced changes
in chromatin accessibility. Third, we will investigate putative Kdm3-target genes by asking which of them
mediate Kdm3’s effects on alcohol-induced behavior. The premise for each of our aims is supported by
extensive published and preliminary data. Together, the proposed experiments will illuminate mechanisms of
Kdm3-mediated chromatin modifications and gene regulation that mediate alcohol sensitivity and tolerance.
The proposed experiments are highly responsive to the NIAAA Notice of Special Interest NOT-AA-21-029
“Genetics of Alcohol Sensitivity and Tolerance” and will provide an “enhanced understanding of genetic,
genomic, and epigenetic factors contributing to biological processes for individual variation in sensitivity and
the development of tolerance” (NOT-AA-21-029)."
10651551,"Cerebral palsy (CP) encompasses a group of disorders of movement and posture, attributed to non-progressive disturbances affecting the developing brain. Movement and tone disorders in children and young adults with CP are a great source of disability. CP is the most common cause of acquired dystonia in childhood, but its management is problematic, as medications and neurotoxin denervation only provide modest benefit. Deep brain stimulation of basal ganglia or thalamic targets has a major role in the treatment of isolated dystonias, but its efficacy in dystonic CP (DCP) is much lower. Lower efficacy may be due to structural damage in basal ganglia and motor thalamus, lack of improvement of comorbid choreoathetosis and spasticity, and an increased risk of hardware complications in this population. We propose an alternative brain target for DBS in DCP, the cerebellum, leveraging recent developments in dystonia neurophysiology, brain stimulation hardware and neuroimaging. The cerebellum is an attractive target for DBS in DCP since it is frequently spared from hypoxic ischemic damage, it has a prominent role in contemporary network models of dystonia, and small studies have shown promise of cerebellar stimulation in improving spasticity and CP-related movement disorders. Ten children and young adults with CP and disabling movement disorders and spasticity will undergo bilateral DBS in dorsal (motor) dentate nucleus, with the most distal contact in superior cerebellar peduncle. We will implant Medtronic PerceptTM, an FDA-approved “bidirectional” neurostimulator that can sense and store brain activity as well as simultaneously deliver DBS therapy. Recent improvements in hardware size and brain lead fixation address the prior high complication rate reported for pediatric DBS, and provide “directional” leads for more targeted stimulation. We will characterize abnormal patterns of cerebellar oscillatory activity as measured by local field potentials (LFP) related to clinical assessments and wearable monitors, and their relation to stimulation (Aim 1). Pre- and 12-month postoperative volumetric structural and functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging will be used to identify candidate imaging markers of baseline disease severity and response to DBS (Aim 2). In Aim 3, we will test the efficacy of cerebellar stimulation for improving quality of life as well as motor outcomes as assessed by clinical assessments and objective kinematic metrics. We will use a N-of-1 clinical trial design to mitigate the variability in clinical features in this population. Our goal is to develop a neuromodulation therapy that produces meaningful changes in function and well-being of people with CP, obtain a mechanistic understanding of the underlying brain network disorder, and identify physiological and imaging-based predictors of outcome useful in planning further studies."

particularly physician-scientists, are needed to enable rigorous and creative advances in
biomedical research that will enhance our understanding of disease pathogenesis and suggest
strategies to improve the outcome of patients with immune disorders. Our proposal engages 21
mentors at all career levels and is built around 4 areas of scientific excellence in immunology: 1)
Autoimmunity; 2) Neuroimmune inflammation; 3) Tissue injury, inflammation and innate
immunity and 4) Tumor immunology. In each area, our faculty investigate disease mechanisms
using specimens from well-established clinical cohorts and biorepositories and perform human-
relevant studies that range from focused studies in model organisms to clinical trials of novel
therapies. Specific aims are:
1. To recruit trainees who are diverse with respect to demographics, experience and interests;
2. To provide a multi-disciplinary “toolbox” curriculum needed for a successful career in human
and translational investigation;
3. To teach trainees how to conduct creative, rigorous and ethical independent research that is
driven by observations in human disease and that uses state of the art technologies to generate
and test new hypotheses related to immune mediated diseases;
4. To engage faculty, students and our advisory committee in an ongoing self-evaluation
process that will foster the continued growth and improvement of our training program;
5. To mentor and create a new generation of translational immunologists who will collaboratively
tackle research problems linked to improving clinical outcomes of patients with immune-

a broad understanding of immunology, modern technologies and the resilience to persevere."
10873762,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The past decade of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) has seen thousands of complex traits and
diseases studied and identified thousands of reproducibly associated genetic variants. GWAS has helped
characterize the complexity of common genetic architectures and shed light on the role of genetics in disease
risk. A large body of works have demonstrated that risks of complex traits are highly enriched in functional regions
of the genome, which indicates that risk is mediated through perturbed regulatory action on relevant susceptibility
genes. Similarly, multiple recent works have found that disease risks are shaped by forces of natural selection,
which kept the frequencies of deleterious alleles low in the population. Together, the functional mechanisms and
their interplay with natural selection can be coupled under a general mechanism we refer to as the evolutionary
architecture. Current frameworks to infer the evolutionary architecture for common complex diseases are only
applicable to relatively homogenous populations, such as individuals of European ancestry. Several recent works
have demonstrated that integrating multi-ethnic GWAS data substantially improves statistical power to identify
causal factors underlying complex traits and diseases due to the increased heterogeneity in allele frequencies.
Current approaches evolutionary architecture are unable to appropriately model the heterogeneity across
populations with respect to allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium. Similarly, the resolution of these
methods is currently limited to complex diseases and phenotypes, whose inferred architectures, while
informative, fail to describe regulatory network mechanisms that mediate risk. Methods capable of analyzing
many molecular phenotypes simultaneously have the potential to identify shared architectures, and pinpoint core
genes relevant for disease risk. Lastly, several works have shown that integrating functional information with
GWAS substantially improves polygenic risk prediction. Together, these issues and opportunities highlight the
need for new computational approaches that can scale to multiple populations and large-scale molecular
phenotype catalogues while accounting for underlying heterogeneity and shared signals. Here, we propose novel
approaches to integrate GWAS data from multiple, geographically diverse, populations and phenotypes to
characterize the population-specific and shared evolutionary architectures. Importantly, our approaches run
directly on summary data, which enables immediate large-scale analysis. We propose to apply our novel
approaches to large-scale multi-ethnic GWAS data. Together, our work will systematically characterize
evolutionary architectures for complex diseases and molecular phenotypes and populations in a robust, open,
and reproducible approach."
10865054,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite the well-established benefits of germline genetic testing (gGT) for cancer patients including informing
treatment (targeted therapies, appropriate surgery) and family members (cascade testing), there has been
inconsistent integration of gGT into oncology workflows leading to significant gaps in care. Less labor-
intensive, streamlined service delivery strategies may improve access to testing for and reduce the burden on
sick cancer patients particularly in less resource-rich environments. This proposal is directly responsive to
RFA-HG-20-048 because it measures the efficacy and acceptability of novel genetic counseling practices
aimed at modernizing genetics care. The overall objectives in this application are to refine our pretest cancer
genetics Video Education and Result-Dependent dIsclosure (VERDI) intervention, compare patient-centered
outcomes of VERDI to standard counseling, elucidate required resources / costs and delineate the receptivity
and readiness for implementation of VERDI by genetic counselors (GCs). The rationale for the proposed
research is that alternative models must be informed by rigorous evaluation of effects on patients and GCs.
These goals will be accomplished by pursuing three specific aims: (i) refine and adapt VERDI to ensure
acceptability among diverse cancer patients (ii) conduct a randomized trial of VERDI vs standard genetic
counseling care through two cancer centers and their community partners and compare patient-centered
outcomes and (iii) evaluate the impact of the VERDI paradigm on GCs and costs to inform practice. In Aims 1
and 2, the studies will include patients of diverse backgrounds in several settings with cancers for which gGT is
standard and those for which it is less routine. Qualitative interviews of patients will inform the refinement of
VERDI, followed by a randomized trial of VERDI vs standard of care genetic counseling with measurement of
the following patient-centered outcomes: receipt of intervention, testing uptake, satisfaction, psychosocial
impact, knowledge and family communication. Aim 3 will use a mixed-methods analysis through semi-
structured qualitative interviews followed by a national survey of GCs to elucidate facilitators and barriers to
widespread implementation. Under this aim, a cost analysis evaluating cost-per-patient tested will be
performed using data collected during the randomized trial. The research proposed in this application is
innovative because it uses simple, adaptable technology combined with a pragmatic, patient-centered
approach informed by the needs of diverse patients to standardize processes. Robust outcomes of all
stakeholders, especially GCs whose role would change the most are measured. The proposed research is
significant because it is expected to provide patient, provider and systems level data to inform ways to expand
access to gGT and counseling for ill patients safely and effectively. Ultimately, this knowledge will foster
scalable approaches to genetic and genomics care for a variety of medical conditions, address the evolving
role of GCs while promoting improved access and delivering on the promise of personalized care."

 Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma and the most common
hematologic malignancy. DLBCL exhibits significant molecular and clinical heterogeneity, yet all patients are
treated with standard chemoimmunotherapy. As such, there is a strong clinical need to identify biomarkers of
drug response and novel therapies to improve patient outcomes. BCL10 mutations are prevalent among DLBCL
subtypes and recurrent mutations frequently truncate the BCL10 protein’s regulatory C-terminus. BCL10 is a
core component of the CARD11 (CARMA1)-BCL10-MALT1 complex, which activates downstream oncogenic
pathways like JNK and NF-kB in DLBCL; however, the mechanisms by which BCL10 mutations promote
lymphomagenesis in DLBCL are poorly understood. Recent results implicate BCL10 mutations in the induction
of NF-kB signaling and MALT1 protease activity and Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase inhibitor (BTKi) resistance. The
overall objective is to understand the role of BCL10 mutations in DLBCL, to determine mechanisms of drug
resistance and to identify alternative treatment strategies for patients with these mutations. The central
hypothesis that BCL10 mutations are activating in nature, driving lymphomagenesis and resistance to BTKis,
will be tested through the following specific aims: 1) Understand the role of BCL10 mutations in
lymphomagenesis using genetically accurate in vivo models, and 2) Identify alternative therapeutic
targets to overcome drug resistance mediated by BCL10 mutations. Aim 1 will characterize survival and
tumor incidence of a novel murine model generated in the lab containing an inducible BCL10 truncation mutation
expressed on the ROSA26 locus of C57BL/6J mice. The model mimics human disease through B-cell-specific
activation of BCL10 mutations using Cre-recombination and will also be crossed with mice overexpressing BCL6,
which occurs in context with BCL10 mutations. Aim 2 will identify compounds to attack BCL10 mutated cells
alone or in combination with BTKis by implementing small molecule synergy screens that target the BCR, NF-
kB and parallel signaling pathways. The expected outcome is the creation of genetically accurate in vivo models
of BCL10 mutations to understand their lymphomagenic potential, to define BCL10 as a biomarker of BTKi
resistance, and to identify novel, targetable dependencies induced by BCL10 mutations. The proposed research
is significant because it will uncover mechanisms of lymphomagenesis, identify biomarkers to guide clinical
decision-making in DLBCL and discover potential drug targets to overcome resistance or synergize with existing
therapies. Also, these studies are innovative because the described mouse model will be the first to characterize
BCL10 mutations in vivo and will provide a novel context to study lymphomagenesis and drug resistance driven
by BCL10 mutations. Overall, this research will have positive impacts as identifying BCL10 as a biomarker for
response to therapy and determining a therapeutic strategy for patients with BCL10 mutations will guide
treatment options and improve outcomes in DLBCL patients."

The transforming human gammaherpesviruses Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi’s sarcoma-
associated herpesvirus (KSHV) are linked to the development of multiple types of malignancies,
including a wide range of germinal center (GC)-derived B cell lymphomas. These viruses establish
lifelong latent infections in B cells by infecting naïve B cells and driving those cells, independent
of antigen, to utilize GC reactions to proliferate and differentiate into resting memory B cells. Thus,
the transit of infected B cells through the GC is critical to gammaherpesvirus biology. Despite this,
the specific mechanisms by which gammaherpesviruses manipulate GC reactions and contribute
to GC-derived B cell lymphomas are not fully understood. Virus-encoded microRNAs (miRNAs)
are employed by gammaherpesviruses to manipulate infected cells. Importantly though, the
specific in vivo functions and biological relevance of these miRNAs are almost completely
unknown due to the strict species specificity of the human viruses. Murine gammaherpesvirus 68
(MHV68, MuHV-4) is genetically and pathogenically related to EBV and KSHV, and causes B cell
lymphomas with features of human gammaherpesvirus malignancies. We have recently
demonstrated that MHV68 miRNA miR-7-5p repression of the multifunctional host protein EWSR1
(Ewing sarcoma breakpoint protein 1) promotes latent infection of GC B cells. Notably though,
the roles of EWSR1 in both gammaherpesvirus infection and GC B cell biology are completely
unknown. In work here, we will test the hypothesis that EWSR1 repression is critical for
proliferative expansion of germinal center B cells, define the molecular mechanism by which
EWSR1 repression contributes to germinal center B cell expansion, and define the contribution
of miR-7-5p-mediated EWSR1 repression to B cell lymphomagenesis."
10873756,"Project Summary/Abstract. Continuing support of our training grant, ‘Early Stage Training in the
Neurosciences’ (ESTN), which was founded at the University of Michigan (UM) in 2001, is requested. The goal
of this grant, which is a centerpiece of the Neuroscience Graduate Program (NGP), is to provide a cadre of
exceptional predoctoral students with broad training in neuroscience. This will prepare them for careers that will
help to meet the nation’s basic science and biomedical research needs. A number of exciting new changes have
occurred in the ESTN/NGP including a new leadership team, new state-of-the-art facilities and resources, a
dynamic new cohort of young neuroscience faculty, the Kavli Scholars, and a revised curriculum and examination
format to better prepare our students. To be eligible for ESTN support, students must be admitted to the NGP,
the most selective biomedical science program at UM, through either direct admit or the PIBS admission
umbrella. In the first year, students complete a broad-based neuroscience curriculum that includes: neuroscience
“bootcamp”, principles of neuroscience, human neuroanatomy, statistics, research responsibility and ethics, and
neuroscience research seminar, in addition to performing laboratory research rotations. At the end of the year,
students take their Qualifying Exam. In their second year, students take electives, give oral presentations in the
Neuroscience seminar course, complete an NRSA grant and work on their doctoral research. The ESTN consists
of 85 faculty representing 19 departments in 5 schools or colleges. The wide academic distribution, strong
research funding and high-level of peer recognition of the ESTN faculty excellently matches this application’s
focus on broad early stage neuroscience training. Trainees are exposed to a broad range of research areas
including: Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience; Developmental Neuroscience; Sensory Neuroscience;
Cognitive Neuroscience; Behavioral and Systems Neuroscience; Computational Neuroscience; and Clinical and
Translational Neuroscience. Upon completion of training, our graduates are poised to tackle a host of basic
neuroscience and/or public health issues ranging from the molecular basis of neurodegenerative disorders to
brain circuit abnormalities in psychiatric disease. The NGP at University of Michigan has a history of recruiting
and training students from underrepresented groups, yet strives to continue to increase the diversity of its
trainees. Our accomplishments and a detailed plan for continuing to recruit, retain and develop successful
underrepresented Ph.D. trainees in neuroscience research are highlighted. We also present detailed plans for
mentoring, professional development, evaluation of the program, and for instruction in quantitative methods and
the responsible conduct of research. Taken together, the Michigan ESTN provides outstanding training to future
neuroscientists within the setting of a major research university."
10886840,"This is a competing renewal of a five-year Institutional NRSA application for the support of predoctoral
students in the interdepartmental Graduate Program in Neuroscience at Emory University. A fundamental
strength of this program is the broad interdisciplinary training provided in a wide spectrum of neurobiological
issues spanning several basic and clinical neuroscience-related disciplines. Because of the significant growth
in highly qualified applicants to this program during the past funding period and the high success rate of
current trainees in building up an outstanding record of peer-reviewed publications and successfully
competing for external funds at the national level (among the top 4 neuroscience programs for NRSAs at the
national level), we seek support for 10 students per year in this renewal (ie 3 more than the current funding
state). A total of 81 PhD students (+ 17 new recruits for fall 2020) are enrolled in this program, which has
consistently attracted a large and very high quality applicant pool from all over US and a significant number
of international applicants with outstanding academic credentials. The program has been extremely
successful in enrolling outstanding underrepresented minority (URM) students during the past 5 years, and
in attracting a larger pool of highly qualified URM to apply. Over 25% of the current pool of students in the
program and trainees supported by this training grant are from URM ethnic groups, a 65% increase from the
previous renewal application. Over 90% of trainees who have been supported by this training grant for the
past ten years have successfully developed research-related careers. The attrition rate of the program has
been below 10% for the past ten years. An Executive Committee representing the 130 (94 on this grant)
faculty from 22 departments and the Yerkes National Primate Research Center administers the program. This
committee is headed by the Director, who oversees all aspects of program operation, two Directors of
Graduate Studies, who monitor student progress, and the Director of Admissions, who is in charge of
recruitment of new students in the program. Students in the program receive a broad curriculum of molecular,
cellular and systems neuroscience courses in their first two years. A required hypothesis design and grant
writing course helps students prepare their thesis proposal (with oral defense) in the form of an NRSA
predoctoral fellowship application. Training in quantitative literacy, scientific rigor and reproducibility has been
integrated in these core courses. Trainees are also required to participate in 3 laboratory rotations before they
pick their advisor (usually at the beginning of year 2). A wide variety of elective courses ranging from Basic
Mechanisms of Neurological Diseases, Brain imaging, Computational Neuroscience and Neuropharmacology
are available to advanced trainees. Finally, students actively participate in various seminar series and receive
significant training in teaching, neuroethics and scholar integrity. The quality of the Neuroscience program
and the progress made under this training grant are evaluated by an external advisory board every 2-3 years."

Early initiation of alcohol use (EIAU) during adolescence is a key contributor to development of lifetime alcohol
(AUD) and/or substance use disorders (SUDs). A critical component for preventing and intervening EIAU is early
detection using behavioral or cognitive risk precursors; and understanding better their underlying neural
substrates before the onset of substance use may aid in developing more effective and targeted interventions.
Prior studies suggest sleep disturbance, internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors, and cognitive
performance are potential risk precursors of EIAU. However, mixed or inconsistent findings have been reported
which may reflect study design and methodological issues, and the neural substrates subserving co-
development of these frequently occurring problems remain to be identified. In this application, we propose to
use data from the longitudinal Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study to investigate the neural
substrates that are predictive of EIAU and its risk precursors. A number of advanced analytical approaches will
be used to extract novel features at both structural and functional levels. For example, the Joint and Individual
Variance Explained (JIVE) method will be used to extract biologically meaningful cortical-subcortical covariation
patterns. Existing literature and our preliminary results led us to hypothesize that the cortical-subcortical
covariation pattern including brainstem, thalamus, prefrontal cortex and other regions underlies the co-
development of sleep, internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors, and poor cognitive function from late
childhood to mid-adolescence. Specifically, this project has three complementary aims. Aim 1 will assess the
relationships between the baseline cortical-subcortical covariation patterns and EIAU and its four risk precursors
in mid-adolescence. Aim 2 will characterize the developmental trajectory of cortical-subcortical covariation
pattern and assess its dynamic relationship with the four risk precursors longitudinally. Aim 3 will explore whether
functional connectivity predicts sleep disturbance, cognitive performance, behavioral problems, and/or age at
first alcohol use. Results from this application will significantly advance the field of addiction neuroscience."

The purpose of this K23 Career Development Award is to support the applicant in acquiring the knowledge and
skills needed for an independent research career as an implementation scientist who evaluates strategies that
enhance the impact of early intervention for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) when delivered in
diverse service systems. It will achieve this by complementing the candidate’s background in community
engaged research with expert mentorship in intervention fidelity and adaptation, clinical decision making,
clinical trial design and evaluation, and [autism service inequities among underrepresented children].
Persistent disparities accessing early intervention compromise the quality of life of autistic children and their
families and can be addressed by translating evidence-based treatments, such parent-mediated interventions
(PMIs), into service systems that are an access point to care for young children. Although translation efforts
are under way, high attrition has compromised the impact of PMIs when delivered win marginalized
communities. This gap may reflect an emphasis on implementing PMIs in a manner that maintains fidelity while
also at times conflicting with the complex needs of underrepresented families that inevitably arise in PMI. This
K23 proposal will address this gap by evaluating co-production, or the balance between fidelity and family-
centered care, within an evidence-based PMI for ASD, Project ImPACT, delivered in a state-funded Early
Intervention system. Mixed-methods findings from the first research aim will be used by key stakeholders to
develop and evaluate an implementation strategy that targets ideal co-production to enhance caregiver
engagement within Project ImPACT. Under the primary mentorship of Lawrence Scahill, Ph.D., an expert in
clinical trials for ASD, and co-mentorship from Aubyn Stahmer, Ph.D., Chris Sheldrick, Ph.D., [and Jennifer
Singh, PhD.], the applicant will pursue training in: 1) early intervention fidelity and adaptation; 2) clinical and
shared decision making; 3) the design and execution of clinical trials; and [4) cultural diversity and systemic
inequities]. Training in these areas will enhance the applicant’s pursuit of the following research aims: 1)
Evaluate co-production within Project ImPACT; 2) Develop an implementation strategy that targets ideal co-
production within Project ImPACT by teaching the balance of fidelity and family-centered care; and 3) Conduct
a pilot randomized trial to assess the feasibility of evaluating Project ImPACT training when paired with the co-
production implementation strategy (Project ImPACT-C) in comparison to Project ImPACT training as usual
(Project ImPACT-TAU). This proposal is aligned with NIMH’s strategic objective [4.3a to adapt evidence-based
intervention to account for moderators, including social determinants of health, that impact effectiveness
among underrepresented groups]. Further, the strong training and research plans embedded within this K23
proposal will effectively position the applicant for an independent research career evaluating strategies that
enhance the service outcomes of ASD interventions when implemented within diverse service systems."

Obesity is a pandemic affecting 40% of the population that increases the risk of serious metabolic diseases
including type 2 diabetes and severe forms of SARS-CoV2 infection. Obesity reduces insulin sensitivity and
dysregulates glucose homeostasis sustaining high blood glucose levels and the development of type 2 diabetes.
Activation of brown adipocytes (BAs) is a promising approach to treat obesity and associated diseases. Brown
adipocytes rely on an extensive network of mitochondria that increases energy expenditure and maintains
glucose homeostasis through glucose, amino acid, and fatty acid oxidation. During fat-induced stress,
mitochondrial-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) communication sustains cellular function in BAs. However, the
mechanisms by which mitochondrial-ER communication shapes cellular adaptation during obesity are poorly
understood. Therefore, studying these pathways will provide new therapeutical approaches to target obesity.
The main goal of this application is to study the mechanisms of mitochondrial-ER communication that ensure
mitochondrial function and cellular homeostasis during diet-induced stress. We have described that in BAs
mitochondrial-ER communication promotes thermogenesis during cold stimulation through the ER-resident
kinase PERK. To follow up this work, in Aim 1, the effects of long-term high fat diet (HFD) will be studied in
UCP1-Cre PERK-/- mice exposed to different dietary and bioenergetic conditions. Our preliminary information
suggests that PERK may be signaling to the chaperone PPID to control mitochondrial protein import. In Aim 2,
structural approaches using Cryogenic Electron Microscopy (CryoEM) will be used to explore the molecular
interactions that control and maintain mitochondrial functions in BAs including mitochondrial protein import,
focusing on PPID-dependent pathway, and cellular respiration during dietary and thermal stress. Finally, in Aim
3 the role of PPID in physiology and cellular functions will be studied in mice exposed to diet and thermal stress.
While Aims 1 and part of 2 will be completed during the training stage, part of Aim 2 and the entire Aim 3 will be
conducted during the independent phase of the award.
The extensive training in different fields proposed in this application including physiology and cellular and
structural biology will provide the tools to become an independent researcher and study the mechanisms of inter-
organalle communication that regulate mitochondrial biogenesis and cellular metabolism. This training will be
received in the vibrant scientific communities of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School. This
environment will expose me to the collaborations and discussions necessary for career development and future
opportunities. Dr. Puigserver mentorship will be supportive to establish those connections and actively guide me
in talk and manuscript preparation, student mentorship, experimental design, and career development. Together,
the research and career development plans proposed in this application will strengthen my skills and
competitiveness to become an independent researcher at a major institution."
10799655,"Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) and Kallmann syndrome (KS) are rare congenital forms of
infertility that prevent patients from entering puberty and lead to infertility in their adulthood, thus causing
significant burden to affected children both physically and psychologically. The lack of gonadotrophin-releasing
hormone (GnRH), the hormone secreted by GnRH neurons, is the cause of IHH and KS. Despite previous efforts
to identify causal variants in IHH/KS through pedigree analyses and studies to explore the functional
dysregulation in GnRH neurons, the genetic etiology of IHH/KS remains largely unexplained. To address this
challenge, I will (1) define a complete spectrum of genomic variants, ranging from single nucleotide variants
(SNVs) to large structural variation (SV), from whole genome sequencing (WGS) of the largest IHH/KS cohort
assembled worldwide, and perform joint association of coding and non-coding variants using already established
statistical methods to identify risk genes and regulatory elements; (2) examine the impact of loss of function
(LoF) mutations of infertility associated genes on transcriptome dysregulation in GnRH neurons; and (3) examine
the effect of genomic variants in a broader range of individuals affected by constitutional delayed puberty (CDP).
The planned research incorporates statistical modeling of genomic variants in trio genomes and interpretation of
transcriptome dysregulation from RNA sequences in GnRH neurons to gain insights into the genetic etiology of
rare congenital infertility. To ensure success of the project, Dr. Michael Talkowski, Director of the Center for
Genomic Medicine (CGM) at Mass General Hospital (MGH), Harvard Medical School (HMS) and the Broad
Institute, will serve as the primary mentor. Drs. Stephanie Seminara, reproductive endocrinologist and Professor
of Medicine at MGH and HMS, and Harrison Brand, Assistant Professor and Lead of the Broad SV Team, will
provide additional guidance as co-mentors. Drs. Talkowski and Seminara are world leaders in computational
genetics and reproductive biology, and Dr. Brand has led numerous studies interpreting SVs in disease genomes
and recently successfully transitioned to an independent research faculty at MGH and HMS through a K99/R00
award. In addition to their complementary leadership, a team of advisory committee members at various career
stages will provide scientific feedback and career development advice throughout the project. The abundance of
resources, tools, and scientific and clinical expertise accessible through the CGM, MGH, and the Broad Institute
form a highly collaborative environment ideally positioned to support my transition to independence.
The research will extend my expertise to include cutting-edge techniques and provide the opportunity to learn
about phenotypes associated with congenital and constitutional infertility disorders, how to apply statistical
methods to identify causal genomic loci, and how to interpret deviations in transcriptome activity. With these
skills, I will be able to functionally characterize genetic variation affecting reproductive disorders and be well-
positioned to launch my own high-performing and innovative independent research program."

Optimal health for children with medical complexity (CMC) often depends on exposure to pediatric
polypharmacy (≥5 concurrent medications). Medication-related problems (MRPs), like inappropriate therapy,
undertreated symptoms, or adverse drug events, can lead to emergency visits or hospitalizations. Yet, during
routine clinical care for CMC, polypharmacy is infrequently assessed and rarely managed comprehensively. To
improve medication-related patient outcomes, safety, and value, a new approach is needed to manage
polypharmacy in the priority population of CMC. Pharmacist-led medication therapy management (MTM) is a
proven and effective tool for managing adult and geriatric polypharmacy. Our scientific premise is that a
structured pharmacist-led Pediatric Medication Therapy Management (pMTM) intervention will improve the
proactive management of polypharmacy by directly addressing major gaps in current practice. The
implementation of pMTM to address pediatric MRPs thus represents innovation based on an established
foundation. We propose a hybrid type 2 randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a pMTM intervention. This 5-year
study compares the effectiveness of a pMTM intervention to usual care for reducing the primary outcome of
MRPs, as well as the secondary outcomes of symptom burdens and acute healthcare utilization. In Aim 1, we
use a hybrid type 2 RCT to quantitatively measure reach and effectiveness of the pMTM intervention. We will
recruit CMC with polypharmacy and their parents within an academic center’s outpatient complex care
program that serves >5600 CMC annually. In Aim 2, we will quantitatively and qualitatively examine important
patient and parent characteristics that modify the effectiveness of the pMTM intervention. In Aim 3, we will
assess adoption, implementation, and potential for maintenance of the pMTM intervention by healthcare
providers, including program replication costs. The University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus provides
a unique research environment enabling the conduct of pediatric polypharmacy research, supported by
collaborative research partnerships between the Adult and Child Center for Health Outcomes Research and
Delivery Science (ACCORDS), the Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, and the
Children’s Hospital Colorado Special Care Clinic for children with medical complexity. Dr. James Feinstein, an
expert in pediatric complex care and polypharmacy research, will lead an experienced team of co-investigators
including, Dr. Allison Kempe (pragmatic trials and implementation science), Dr. Chris Feudtner (health services
and complex care research), Dr. Lucas Orth (pediatric pharmacy), Dr. John Rice (biostatistics and longitudinal
methods), Dr. Megan Morris (qualitative research), and Dr. Mark Gritz (economic analysis) to complete the
proposed research. If pMTM is proven effective, it could be rapidly disseminated nationally as a model for
pharmacist integration into outpatient complex care programs and it could have enormous impact on the public
health of CMC by preventing medication-related safety issues, attendant morbidity, and associated costs."

Language and communication impairments (aphasia) are the defining features of the clinical neurodegenerative
dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA), which can be caused by Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or
frontotemporal lobar degeneration. The devastation of communication negatively impacts quality of life for
persons living with PPA and their care partners. Communication difficulties in PPA can also reduce life-space
mobility including shrinking social interactions and lowering participation in community activities.
Nonpharmacological interventions, including speech-language and psychosocial intervention, may offer
significant benefit to the quality of life for persons with PPA and their care partners, but have historically lacked
efficacy evidence as well as guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. We have been changing this
landscape, through the development of the Communication Bridge (CB) intervention with strategically staged,
rigorous clinical trials that are on a path towards implementation. The CB1 trial established feasibility of delivering
our intervention at a global scale via telepractice and demonstrated gains in functional communication outcomes
that were maintained 6-months post baseline. Next, the CB2 trial provided the first rigorous Phase 2a, Stage II,
superiority, randomized controlled trial (RCT) of speech-language intervention in PPA. CB2 interim analysis
conditional power results suggest a high probability of trial success (>80%) but also identified a need for greater
psychosocial education and counseling. Thus, the current application proposes the CB3 trial designed to
optimize the intervention by testing whether the addition of psychosocial education and counselling
(PEC) to speech-language intervention (Experimental arm) is superior to an active Control intervention.
The RCT will be complemented by Aim 1a, which will maximize pragmatic trial readiness following the Readiness
Assessment for Pragmatic Trials (RAPT) tool; and Aim 2, which will assess functional outcomes with novel
wearable sensors to objectively measure life participation using a ‘Life-Space Mobility’ framework. Trial
outcomes will inform future pragmatic trial design. The translational potential is high since the delivery model
and primary outcomes are aligned with current clinical practice. In the absence of a definitive cure for AD and
related neurodegenerative diseases, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals
maximize their quality of life, and this project will help fulfill this need."
10831536,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Although the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is complex and multifactorial, vascular comorbidities
and cerebrovascular insufficiency occur in almost two-thirds of AD patients. However, how cerebrovascular
insufficiency interacts with and contributes to AD remains poorly understood. Recently, the brain vasculome (i.e.
transcriptome profiles of cerebral endothelial cells and pericytes) has been proposed as a conceptual
framework to investigate vascular mechanisms in CNS diseases. In response to RFA-AG-23-014 (Mechanisms
of Brain Hypoperfusion in AD/ADRD), we propose to test the hypothesis that cerebrovascular insufficiency
perturbs the AD brain vasculome, eventually leading to cognitive impairment.
The normal brain compensates for hypoperfusion by inducing endogenous vascular remodeling and
angiogenesis. The presence of AD interferes with endogenous angiogenesis and vascular recovery in response
to hypoperfusion, and this exacerbates AD progression and worsens the AD brain vasculome. Because
circadian rhythms and circadian genes are known to regulate angiogenesis, we further hypothesize that AD
disrupts circadian homeostasis in the brain vasculome, thus interfering with the endogenous angiogenic
response to hypoperfusion.
The importance of investigating these interactions between AD, vascular responses, and circadian rhythms is
emphasized by our pilot data. For example, we show a greater difference in transcriptome profiles of cerebral
endothelial cells and pericytes of wild-type vs AD mice when tested during the active (awake) phase compared
to the inactive (sleep) phase. For testing our hypotheses, we propose three integrated aims. Aim 1 will show
that AD brains exhibit a lower capacity of compensatory angiogenesis in response to hypoperfusion, and Aim 2
will show that circadian rhythms are disrupted in AD brains and that disrupted circadian rhythms suppress
angiogenic response. And finally, Aim 3 will examine whether re-normalizing circadian rhythms improves the
brain vasculome and promotes angiogenesis after hypoperfusion in AD mice.
Whether and how AD brains lose compensatory angiogenesis capacity after cerebral hypoperfusion is unknown.
Therefore, we have designed a multi-disciplinary multi-lab project to fill this gap of knowledge by examining how
perturbations in circadian rhythms disrupt the brain vasculome and worsen hypoperfusion in AD."

The ability of cancer cells to evade immunosurveillance is one of the hallmarks of cancer. Understanding the
mechanisms by which T, B and NK cells detect and attack cancer cells and developing approaches to break
tumor immune tolerance have revolutionized the treatment of various human cancers. Macrophages are the
major components of primary tumors and metastatic sites, and emerging studies have demonstrated that the
escape from macrophage immunosurveillance is a critical immune evasion mechanism of cancer cells. Recent
paradigm-shifting discoveries have begun to reveal that inducing macrophage-mediated cancer cell recognition
and phagocytosis, a process termed programmed cell removal (PrCR), is crucial to tumor surveillance and
elimination. A “don’t eat me” signal CD47 has been identified to be upregulated on a variety of malignant
hematopoietic and solid tumor cells, and blockade of CD47 enables the susceptibility of cancer cells to PrCR.
Recent progress in clinical trials demonstrated significant therapeutic potential of restoring PrCR as a promising
cancer immunotherapy. While inducing PrCR holds considerable promise in treating multiple types of cancers,
its underlying mechanisms remain unclear, which have hindered the development of PrCR-based therapy to
achieve its maximal efficacy. The overall objective of this research proposal is to develop strategies to promote
macrophage-mediated cancer surveillance and elimination by breaking macrophage tolerance, and to determine
the efficacy and mechanisms of such strategies in PrCR-based cancer immunotherapy. The proposed studies
focus on identifying and engaging adjuvants to augment the anticancer efficacy of PrCR-based therapy, and
dissecting the molecular mechanisms of PrCR activation and macrophage-cancer cell interaction. Aim1 is to
examine the roles of PrCR adjuvants in enhancing the efficacy of CD47-blocking antibodies, determine to what
extent the adjuvants break macrophage immune tolerance to augment PrCR-based therapy, and decipher the
composition and phenotype of tumor-associated macrophages upon the treatment of the adjuvants, with in vitro
and in vivo preclinical cancer models. Aim2 is focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms of the
adjuvants in augmenting the efficacy of PrCR-based therapy, by identifying the molecular machinery involved in
cancer cell phagocytosis and the function and regulation of PrCR immune checkpoints in mediating macrophage-
cancer cell interaction. A combination of in vitro and in vivo cell biological, biochemical, bioinformatic, and
immunological methods will be used for the proposed studies. The investigation of the underlying mechanism of
PrCR activation and regulation will enable a better understanding of the basic principles of cancer development
and inspire the invention of more effective cancer immunotherapies. Successful completion of this study will lead
to the identification of novel functional components mediating cancer immune evasion and will immediately
provide novel therapeutic opportunities for a variety of cancers."

The early expansion of the neural progenitor (NP) pool is a critical period, setting the stage for the
development of the cerebral cortex. Alterations in NP proliferation during that period can have devastating
consequences on neuron numbers and circuitry that could eventually lead to a variety of neurodevelopmental
diseases such as autism, micro- and macrocephaly. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that govern
early NP expansion is central to understanding these diseases. Missense mutations or deletion of ZBTB7A
lead to macrocephaly and intellectual disability but the mechanisms underlying these phenotypes are
completely unknown. We discovered an enrichment for ZBTB7A in the nuclei of embryonic mouse NPs, and
our Zbtb7a conditional KO (cKO) mouse model show increased cortical thickness at birth and an early
expansion of the progenitor pool in embryonic cortices. Overexpression of ZBTB7A leads to opposite
phenotypes, with premature differentiation of NPs. Next, we used CUT&RUN to identify ZBTB7A target genes
during early cortical development. This analysis revealed that ZBTB7A binds to the promoters and enhancers
of a regulon composed of transcription factors and cell-cycle regulators. We confirmed that ZBTB7A binds to
the promoter of Hes5, and we observed that ZBTB7A can block Hes5 promoter activity in response to
activated Notch. Finally, we used a novel in vivo BioID approach in E15 NPs to discover ZBTB7A interactors.
This analysis suggests that ZBTB7A interacts with GATAD2A/B proteins, two components of the Nucleosome
Remodeling and Deacetylase complex (NuRD) repressor complex. In this study, we will use a conditional
knockout mouse model to further characterize how Zbtb7a impacts NP proliferation and the establishment of
cortical architecture. In a second step, we will examine how ZBTB7A modulates Notch Signaling to control NP
proliferation. We will use luciferase assays in primary NPs and in utero electroporation to test the relevance of
ZBTB7A sub domains and how ZBTB7A patient mutations affect the expression of Notch targets. In a third
step we will evaluate how ZBTB7A cooperates with the NuRD complex to regulate NP proliferation. For this we
will use in vivo BioID as well as co-immunoprecipitation experiments to discover the composition of NuRD
complexes interacting with ZBTB7A. We will repeat BioID experiments earlier in development and we will use
co-immunoprecipitation to define which NuRD complex proteins associate with ZBTB7A in early NPs. The role
of Gatad2b in NPs is completely unknown, therefore we will use IUE to test if knockdown of Gatad2b mimics
NP proliferation phenotypes linked with Zbtb7a cKO, and to determine the requirement of Gatad2b in Zbtb7a

novel core principles that drive corticogenesis and will deepen our understanding of the etiology of

 Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive blood cancer that currently ranks as the deadliest form
of leukemia in both adults and children. These unsatisfactory outcomes highlight the urgent need to develop
more-effective therapies that either replace or improve the effectiveness existing chemotherapies.
 Metabolic pathways that regulate the synthesis and catabolism of the non-essential amino acid, serine
have recently emerged as therapeutic vulnerabilities in several different types of human cancer. We and others
recently discovered that certain aggressive sub-types of AML, such as those bearing MLL-rearrangements
(MLLR) or internal tandem duplications of the FLT3 genes (FLT3ITD) heavily depend on serine to maintain cell
cycling and the differentiation blockade. Specifically, we found that restriction of dietary serine significantly delays
disease onset in a mouse model of MLLR-AML, while others have shown that chemical inhibition of serine
synthesis impedes MLLR- or FLT3ITD-AML. This proposal aims to address 3 key unanswered questions:
 1) How is serine utilized to support AML? Our preliminary data suggest that AML cells utilize serine to
supply pools of purines and purine-derivatives such as S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which are key anabolic
precursors needed to drive cell proliferation and maintain gene expression programs, respectively. We will use
a combination of metabolomics, transcriptomics and proteomics in genetically engineered mouse (GEM) and
patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of AML to precisely determine how serine is utilized to support AML.
 2) What serine-regulatory enzymes support AML and why? Although several enzymes contribute to
serine metabolism, we have identified MTHFD2 as a particularly important candidate in AML. Specifically, we
have seen that MTHFD2 inhibition promotes the terminal differentiation of MLLR-AML cells and furthermore,
MTHFD2 is the most frequently over-expressed enzyme in human cancer. We have now obtained mice bearing
floxed alleles of murine Mthfd2, which we will use to determine the importance of Mthfd2 in AML and healthy
hematopoiesis. Given that MTHFD2 catalyzes the incorporation of serine-derived carbons into newly synthesized
purines and SAM, we will also examine how Mthfd2 deletion impacts purine and SAM levels as well as the
downstream cellular processes supported by these metabolites, such as proliferation and gene expression.
 3) Can we develop effective serine-targeting therapies in AML? To address this question, we will evaluate
therapeutic strategies for limiting serine availability (e.g. simultaneously restricting dietary serine and serine
synthesis) or chemically targeting MTHFD2 using liposomal nanoparticle technology in mouse models of AML.
 Collectively, the results of these studies will provide new insights into the role of serine metabolism and
potentially establish a foundation for developing novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of AML. Moreover,
serine metabolism is often deregulated in many tumor settings and thus results from our proposed studies will
likely have implications for other forms of human cancers."

The objective of the proposed research is to engineer a targeted biological nanoparticle platform with high
intracranial delivery and glial cell targeting for broad applicability in drug delivery and imaging. A great deal of
work has already been accomplished elucidating the ability of certain extracellular vesicles (EVs) to cross
endothelial barriers, especially the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Other work has established that EVs exhibit
excellent tropism towards particular tissues and cell types. The focus of this proposal is to understand the
mechanisms by which certain EV subpopulations accomplish these feats, and to engineer them into a hybrid
liposome-EV drug delivery platform. Given the plethora of recent research into EV structure and function, it is
well known that they exhibit considerable compositional heterogeneity. But fundamental questions still exist as
to how EV prescribed functions differ across these subpopulations. It is likely that off-target effects and
inefficiencies in capturing native EV functions with engineered mimetics are due to their substantial
heterogeneity. Our first hypothesis is that homogenization of EVs towards a narrow size range with uniform
biomolecular content will result in a more potent and controllable drug delivery platform that maintains native EV
function yet reduces off-target toxicity. Our second hypothesis is that fusion of homogenized EVs and
liposomes with various functions (i.e., efficient BBB permeation through receptor mediated transcytosis) will
deliver an engineered product combining desired functions. We plan on addressing these hypotheses through
rigorous engineering to homogenize EVs (Aim 1) alongside biochemical assays to detangle the mechanisms
important for EV intracranial delivery. We will utilize EVs isolated from gliatropic “experts”, namely a vast library
of glioblastoma (GBM) patient derived primary cell lines, brain-metastasizing breast cancer cells, and other glial
and neuronal cells like astrocytes and neurons. Key molecular players important for intracranial delivery identified
from those studies will feedback into synthesis of engineered EVs (eEVs) via subsequent fusion with carrier EVs
(Aim 2). For the engineered eEV product, we will also incorporate synthetic liposomes decorated with known
ligands to trigger receptor mediated transcytosis through the BBB endothelial layer. To provide the greatest
opportunity to measure efficiency of functional intracranial delivery, we plan to load formulated, labeled, and
homogenized eEVs with a chemotherapeutic payload and determine drug-release profile, biodistribution, and
efficacy in healthy mice with intact BBBs and then an orthotopic GBM model (Aim 3). The proposed work is
important because it seeks to eliminate the highly confounding factor of particle-to-particle variability plaguing
effective application of EVs as potent drug-delivery vehicles. Success in homogenizing eEVs will result in an
increased understanding of their biological function and assist in their application to combat a wide variety of
neurological disorders where current drug delivery approaches are thwarted by low intracranial delivery."

On average, the mothers of children with serious conditions (e.g., mental illnesses, disabilities, developmental
disorders, chronic conditions) face health risks due to caregiving burdens, stress, and other factors that often
counter the many rewarding aspects of their parenting. These health implications appear to be magnified when
children reach adulthood and mothers reach late midlife and beyond. Modern medical and therapeutic
advances have increased the number of mothers in this vulnerable position, and they need support. This
project will further build the theoretically grounded empirical foundation for that support by employing an
innovative life course approach and mixed methods strategy to address this significant public health issue.
Specifically, this project extends and enriches the literature on the physical and mental health of mothers of
children with serious conditions by asking three questions. The first question (“why?”) concerns the complex
ways that the social and psychological rewards and strains of parenting children with serious conditions into
adulthood converge to shape mothers’ health in late midlife. The second question (“when?”) concerns the
potential for cumulative vs. sensitive periods of risk and resilience across years of caring for children with
serious conditions from their births into their adulthoods. The third question (“where?”) concerns the degree to
which family supports in the informal ecology and community health and human services in the formal ecology
moderate the exchange of rewards and strains to buffer health risks among late-midlife mothers of young adult
children with serious conditions. These questions will be addressed with a sequential explanatory mixed
methods strategy in which quantitative results are unpacked by qualitative insights and qualitative insights
guide subsequent quantitative analyses. This strategy integrates statistical analyses of an extant population
database with textual/grounded theory analyses of newly collected qualitative data, both focusing on mothers
in the sixth decade of life. The first involves approximately 3,100 mothers of young adult children (420 of whom
had serious conditions) in the geocoded, multilevel National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979. The second
involves 80 mothers of young adult children with and without serious conditions. This mixed methods sequence
is already vetted and supported by preliminary analyses of the quantitative data published in a high-impact
journal and a smaller-scale qualitative data collection funded by an NIA pilot mechanism. Conducted by an
interdisciplinary team of senior and junior scholars with complementary expertise in the study of families and
health, this project will put forward and refine a life course framework of health and wellbeing in the context of
the indefinite responsibilities of intensive parenting that can guide future research in this area and help to tailor
policies and programs aiming to serve this growing slice of the aging population. The ultimate goal is that this
foundational knowledge will then support the design of a future population study of this issue for public use."

Interleukin-1 (IL-1) plays an important role in the host defense against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the
bacterium that causes human disease tuberculosis (TB). IL-1 is essential for anti-bacterial immunity during Mtb
infection in mice and genetic polymorphisms in IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1) signaling are associated with greater risk
from active pulmonary TB. IL-1R1 is expressed by both the hematopoietic-derived and stromal cells in the lung,
but the cell-type specific roles of IL-1R1-signaling in protective immunity against TB remains unclear.
Supported by a R56 Bridge grant from NIAID, we investigated the contribution of different lung cells to the IL-
1R1 mediated protective immunity. We used bone marrow chimaeras and discovered that IL-1R1 expression
on stromal cells is crucial for protecting mice against severe disease. We generated a panel of knock-in and
knock out mouse strains where IL-1R1 expression is conditionally deleted- or restored in specific cells either
in a wild type or IL-1R1-deficient host background. Our preliminary results indicated that expression of IL-1R1
on type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECII) is both necessary and sufficient for controlling bacterial replication,
inflammation in the lung and preventing wasting disease. AECII-intrinsic IL-1R1 signaling is critical for anti-
mycobacterial immunity and preventing type I IFN (IFN-I) dependent neutrophil influx. Depleting neutrophils or
IFN-I significantly reduced bacterial load, immunopathology. Moreover, AECII-restricted overproduction of GM-
CSF in the lung protected the highly susceptible GM-CSF deficient animals by reducing bacterial load, weight
loss and lung pathology. Importantly, IFN-I blockade rescued alveolar type I (AEC-I) and type II (AECII)
epithelial cells that were otherwise damaged during progressive disease. Based on our preliminary results, we
hypothesize that IL-1R1 signaling in AECII potentiates the anti-microbial function of myeloid cells by GM-CSF
production and restrains the pathological level of IFN-I production to maintain epithelial barrier integrity. We
have three specific aims. In aim1, we will investigate the role of GM-CSF in regulating antimicrobial immunity
by examining bacterial fitness and replication dynamics in myeloid cells obtained from mice that lack or express
IL-1R1 expression in AECII. In aim2, we will investigate the role of AECII-derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in
regulating IFN-I response and consequent pathogenic neutrophil influx to prevent tissue damage. Finally, in
aim3, we will investigate the impact of IFN-I on alveolar epithelial cell repair and regeneration by performing
lineage tracing and spatial analysis of lung epithelial cells in the infected lung samples. Overall, the completion
of these aims will provide mechanistic basis for IL-1R1 mediated protective immunity and reveal principles to
target airway epithelial cells for boosting antimicrobial immunity and limiting the inexorable lung damage
caused during TB that contributes to lung function impairment in patients even after antibiotic therapy."

To ensure survival
, animals must satisfy a variety of needs that lead to what are often mutually
exclusive motivated behaviors. An example of such a behavior is sleep, a process that has
been described in a variety of species ranging from jellyfish to humans. Although the precise
function of sleep remains unknown, there is ample evidence supporting the notion that sleep is
required for maintaining optimal physiological and behavioral performance. Importantly, sleep is
regulated by two processes, the circadian clock which gates the occurrence of sleep, and the
sleep homeostat which controls the intensity and duration of sleep. Beyond the clock and the
homeostat, a variety of sensory inputs and internal states can modulate sleep in significant
ways. For example, animals can dramatically modify, reduce, or completely forego sleep if their
internal needs and/or external circumstances demand it. Importantly, sleep competes with other
essential motivated behaviors, such as feeding. This implies that the decision to engage in,
remain in, or exit sleep behavior must be weighed against the drive to perform other key
motivated behaviors. Thus, to maximize survival, organisms must constantly assess their
environment and their internal needs and alter their physiology and behaviors accordingly. The
mutually exclusive nature of sleep and feeding behaviors implies that each of these individual
motivational drives must not only be able to modulate the neuronal circuits underlying their
associated behavior but also those of the competing one. Although much is known about neural
circuits regulating individual behaviors, interactions between them are less well characterized.
Understanding how behavioral decisions are made, and how the neuronal circuits underlying
different behaviors interact, is a key aspect of modern neurobiology that will help us understand
how the nervous system can help organisms adapt to an ever-changing environment and
prioritize behaviors in a way that maximizes survival. We have identified two novel sleep-
promoting neurons in the Drosophila central nervous system. Interestingly, these neurons also
modulate feeding. In addition, we discovered that the activity of these two neurons is regulated
by diet composition. In this proposal, we will use the power of the Drosophila model to
investigate how these two neurons modulate sleep and feeding. We will identify the circuits,
genes and neuromodulators involved in these relationships. Since the molecular mechanisms
that regulate feeding and sleep are evolutionary conserved between Drosophila and mammals,
we anticipate that this proposal will uncover regulatory principles that are relevant to human
physiology.

dopamine
Abstract
Cognitive flexibility and goal-directed behavior are critical for normal functioning, and their
dysfunction is central to multiple neuropsychiatric conditions, including dementias associated with
neurodegenerative disease. Cortical catecholamines and prefrontal cortical (PFC) dopamine
receptors are potent regulators of cognitive flexibility and goal-directed behavior. In addition to
these cortical mechanisms, striatal dopamine is necessary for motivated behavior (Yin et al.,
2005); however, the cellular, molecular, and projection-specific heterogeneity of PFC projections
to the basal ganglia, the impact of individual PFC catecholamines, and how they regulate striatal
dopamine and motivated behavior, are not clear. A better understanding of the mechanisms by
which PFC and PFC catecholamine signaling regulate cortico-basal ganglia circuitry could lead
to novel therapeutic approaches for addressing cognitive dysfunction in neurological and
psychiatric disorders. Our central hypothesis is that cortical norepinephrine and dopamine play
distinct roles in regulating striatal dopamine dynamics and motivated behavior through PFC D2R+
and D1R+ sub-circuits. Our goal is to use intersectional chemogenetics, fiber photometry and
behavior to decipher the roles of NET and cortical catecholamines in the regulation of motivated
behavior and striatal dopamine dynamics. We will test our hypothesis using the following three
aims: 1) Determine the contributions of the norepinephrine transporter to cognitive flexibility and
striatal dopamine dynamics.2) Determine the contributions of norepinephrine vs. dopamine to
cognitive flexibility and striatal dopamine dynamics. 3) Determine the contributions of PFC D1+
and D2R+ pyramidal neuron subpopulations to striatal dopamine and cognitive flexibility.
The outcomes of this R01 proposal will provide a refined molecular and anatomical framework
describing the functional roles of individual PFC catecholamines in regulating PFC D1/D2R+
circuits, striatal dopamine dynamics and motivated behavior. Given that catecholamine
dysfunction is central to cognitive pathology of dementias, neurological and neuropsychiatric
diseases, our results may reveal novel mechanistic strategies for developing molecular- and
circuit-based therapeutics for these disorders."

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has demonstrable benefits for people living with diabetes, including
improvement in diabetes control and reduction in hypoglycemia. Randomized controlled trials have
demonstrated that CGM can reduce hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and increase in the time in range (TIR) metric.
Little is known about CGM use in the broader population with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in low-income, minority
populations not receiving insulin therapy. This proposed study will rigorously evaluate CGM in a diverse and
vulnerable population with T2DM in the primary care setting. The proposed study will integrate CGM into our
previously studied approach of mobile health (mHealth) diabetes management. Our prior research has
leveraged mHealth tools and a community health worker (CHW)/clinical pharmacist team to manage low-
income, minority populations with T2DM. Clinical pharmacists embedded in the healthcare system review
patient glucose levels, promote medication adherence and collaboratively adjust therapy to help patients reach
HbA1c goals. CHWs augment pharmacist-led efforts and address social determinants of health and provide
individualized, contextual self-management support. In partnership with Baystate Community Health Centers
and UMass Memorial Family Medicine Health Centers, we propose an effectiveness study of team-supported
CGM using a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) study design. We plan to study a
diverse population with 318 T2DM patients receiving pharmacist- and CHW-supported CGM delivered through
community health centers (CHCs) in Massachusetts. The Specific Aims include: (1) Conduct a randomized,
controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of pharmacist-supported CGM in a diverse patient population with
T2DM in the primary care setting. We hypothesize that pharmacist-supported CGM will result in improved
HbA1c, CGM metrics, and other secondary outcomes (e.g., quality of life) at 6 months compared with
pharmacist-only care; (2) Re-randomize patients not at HbA1c goal after 6 months to receive or not receive
CHW support beyond pharmacist-supported CGM. We hypothesize that adding CHWs will result in improved
HbA1c, CGM metrics, and other secondary outcomes at 12 months compared with pharmacist-supported CGM
alone; (3) Evaluate reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance using the RE-AIM
framework; and (4) Determine total cost and cost-effectiveness of CGM and the supportive components (e.g.,
clinical pharmacist and CHW) from the perspective of the healthcare organization. If this team support model of
diabetes care is found to be cost-effective, such evidence may influence insurance restrictions on ambulatory
CGM coverage in T2DM."

 Psychotic disorders are often characterized by recurrent relapses over the course of illness. Relapses impact
occupational and social functioning, may endanger the patient and others, and often require inpatient
hospitalization, driving up healthcare costs. In fact, the cumulative effect of relapses plays a major role in the
quality of life of individuals with psychotic disorders in the long run. The pathophysiology of psychosis relapse
has not been well captured in most previous research, as few studies account for the confounder of
antipsychotic drug non-adherence, which affects most patients with psychosis at some point during treatment
and is often unnoticed. In this proposal, we aim to study the neurobiological mechanisms of psychosis relapse
in individuals treated with long acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics, for whom medication adherence at the
time of relapse can be reliably quantified. We will focus on striatal functioning, given its critical role in the
pathophysiology of psychosis and as a target of antipsychotic drugs. Specifically, we will conduct MRI
assessment of striatal functioning at rest (Aim 1) and during reward processing (Aim 2), as well as of meso-
striatal dopamine transmission using neuromelanin sensitive MRI (Aim 3). We will compare these measures in
a cross-sectional design between individuals with psychosis relapse during treatment with LAI antipsychotics
(n=44), individuals who are symptomatically stable during treatment with LAI antipsychotics (n=44) and healthy
controls (n=32). Our general hypothesis is that individuals experiencing relapse will show greater degree of
aberrant striatal functioning compared with clinically stable individuals on LAI treatment. If successful, this
project will generate data about the pathophysiology of psychosis relapse unbiased for treatment adherence.
Such data are critical to develop much needed prognostic biomarkers for relapse prevention in psychosis."

Expansion of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Outpatient and Inpatient Settings: Quantifying the
Differential Impact Between Disadvantaged and Non-Disadvantaged Communities
 Technology in medicine has often been deployed without explicit attention to disadvantaged
populations, with the idea that “a rising tide lifts all boats.” Yet it is now clear that this assumption has not held
true, particularly in the field of cardiac care and availability of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Racial
and ethnic minorities, low-income individuals, and the uninsured experience persistent and even widening
inequalities in access, treatment, and outcomes. Unfortunately, the literature has focused primarily on
discrimination at the individual or institutional level. Our long-term goal is to identify system-level pathways in
cardiac care that widen disparities between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged communities and patients.
 Our central hypothesis is that that the current pattern of PCI growth has differentially affected
disadvantaged versus non-disadvantaged communities, and that studying these communities separately
allows us to unmask differences that could otherwise be undetected when looking at the average effect. Using
PCI expansion as an identification strategy along with 10 years of patient-level data from California, we
propose to test the hypothesis that the growth of outpatient and inpatient PCI has: (Aim 1) increased the
likelihood of higher-risk or inappropriate patients receiving PCI in non-disadvantaged relative to disadvantaged
communities; (Aim 2) changed patient distribution to low-quality facilities in disadvantaged versus advantaged
communities; and (Aim 3) widened the health disparity gap between patients in disadvantaged and non-
disadvantaged communities through changes in patient profile and/or the quality of PCI facility.
 This study is innovative because it proposes: a) a longitudinal, population-based approach to study all
PCIs done in both outpatient and inpatient settings, not relying solely on hospital-based PCI or PCI registries;
b) a multi-level (individual, hospital, and community) approach to understand differential experiences of
technology expansion for patients, facilities, and communities; and c) use a structural racism and
discrimination lens to focus on the built environment, which present an intervenable target.
 Findings from our research could inform interventions such as local, state, or even federal policy
changes. The current trend appears to be toward allowing as many hospitals as possible to become PCI-
capable, with active legislation (e.g., California AB 370, New Jersey A1176). Current policies and legislation do
not consider impact on equity nor do they incorporate explicit quality metrics. Examples of potential policy
changes include reforms to legal and regulatory changes regarding licensing, credentialing, reimbursement,
and liability; revising definitional requirements of a PCI center; or certificate of need regulations that
thoughtfully incorporate population-based equity measures for health disparity populations."

The overarching goal of this application is the development of new catalysts and reactions to empower the
chemical synthesis of medicinally relevant natural product targets and pharmaceuticals. Specifically, we
formulate a rationale for designing strained and bridged bicyclic phosphine oxides that can readily be reduced
back to phosphines in situ. A novel [2.2.1] bicyclic phosphine oxide has already exhibited reactivity, in both
catalytic Wittig and Staudinger reactions, superior to that of the best alternatives known at the time of its
invention. Theoretical investigations predicted, and we have indeed proved experimentally, that the proposed
[2.1.1] bicyclic phosphine oxides would be even more reactive than any other known phosphine oxides.
Considering the ubiquity of reactions driven by the formation of phosphine oxides, and their environmental
consequences, our proposed research should have significant impact on organic synthesis. Our inspiration for
the [2.2.1] bicyclic phosphine oxides originated from the Hyp-derived chiral phosphines (“HypPhos”) that we
developed during the last funding periods. Building on the greater faculty of the [2.2.1] bicyclic phosphine oxides,
we will apply the HypPhos (oxides) to catalytic asymmetric Staudinger, Wittig, Mitsunobu, and Appel reactions.
The HypPhos (oxides) have already displayed tremendous potential in facilitating enantioselective Mitsunobu
and Appel reactions and the first successful example of a catalytic asymmetric Staudinger/aza-Wittig reaction.
We have also created new [2.2.1] and [2.1.1] bicyclic chiral phosphines (“CarvoPhos”) from carvone. The
CarvoPhos (oxides) should be versatile catalysts because both enantiomers of carvone are naturally abundant.
We will also explore the modularity of our approach to chiral phosphines in the syntheses of (o-hydroxybenzyl)-
HypPhos and -CarvoPhos oxides for redox-neutral phosphine oxide-catalyzed Mitsunobu and Appel reactions.
To build upon the exciting results of enantioselective allene–imine [4+2] annulation, we also put forth a unique
strategy for the assembly of akuammilline alkaloids. Capitalizing on the capacity of phosphines to function both
as organic catalysts and as ligands on homogeneous transition metal catalysts, we have devised a tandem
Michael−Heck reaction of haloalcohols and activated acetylenes for the assembly of 5- and 6-membered carbo-
and heterocycles. One particular Michael−Heck process, employing γ-haloallyl alcohols, is a powerful tactic for
assembling furans with almost any substitution pattern, while also providing access to several structurally
disparate furan sesquiterpenes. At present, 10 of our different HypPhos phosphines are commercially available
through Sigma–Aldrich; we will collaborate with them again to make our chiral phosphines and phosphine oxides
available to the scientific community. Many research groups have already used HypPhos in a variety of
enantioselective chemical catalyses. We anticipate that the proposed research will, similarly, have a significant
impact on chemical synthesis. Collectively, the catalysts and reactions developed in this project will allow the
enantioselective preparation of biologically active pharmaceuticals and natural product targets."

Tissue integrity is maintained by specialized adult stem cells that replenish old and damaged cells. During aging
and in disease states, stem cell function is compromised leading to progressive degeneration of the structure
and function of vital organs. This is particularly apparent in the skeleton, which becomes increasingly fragile and
prone to fractures as we age. To uncover and counteract the mechanisms of skeletal degeneration and enhance
bone repair, we must first define skeletal stem and progenitor cell (SSPC) behavior in vivo and determine the
essential regulators of cellular function. This is a technically challenging feat as, in contrast to other organs where
stem cells reside within a defined physical location and are readily identified by gene and protein expression,
cells with progenitor activity can be found throughout bone and there are no specific markers to identify these in
situ. As a result, we still know remarkably little about SSPCs, including whether a multipotent stem cell exists in
vivo or if bone is maintained by a pool of lineage-restricted progenitors. Additionally, it is unclear whether
progenitors from different locations are functionally equivalent. Recently, we identified several distinct skeletal
populations with stem cell characteristics that demonstrate distinct dynamic responses to injury. We hypothesize
that these correspond to SSPC subtypes from different anatomical regions of bone and that they play unique
roles in skeletal regeneration in homeostasis and injury repair. We will leverage cutting-edge technologies to
investigate this hypothesis. In the first part of this proposal, we will perform parallel in vivo clonal functional and
transcriptional analysis to identify cells with progenitor activity in an unbiased manner, interrogate the
differentiation potential of SSPCs in defined bone regions and distinguish gene expression signatures
associated with precise cellular behaviors. These experiments will, for the first time, establish the phenotype
and function of individual SSPCs in their native environment and across distinct local niches, providing a holistic
overview of the SSPC landscape to enable the identification of novel regulators of stem cell activity and markers
to enable the isolation of therapeutically useful cell populations. In the second part of this proposal, we will chart
the dynamic response and contribution of individual progenitors to the repair of various types of bone
injury. These data will reveal the key cell populations driving discrete stages of bone healing and their
transcriptional response to injury, including the signaling pathway signatures enriched in progenitors. Together
this study will dissect the complex web of skeletal stem cell states to facilitate the development of targeted
strategies to improve bone health and fracture healing."

Dysregulated expression of the MYC family of transcriptional regulators is a common denominator in a wide
spectrum of human cancers, including small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), a highly aggressive neuroendocrine-
type tumor that is among the leading causes of US cancer mortality. MYC family proteins specifically
heterodimerize with MAX in order to bind genomic DNA and stimulate widespread transcription. Surprisingly,
recent reports show that MAX is inactivated through deletions and truncating mutations in a significant subset of
SCLC and other neuroendocrine cancers. The paradox that MAX may act as a tumor suppressor, but yet be
crucial for MYC oncogenicity in SCLC, has important implications for our understanding of the etiology of these
tumors but has not been systematically investigated. This proposal is based on the findings from our two
laboratories that (i) a whole-genome CRISPR inactivation screen in pre-neoplastic SCLC (preSCs) revealed
MAX-targeting sgRNAs to be highly growth promoting; and (ii) deletion of MAX dramatically accelerates SCLC
in an autochthonous mouse model. These results provide, for the first time, highly relevant biological systems to
elucidate MAX's tumor suppressor function.
In Aim 1 we will characterize the biological properties of MAX-deleted SCLC including proliferation, apoptosis
and genomic stability. Moreover, we will use ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq to determine the genomic landscape of
MYC/MYCL and MAX binding and target gene expression in SCLC and MAX-deleted SCLC. We will functionally
interrogate the importance of key MAX target genes identified through integrative genomic analyses. Targets to
be studied will include MAX-dependent regulators of one carbon metabolism already identified. Aim 2 is based
on the hypothesis that MAX deletion not only alters MYC activity but disrupts the broader MYC- MAX
transcriptional network of activators and repressors. We will determine if MYC/MYCL have MAX independent
oncogenic functions in our SCLC models and in human SCLC cell lines, and examine whether network members
that antagonize or cooperate with MYC (such as MXD/MNT, MLX, and MondoA), act to influence SCLC
progression. In Aim 3 we propose to determine core MAX-regulated genes and pathways common to
neuroendocrine tumor suppression by MAX. This will entail molecular and genetic characterization of our new
models of thyroid medullary carcinomas and pheochromocytomas resulting from MAX loss (in an Rb/p53
deficient background) and identification of pathways shared with MAX-null SCLC. This research will extend the
breadth of our studies to uncover how MAX suppresses neuroendocrine cancers. We anticipate that these
studies will deepen our understanding of the complex role of the MYC network in both driving and suppressing

Precise regulation of transcription is required for many cellular processes and misregulation of
gene expression is linked to many human diseases. In prior work, great progress has been
made in identifying important mechanisms and principles of transcriptional regulation. With this
background, and using new technologies and approaches, this is an excellent time to tackle the
next set of fundamental problems in gene regulation that have been difficult to address in prior
work. Two related and important questions in the transcription field are: what are the primary
mechanisms of gene regulation by sequence-specific transcription factors? and, how do these
factors cooperate to orchestrate transcription of cellular genes? To address these questions, we
will focus on three areas involving transcription factor and coactivator specificity and the
activation mechanisms used at many genes: (i) Mechanisms leading to the genome-wide
specificities of the coactivators TFIID and SAGA. Differential use of these coactivators defines
two fundamental gene classes that dictate the mechanisms of preinitiation complex (PIC)
assembly and the response to transcription factors and chromatin. (ii) The gene-specific
functions of the coactivator Mediator in transcriptional regulation. At least two distinct pathways
are used by transcription factors to modulate Mediator function that are transcription factor and
promoter-specific, but the molecular basis of these mechanisms is not well understood. (iii)
Mechanisms of transcription activator specificity and function. We will broaden our current
studies on the function of acidic activation domains to examine mechanisms used by other
widely used activator types and to examine how transcription factors bound at native
UAS/enhancer elements cooperate. To address these fundamental problems, as in past work,
we will use a combination of methods and technologies that include molecular, biochemical,
genomic, computational, and structural approaches. In combination with our strong preliminary
results, these new approaches and directions will reveal important conserved mechanisms and
principles that illustrate how transcription factors, coactivators, chromatin, and the basal
transcription machinery work together to modulate genome-wide transcription."

The Hopkins Population Center (HPC) is a university-wide center providing research infrastructure for
demography, reproductive health, and population health research at Johns Hopkins University (JHU). The
Center has 62 faculty Associates from 7 JHU schools (16 departments). Tapping into Associates’ leading
expertise in social, public health, biomedical, engineering, and statistical sciences, the HPC builds on these
historical strengths and facilitates emerging innovation in specific research areas of population dynamics
research. The HPC is directed by Director, Dr. Lingxin Hao, and two Associate Directors, Drs. Emily Agree and
Li Liu. The HPC has three Specific Aims. Aim 1 is to support the incubation, development, production, and
dissemination of innovative research in three primary research areas (PRAs) – Poverty and Inequality, Sexual
and Reproductive Health, and Family, Maternal and Child Health. The HPC supports the whole spectrum of
innovative research in the PRAs through the Development, Scientific, and Administrative Cores. The
Development Core identifies new ideas from Associates, assembles new teams among HPC Associates
between academic ranks and across disciplines, and provides research development support via a set of
programs. The Development Core ensures internal cohesiveness through the bridging role of PRA
representatives, who are high-profile senior Associates and open up communication channels between
Associates and Core leaders. The Scientific Core focuses its energy on increasing the research rigor and
competitiveness of new and in-progress research projects. The Administrative Core works on the timely
dissemination of new research findings via seminars, conferences, and symposiums. Aim 2 is to support early-
career Associates (ECAs) to accelerate research independence in PRAs. We are continually recruiting ECAs
to nurture their research capacity and independence in HPC’s PRAs and additional effort to meet the specific
needs of underrepresented minority ECAs. Aim 3 is to grow synergy within HPC, JHU, and the broader
community to promote research in population science. The HPC strengthens its centeredness within HPC
among the three Cores, at JHU HPC maintains and further develops alliances with university research
initiatives on common interests to promote population dynamics research, and in the broader community the
HPC will establish partnerships with regional population centers and local institutions serving underrepresented
minorities. The three Cores’ functioning and the synergy across them enable HPC to further its long history of
outstanding contributions to population science. The P2C funding will sustain and expand the provision of
cohesive infrastructural services. With the university’s substantial investment in HPC and HPC’s leveraging
resources of university initiatives, the HPC endeavors to maximize the added value of the requested P2C
funding."

Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are two progressive
neurodegenerative disorders on a spectrum of disease related to the RNA/DNA binding protein TAR DNA-
binding Protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43). Many patients demonstrate an intermediate phenotype of dementia with
motor neuron disease (here called FTLD-ALS). The vast majority of pure FTLD and ALS cases are sporadic
(sFTLD, sALS), with no family history or known genetic mutation. More than 50% of all FTLD and 90% of all ALS
cases manifest a characteristic pathology in affected neurons: hyperphosphorylated, ubiquitinated inclusions of
TDP-43. TDP-43 pathology is often observed in other neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s and
Parkinson’s Diseases, suggesting a common pathogenic mechanism linking TDP-43 dysfunction and
neurodegeneration. TDP-43 aggregates are normally degraded by autophagy, but in FTLD-ALS this machinery
fails, contributing to disease progression. In fact, some familial FTLD-ALS cases are caused by mutations in
autophagy-related proteins. The mechanisms behind TDP-43 aggregation and the neurotoxicity it imparts remain
poorly understood, particularly in sporadic disease. Most animal models rely on overexpression of disease-
associated genetic variants; however, these may be limited in generalizability to sporadic disease. Our lab
identified TDP-43 acetylated at a key lysine residue (Ac-K145) as a driver of TDP-43 pathology. Ac-K145 TDP-
43 is detected in the pathologic inclusions in sALS spinal cord. With the goal of better modeling sporadic illness,
we used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to insert a K145Q acetylation-mimic mutation in the endogenous mouse
Tardbp locus (TDP-43K145Q) to generate a novel model of TDP-43 proteinopathy in sporadic FTLD-ALS. TDP-
43K145Q mice show hallmark pathologies, such as age-dependent cognitive impairment and accumulation of
insoluble TDP-43 in the cortex and spinal cord. This project aims to determine the role of acetylation-mimic TDP-
43 in neurodegeneration and autophagy impairment. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that aging exacerbates the
neurodegenerative phenotype in TDP-43K145Q mice, using behavioral assays of cognitive and motor function,
neuropathologic assessment of cortical tissue, and electrodiagnostic studies of motor unit function. Aim 2 will
test the hypothesis that autophagic flux is impaired in primary cortical neurons of TDP-43K145Q sFTLD-ALS mice,
using an in vitro aging paradigm alongside pharmacologic manipulation of autophagy and biochemical and live-
cell imaging techniques. The long-term goal of this project is to better understand the mechanisms behind TDP-
43-related neurodegeneration and reveal opportunities for therapeutic intervention. This work will provide me
with comprehensive training in both translational and basic science research methods, and I will complement my
research with mentored clinical activities caring for neurodegenerative disease patients. The top-tier research
and clinical opportunities available at UNC Chapel Hill, alongside my mentor, Dr. Todd Cohen, and expert
collaborators, will help launch my career as a leading physician-scientist in neurodegenerative disease biology."

The meningeal lining of the central nervous system is critical for neuronal development and homeostasis.
However, meningeal tumors account for the majority of primary intracranial cancers. Meningiomas are
overwhelmingly diagnosed in older adults, women, and African American patients, all of which are
underrepresented in clinical trials. Thus, there are no effective pharmacologic treatments for meningioma
patients. New therapies have been further encumbered by limited understanding of meningioma biology and a
lack of tractable models for preclinical meningioma investigation. To address these problems, we performed
multiplatform molecular profiling on 565 human meningiomas from patients with comprehensive follow-up data
to discover that meningioma is comprised of 3 epigenetic subgroups with distinct clinical outcomes. Moreover,
we recently developed novel cerebral organoid and patient derived xenograft models for each subgroup of
meningiomas. Our preliminary data presented in this application reveal convergent genetic mechanisms
misactivating the cell cycle at the level of CDK6 in the subgroup of meningiomas with the worst clinical outcomes.
Our central hypothesis is that CDK6 is required for meningioma growth, and that clinical CDK4/6 inhibitors will
show activity in preclinical meningioma models. To test this hypothesis, we will define the efficacy and biomarkers
of response to CDK4/6 inhibitors in meningioma, define the molecular mechanisms underlying CDK6
misactivation in meningiomas, and identify pathways mitigating resistance to CDK4/6 blockade in meningioma.
Our proposal will integrate human samples, organoid models of meningioma tumorigenesis, and understudied
patient derived xenografts with CRISPR interference and pharmacology. This approach is based on the premise
that improving treatments for meningioma patients depends on our ability to identify and target key molecular
mechanisms driving meningioma cell proliferation. We know surprisingly little about how meningiomas develop,
and almost nothing about how to block the molecular mechanisms underlying meningioma growth. Though the
short-term objective of this proposal is to broadly improve our understanding of meningioma cell proliferation, a
long-term goal of this research is to understand this process well enough to develop targeted therapeutic
strategies that will improve treatments and outcomes for meningioma patients. Thus, this work will not only
explain how meningiomas grow, but will also elucidate druggable mechanisms and establish preclinical
foundation to support new clinical trials for meningioma patients."

Hsp70 molecular chaperones are central players in protein homeostasis and quality control. They
mediate a diverse set of cellular functions using a deceptively simple allosteric mechanism. In
their ATP-bound states, they bind substrates with rapid on/off rates and relatively low affinity, and
in their ADP-bound states, substrates bind more tightly with slow association/dissociation. Hsp70s
bind short sequences within unfolded regions of their substrates, preferring hydrophobic residues
with flanking positively charged residues. Their transition between a high substrate affinity, ADP-
bound state, and a low substrate affinity, ATP-bound state, involves major conformational
rearrangement of both the N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain, and the C-terminal substrate-
binding domain. While recent research has shed light on this allosteric conformational change,
many questions remain and are the focus of the proposed research. What are the features of their
substrate-binding sites that enable binding to many but not all sequences (they are “selectively
promiscuous”)? Hsp70s work with partner co-chaperones, the J-proteins that help with cellular
localization and delivery of specific substrates, and the nucleotide-exchange factors that facilitate
replacement of ADP by ATP in the allosteric cycle. What are the structural origins of these
partnerships, and how do they affect substrate binding and release? Preliminary results and
literature observations suggest that Hsp70s can bind nearly isoenergetically to their extended
polypeptide substrates in either an N- to C-orientation or a C- to N-orientation. This provocative
bimodal substrate binding may have functional implications. The proposed work will examine the
structural origins of this capability as well as the potential impact on the functions of the
chaperone. Past work shows that the allosteric properties of Hsp70 are tunable by amino acid
substitutions and by post-translational modifications. The proposed work will delve into the
structural origins of this tuning, and the consequences of changes in the allosteric energy
landscape for specific Hsp70 functions. Past work leaned heavily on peptide models to
understand how Hsp70s bind their substrates. We will characterize the binding of Hsp70s to
protein substrates to learn how the affinity for short sequence motifs translates into a hierarchy of
site binding: are flanking sequences involved in selection of binding sites? How pivotal is
accessibility? Lastly, the role of the Hsc70 chaperone in preparing SNAP-25 to participate in pre-
synaptic vesicle docking and fusion in neurons will be studied. Methods that will be deployed in
the proposed work include biochemical assays, nuclear magnetic resonance, fluorescence, mass
spectrometry, and computational modeling."

People with type 1 diabetes (T1D) have autoimmune destruction of beta cells resulting in insufficient insulin to
maintain normal glucose levels, thereby requiring exogenous insulin treatment, typically delivered
subcutaneously either continuously infused through an insulin pump or by injection multiple times throughout
the day. There are now commercial closed loop systems available that enable automated delivery of fast-
acting insulin in response to wireless continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensors that inform an automated
control algorithm to calculate and deliver insulin via a pump. Unfortunately, current commercial closed loop
systems are hybrid systems that require users to announce meals to the system, and these hybrid systems do
not control glucose well following meals. People oftentimes forget to announce their meals or misestimate their
carbohydrate intake, thereby leading to poor overall postprandial glucose control. The primary benefit of hybrid
closed loop systems has been during the overnight period when meals are not consumed. In a normal working
beta cell, the hormone amylin is co-secreted with insulin in response to meals to help suppress glucagon
production and delay gastric emptying, thereby reducing postprandial glucose increases. Pramlintide is an
analog of the endogenous hormone amylin. Our commercial partner, Adocia, has developed a coformulation of
insulin and pramlintide. In this project, we will develop a dual hormone (insulin and pramlintide), fully
automated closed loop system with a meal detection algorithm that will enable substantial improvements in
postprandial glycemic control for people with T1D while minimizing patient burden by not requiring a meal
announcement to the system. Our group has previously developed a multi hormone closed loop system
(insulin and glucagon) and we have developed models of insulin, pramlintide, glucagon, and carbohydrate
kinetics and dynamics that will be integrated into a new insulin+pramlintide closed loop model predictive
control (MPC) system (Aim 1). We have also developed a meal detection algorithm that will be integrated with
this MPC control algorithm to dose insulin and pramlintide shortly after a meal is detected, thereby eliminating
the need for the user to announce this meal to the system (Aim 1). We will use our in silico simulator of glucose
metabolism to identify the optimal dosing amount and timing when insulin and pramlintide are delivered in
response to the meal detection algorithm (Aim 1). Next, we will evaluate the optimal insulin and pramlintide
dosing therapies identified in Aim 1 and evaluate the top 4 strategies during an in-clinic meal test in a 4-arm
randomized crossover study in 14 people with T1D (Study 1a, Aim 2). We will then evaluate the optimal insulin
and pramlintide dosing therapy identified in Study 1a and compare with various insulin-only hybrid and
automated therapies in an in-clinic randomized crossover study (Study 1b, Aim2). Finally, in Aim 3, we will
evaluate the optimal insulin and pramlintide dosing therapy determined in Aim 2 and compare it with the
Tandem Diabetes Control-IQ commercial hybrid closed loop system."
10915038,"The complement systems of humans and laboratory animals (mice and rats) show striking species differences in function, particularly with regards to the classical pathway of complement activation. Indeed, studies since the 1950’s have documented markedly reduced classical pathway function in mice as compared to rats and humans. In preliminary data, we confirm and extend these findings using model immune complexes (ICs) formed by monoclonal antibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4) and heparin (KKO ICs) or polyclonal rabbit anti-dinitrophenol (DNP) antibodies to DNP conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (DNP ICs). Specifically, we show: 1) robust C3 activation by KKO and DNP ICs in whole blood and plasma from mice, rats and humans 2) classical pathway requirements for complement activation by KKO ICs in rats and human, but alternative pathway requirements in mice 3) incorporation of alternative pathway proteins into KKO ICs in mice, but not rats or humans 4) comparable requirements for the alternative pathway among four murine strains and 5) differential expression of alternative pathway proteins by proteomics in mice as compared to rats and humans. Based on these preliminary data and published observations, we will test the overall hypothesis that impaired classical pathway activity in mice is counterbalanced by the alternative pathway C3b feedback cycle. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following two aims: 1) Comparative studies of human, mouse, and rat complement systems. In this aim, we will test that hypothesis that genetic variation in murine classical pathway proteins contributes to impaired classical pathway function. We will apply molecular approaches to compare genetic sequences and perform structural homologies of classical pathway proteins in mice v rats and humans. In other studies, we will investigate the plasma proteome of mice, rats, and humans to examine protein/immune complex interactions, co-expression of complement and complement-associated proteins and correlate complement protein levels with functional responses to KKO and DNP ICs. 2) Functional studies of murine and human complement systems. In this aim, we will test the hypothesis that mice utilize the C3b feedback cycle of the alternative pathway as a compensatory response to low classical pathway activity. To test this hypothesis, we will use purified human and mouse complement proteins to demonstrate reduced impaired classical C3 convertase activity and normal/heightened activity of the C3b feedback cycle in mice, examine the effects of interchanging human and mouse complement proteins, and identify potential murine inhibitors of classical pathway activation from mouse serum. Together, these studies are expected to delineate the molecular and functional basis of divergent complement pathway responses in mice and humans. We expect these studies to generate preliminary data for an expanded application to elucidate the molecular and structural divergence of murine complement responses with the long term goal of developing translationally relevant animal models."

The number of individuals with metabolic diseases like obesity and type 2 diabetes is growing at overwhelming
rates globally, increasingly affecting younger populations, and disproportionally affect under-served
communities. Emerging clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory research has demonstrated an essential role for
gut bacteria in the regulation of metabolism. Another key contributor to the pathogenesis of these metabolic
diseases are the sphingolipids ceramides. Ceramides are produced in response to increased fat intake and
mediate many of the molecular pathways that cause increased lipid uptake, insulin resistance, and fatty liver
disease. A few studies have begun to investigate the relationship between the gut microbiota, ceramides, and
metabolic diseases, and have shown that the microbiota can regulate ceramide production. Despite these
studies, it remains unclear which bacteria and how these bacteria impact ceramide production and ultimately
host metabolism. Our lab has identified a community of Clostridia Class bacteria that provide metabolic
protection from a high-fat diet in the form of decreased weight gain, improved leanness, and lower fasting
glucose. Furthermore, we have found that Clostridia reduce the rate of ceramide production.
The objective of this proposal is to understand which bacteria are essential to providing metabolic protection and
determine how these bacteria are impacting ceramide synthesis and overall host metabolism. We hypothesize
that select Clostridia bacteria can protect from features of metabolic disease through decreasing ceramides and
reducing lipid absorption in the gut epithelium. We will test this hypothesis in two aims: 1) defining the community
of Clostridia that protect from features of metabolic disease induced by a high-fat diet, and 2) determining if
Clostridia decrease ceramides and lipid absorption in the gut epithelium. Aim 1 will continue to culture, genetically
characterize, and define the most limited community of Clostridia that provides metabolic protection. Aim 2 will
use in vitro and in vivo approaches with germ-free (GF) and gnotobiotic mouse models to assess the relationship
between Clostridia and ceramides in the context of lipid absorption. This proposed work will have a significant
impact on the study of the metabolic disease and the microbiota by providing novel insight into microbiota-driven
mechanisms that can be leveraged for therapeutic benefit."

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 10% of the population worldwide. More than 37 million people are
estimated to have CKD in the US, and 2 in every 1000 Americans need dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive.
CKD has numerous systemic complications including anemia and dysfunctional systemic iron homeostasis.
Kidney fibrosis is the final mechanism common for all progressive kidney disorders. Unfortunately, very few
therapies are available to slow the progression of kidney fibrosis in patients with CKD. Kidney macrophages are
one of the key cells implicated in the pathophysiology of kidney fibrosis. The majority of kidney macrophages
originate from circulating monocytes. In his K08-funded project Dr. Akchurin elucidated the pathologic role of
depletion of labile iron pool in kidney macrophages in propagation of kidney fibrosis. This R03 proposal will
enhance his capabilities of deciphering the role of iron in pathologic behavior of myeloid cells in CKD by now, in
addition to kidney macrophages focusing on their precursors, circulating monocytes. Based on the preliminary
data, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that in patients with CKD, circulating monocytes, similar to kidney
macrophages, exhibit pathologically depleted intracellular labile iron pool LIP, which alters their phenotype by
inducing CX3CR1 and other receptors facilitating chemotaxis and tissue invasion. Repletion of this intracellular
monocyte labile iron pool through correction of systemic iron imbalance will be associated with reduction of this
pro-inflammatory differentiation. This hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims: (1) determine the intracellular
iron status of classical, intermediate, and non-classical circulating monocytes in patients with CKD and (2)
elucidate the role of systemic and intracellular iron status in the differentiation of monocytes in patients with CKD.
To test this hypothesis, the applicant will use the existing repository of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
collected from children with CKD with and without functional or absolute iron deficiency and from healthy control
children. He will evaluate these cells using single cell transcriptomic and multicolor flow cytometry approaches
with the focus on delineating the phenotypic features responsible for subsequent tissue invasion, such as
expression relevant chemokine receptors, including CX3CR1. Furthermore, he will perform ex vivo evaluation of
human monocytes collected from CKD patients to directly assess their relevant functional characteristics in the
presence and absence of iron stimulation. Monocyte functional characteristics will be analyzed I the context of
clinical parameters, levels of circulating and urine-excreted chemokines, and systemic parameters of iron
homeostasis. Results

an
kidney
 from t he outlined experiments will provide preliminary data, as well as experience in
for the functional ex-vivo testing of uman monocytes, to support the K08 awardee's application for
R01 proposal to evaluate the impact of iron metabolism and iron therapy on myeloid cells in the context of
fibrosis and CKD progression.

10824336,"Interphase chromatin is hierarchically organized in chromosome territories, active and inactive compartments, and
topologically associating domains (TADs). Gene expression is controlled by regulatory chromatin elements (enhancers
and promoters) that bind transcription factors and interact within, but not across TAD boundaries. Recent advances in
single cell biology have revealed a tremendous amount of cell-to-cell variability in both chromatin topology and protein
coverage. Even though TADs appear to delineate functional units at the population level, their boundaries only emerge as
average properties from large ensembles of cells. TAD-like structures persist even in the absence of boundaries at the
ensemble level. Similarly, single cell ChIP-seq has revealed sub-states with distinct epigenetic profiles at enhancers in a
population of stem cells. But no assay exists to link topological and functional variability by reading out protein coverage
and epigenetic signatures simultaneously from single cell chromatin traces. Here, we will leverage recent advances in
multiplexed chromatin imaging and single molecule super-resolution microscopy to fill in this gap. In Aim I, we will
characterize the tradeoff between sequence resolution and spatial precision in multiplexed chromatin imaging. We will
then use optimized conditions to map super-resolved protein signal to chromatin topologies at genomic resolution. In Aim
II, we will extend the capabilities of the assay to detect multiple protein signatures simultaneously. Such combinatorial
data on protein signatures of regulatory elements at genomic resolution is not available through any other single cell
assay. We will further characterize the performance of the assay under challenging conditions by mapping both stably
integrated, widespread histone modifications and transiently binding sequence-specific transcription factors with a sizable
unbound fraction to chromatin. Using computational clustering strategies, we will stratify the data by chromatin topology
to determine if structural variation is driven by specific protein factors such as transcription factors that orchestrate long-
range enhancer interactions. Finally, we will establish protocols and technological solutions to accelerate acquisition,
processing, and visualization of statistically meaningful datasets comprising 100s-1000s of single alleles. The resulting
datasets will provide unprecedented insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying cell-to-cell variability in chromatin
topology and serve as a powerful hypothesis generator for investigating single cell genome structure-function
relationships."
10816609,"Abstract
Enlarged extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid volume (CSF in the subarachnoid space) is an encouraging
neuroimaging biomarker for the early detection of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), particularly for
autism spectrum disorder. The link between extra-axial CSF accumulation and NDDs is not yet fully clear. We
propose that maternal immune activation (MIA) can help to inform about this question. Clinical and animal
studies implicate MIA during the gestational period as a significant etiological cause of NDDs. MIA is
associated with increases in maternal proinflammatory cytokines, and some of these cytokines can cross the
placenta and reach the fetal brain. MIA-related changes in the fetal brain cytokine milieu can cause adverse
effects on neurodevelopment, because, besides immune function, cytokines have a signaling function in the
brain and participate in the regulation of neurogenesis and synaptogenesis. Several findings also point to the
possible pathways on how MIA can be associated with CSF volume. The cytokines can increase CSF
secretion, inflammation with bacterial endotoxin decreases CSF flow, and cytokines also might modulate the
meningeal lymphatic-glymphatic exchange and CSF reabsorption. In this study, we propose to take advantage
of a large number of previously acquired neuroimaging scans of young monkeys from controlled rearing
conditions to interrogate the impact of prenatal inflammatory events on EA-CSF volume during infancy. We
hypothesize that these well-defined insults will reveal selective effects on the accumulation of CSF in
subarachnoid space, which can be detected with structural MRI during the postnatal period. The findings will
help to guide similar analyses in pediatric samples and may reveal novel diagnostic tools for use in pediatric
practice. Our preliminary results suggested a significant increase in extra-axial CSF volum in monkeys
prenatally exposed to bacterial endotoxin."

Neutrophils are the first line of defense against bacteria and fungi and induce inflammation. The study of the
molecular mechanisms mediating neutrophil activation is therefore of fundamental importance. Visualizing these
mechanisms requires unique, state-of-the-art technologies and approaches. To achieve this, Core B is designed
to coordinate, design, develop and execute new technical approaches applied to the understanding of neutrophil
biology in inflammation. Core B will work with all three Projects and will provide relevant imaging and microscopy
assays in mice and human samples. The core utilizes available cutting-edge technology to implement new
experimental approaches and to help elucidate the intricate cell biology processes proposed in research plans
of Projects 1 (Dr. Hedrick), Project 2 (Dr. Catz) and Project 3 (Dr. Hoffman). To this end, we will have the
dedicated effort of a Technology Core director (Dr. Kiosses) who will allocate specific time and efforts to support
the goals of the PPG. Core B optimizes the workflows of neutrophil imaging, image quantification and data
sharing for all projects. It provides stringent quality controls and ensures uniformity of performance of multiple
key technologies applied to the study of neutrophils and precursors in the setting of coronary artery disease.
Core B will implement unique live-cell approaches to study neutrophil vesicular trafficking, cytoskeleton
remodeling and cell death pathways. Core B is technically and conceptually innovative because it utilizes,
neutrophil-dedicated, novel approaches that include super-resolution microscopy and quantitative analyses of
neutrophil dynamics to elucidate neutrophil functions and to elucidate their role in inflammation. In relationship
with Project 1, Core B will identify neutrophils and their precursors in atherosclerotic plaques during NETosis
and pyroptosis in conditions of inflammasome activation at various stages of plaque development in high-fat diet,
both ex-vivo and in vivo using the ApoE-/- Western diet model of CAD mice. In association with Project 2, Core
B will utilize single-molecule super-resolution microscopy and Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy
to study molecular mechanisms regulating vesicular trafficking and actin remodeling in neutrophil precursors.
Core B will also utilize Correlated-Light Electron Microscopy (CLEM) to characterize the newly identified
precursor-specific granules (PSGs). In collaboration with Project 3, Core B will examine three-dimensional
localization and spatial changes in the mitochondrial network as the cells undergo apoptotic or necroptotic cell
death in both neutrophils and their precursors from mouse models and human neutrophils from patients with
CAD. In conclusion, Core B is uniquely designed to use the valuable technology available in La Jolla to the fullest
extent possible to maximize neutrophil-dedicate research and productivity associated with the PPG."

Neutrophils acutely respond to inflammatory signals in tissues and play a role in cardiovascular disease
(CAD). After activation by cholesterol and oxidized low density lipoproteins, neutrophils produce cytokines,
degranulate to release myeloperoxidase, azurocidin, and elastase, generate neutrophil extracellular traps
(NETs), and trigger lytic cell death. Neutrophils are produced in the bone marrow by stem cell progenitors
and, once mature, egress to blood and tissues to fight inflammation. We recently discovered an early
committed neutrophil progenitor stem cell (NeP) present in human and mouse bone marrow. Here, we
present new data demonstrating the presence of NeP in the peripheral blood of mice and humans with
CAD, suggesting that NeP modulate granulopoiesis and inflammation outside of the bone marrow. In this
project, we will focus on inflammation via activation of the Nlrp3 inflammasome, as we find that Nlrp3 and
ll1b are highly expressed in NeP. Activation of the inflammasome sensor Nlrp3 triggers a robust
inflammatory response, including IL-1β production. In Project 1, we hypothesize that activation of the
Nlrp3 inflammasome within NeP triggers granulopoiesis and neutrophil heterogeneity which
promotes atherosclerosis progression. We will test our hypothesis by studying inflammasome
activation in both mice and humans with cardiovascular disease (CAD). In Specific Aim 1 we will test
how neutrophil subsets are phenotypically and functionally changed in human CAD patients
compared to healthy subjects. These subjects are undergoing medically necessary coronary
angiography as part of the ongoing Coronary Assessment in Virginia (CAVA) study, and their extent of
atherosclerosis is measured clinically. We will analyze NeP, neutrophil heterogeneity, and the role of the
neutrophilic Nlrp3 inflammasome in blood of these subjects and link these findings to clinical parameters.
In Specific Aim 2 we will use atherosclerotic mouse models to test how intrinsic action of the Nlrp3
inflammasome in neutrophils impacts granulopoiesis and atherosclerosis. We will use mixed
chimeric mouse models with Nlrp3-/-, Gsdmd-/-, and Gsdme-/- mice to assess how inflammasome pathways
in NeP regulate granulopoiesis. New neutrophil-specific and macrophage-specific Nlrp3 knock-out mice
crossed to atherosclerosis-susceptible, apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE-/-) mice will be used to directly
compare how action of neutrophil vs macrophage Nlrp3 inflammasomes impact neutrophil heterogeneity
and atherosclerosis. We will use a new mouse model to assess Nlrp3 action in NeP versus mature
neutrophils on atherosclerosis. We will define how Nlrp3 inflammasome activation in neutrophil progenitors
impacts granulopoiesis and atherosclerosis, which in turn could lead to new therapeutic approaches
targeting Nlrp3 components in neutrophils for atherosclerosis and other inflammatory diseases."
10910068,"Project Summary/Abstract
Intracellular vesicular transport is essential for all aspects of neutrophil physiology and defects in this mechanism
leads to disease in humans. Uncontrolled neutrophil activation and neutrophil secretory proteins are associated
with the development of systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, coronary artery disease (CAD) and
autoinflammatory disease. We found that the recently identified neutrophil progenitors (NePs) and immature
neutrophils contain morphologically and functionally unique secretory organelles. We also show that both the
inflammasome and exposure to high-fat diets (HFD) differentially regulate neutrophil activation and this is
affected by their maturation state. We have identified several key regulatory factors essential for the control of
neutrophil granule trafficking in vitro and in vivo, including the small GTPase Rab27a, its effectors JFC1 and
Munc13-4, and NeP-specific effectors. The control of specific vesicular trafficking pathways in neutrophil
precursors constitutes a unique approach to reduce inflammatory disorders highlighting the need for treatments
targeting these pathways. In this application, we will use genetically modified mouse models and human
neutrophils, to test the hypothesis that molecular mechanisms of vesicular trafficking and neutrophil functions
differentially modulate neutrophils- and NePs-mediated inflammation in CAD. We will study neutrophil functions
in hyperlipidemia in CAD (collaboration with Project 1) and inflammasome-mediated mechanisms (collaboration
with Project 3). We will use novel inhibitors of neutrophil secretion in translational approaches to reduce
inflammation. The significance of the proposed research is that elucidating the mechanisms regulating vesicular
trafficking and secretion in neutrophils and NePs will lead to effective strategies for the treatment of systemic
inflammation in CAD. To test our hypotheses we propose the following Specific Aims: 1) Test the hypothesis that
hyperlipidemia differentially regulates vesicular trafficking and associated functions in neutrophils and precursors
in CAD; 2) Elucidate the mechanisms of azurophilic granule exocytosis dysregulation induced by inflammasome
activation in mature neutrophils and their precursors; 3) Mechanistic and translational studies of neutrophil-
mediated inflammation in CAD. The proposed research should uncover the molecular mechanisms regulating
vesicular transport in neutrophil precursors and lead to effective new strategies to treat inflammation in CAD."

Interleukin-1b is a pro-inflammatory cytokine in cardiovascular disease (CVD) contributing to life-threatening
cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction and stroke. Interleukin-1a also contributes to disease. The
cell types and signaling pathways that control IL-1a/b production remains to be comprehensively evaluated. This
study will investigate the neutrophil lineage in cardiovascular disease and their role in IL-1a/b production.
Neutrophil accumulation in tissues is a hallmark feature of many acute and chronic inflammatory diseases,
including coronary artery disease. Despite our broad understanding of the factors controlling neutrophil
production and function, we lack a comprehensive understanding of cell death signaling in the neutrophil lineage
at steady state and during inflammation. In patients with coronary artery disease, neutrophils accumulate in
atherosclerotic plaques, and are enriched in areas that are prone to rupture and intraplaque hemorrhage. In
mouse models of coronary artery disease (CAD), atherosclerotic plaques feature an accumulation of neutrophils
in early and advanced stages of disease, and neutrophil depletion impairs the early recruitment of monocytes to
the aortic arch and the progression of atherosclerosis. We hypothesize that neutrophils release IL-1 in CAD by
engaging the NLRP3 inflammasome, the Caspase-8-regulated apoptosis pathway, or the MLKL-regulated
necroptotic pathway. The control of Caspase-8-dependent apoptosis and IL-1 release by Bcl-2 family members
will be evaluated in neutrophil lineage cells including neutrophil progenitors (NePs), immature neutrophils, and
mature neutrophils. The effects of CAD on IL-1 production and cell death signaling in human neutrophil lineage
cells will be assessed. This research will identify pro-survival signals in coronary artery disease increasing
neutrophil longevity, and pro-death signals that control IL-1 production, formation of neutrophil extracellular traps,
release of mitochondria, and inflammatory forms of cell death."

The Tulane National Primate Research Center (TNPRC) has one of the largest rhesus monkey breeding colonies
in the US. This resource has provided animals for NIH funded HIV/AIDS research projects for several decades
and is a critical component of the Center's successful research program. Because over half of all research
projects at TNPRC are initiated by Affiliate (non-TNPRC) investigators, this resource is essential to the
success of many NIH-funded investigators throughout the US. The TNPRC has a long history of deriving,
developing, and managing large macaque breeding colonies. The experience derived from many years of colony
management is a significant contributing factor to the successful establishment of the U42 SPF colony and
achieving the goal of converting the entire TNPRC rhesus monkey colony to SPF status. The TNPRC has
focused on a philosophy of continuous improvement, which is fostered by the use of evidence, derived from
observation, controlled scientific study, and the literature to drive decision making. This philosophy is employed
in many areas of the program including housing, behavioral management, husbandry practices, nursery rearing,
preventive medicine, and clinical veterinary care. The objective of this application is to request funds for
continued support and maintenance of this SPF rhesus monkey breeding colony at the TNPRC. The
maintenance of the U42 breeding colony requires the integration of many aspects of the animal care program at
TNPRC including veterinary care, behavioral management, genetic monitoring, and viral testing to ensure SPF
status of the colony. This section describes the husbandry and management of the colony and focuses on daily
care operations, behavioral management, and clinical care.
The Specific Aim of this core is to provide husbandry and veterinary care for the SPF breeding colony established
in the existing U42 grant. This includes robust programs for clinical care and behavioral management. The colony
has reached a mature status of approximately 1400 animals (SPF4 n=1269; eSPF n=131) with ideal
demographics to produce up to 150 animals per year for research assignment based on production and demand.
Program Income generated by the sale of animals will be returned to an account for use in supporting the aims
of the grant."
10886704,"During fetal development and early childhood, growth of the bony skull accommodates a rapid expansion of the
underlying brain. This is accomplished first by progenitors that grow the individual skull bones, and then by stem
cells residing in the flexible bony joints called sutures. In a common birth defect called craniosynostosis (1 in
2000 live births), loss of the cranial sutures results in bony fusions that impede brain growth, thus leading to
cognitive impairment if left untreated. Surgical correction involves invasive and risky surgeries on infants to break
apart the fused bones. Unfortunately, the skull bones often re-fuse, necessitating repeated surgeries. There is
thus a critical need to better understand the causes of craniosynostosis, such that we can develop therapies that
minimize repeated surgical interventions. In the previous funding cycle, we generated and characterized the first
zebrafish model of Saethre-Chotzen Syndrome, which preferentially affects the coronal suture. In so doing, we
pinpointed early changes in the growth rates of the embryonic skull bones as a major cause of suture fusions. In
this renewal we address three outstanding questions in the field of craniosynostosis. In Aim 1, we investigate
the embryonic origins of the suture stem cells that grow and maintain the skull. While suture stem cells have
been studied at postnatal stages, whether they arise from progenitors at the tips of growing bones, or alternatively
from migrating cells, remains debated. By generating the first single-cell transcriptomes of the developing mouse
and zebrafish coronal sutures, we have uncovered conserved embryonic cell types and molecular markers for
suture progenitors. Using new lineage tracing tools in mouse and fish, we will test that bone front progenitors
expressing ETS-family transcription factors are the origin of suture-resident stem cells. In Aim 2, we investigate
how the Saethre-Chotzen genes Twist1 and Tcf12 regulate the transition from bone front progenitors to suture
stem cells. Preliminary data reveal that Twist1 and Tcf12 upregulate the Bmp antagonists Grem1 and Noggin
during suture formation, suggesting that tighter regulation of Bmp signaling is essential to slow bone growth and
prevent fusions. Using mouse conditional genetics and new zebrafish mutants, we will test that direct regulation
of Grem1 and Noggin expression by Twist1 and Tcf12 is necessary and sufficient for regulated bone growth and
normal suture formation. In Aim 3, we address a central mystery of the craniosynostosis field – why do particular
mutations tend to affect only particular sutures? By generating and contrasting new zebrafish models for 11
coronal and 7 midline craniosynostosis genes, we will test whether coronal suture formation is particularly
sensitive to mutations that perturb the rate of bone growth. To do so, we will make use of new zebrafish
transgenic reporters that allow quantitative in vivo measurements of osteoblast addition and suture formation. A
strength of the proposal is the unique team of experts in zebrafish, mouse, and human craniofacial genetics. By
using model organisms to understand the developmental bases for diverse types of craniosynostosis, we strive
toward developing more targeted treatments for craniosynostosis patients with particular genetic mutations."

The University of Puerto Rico at Rio Piedras has a remarkable record in research training and
the development of undergraduates that pursue graduate and doctoral programs in science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). This sharply contrasts with the track record
of high schools in Puerto Rico with regards to students that are interested in STEM careers
and/or that have the competences to pursue a career in STEM. Confronted with this disparity,
we aim to develop a program for the training and education in STEM of high school teachers in
Puerto Rico, and their students, that focus on the development of science and engineering
practices. Our rationale is that by targeting teachers through this project we will contribute in
the education and training of Puerto Rican high school students. Our program will also provide
multiple activities – including a summer immersion program- through which high school students
will be able to explore their interest in STEM. Specifically, we propose an innovative approach
that includes traditional professional development activities for teachers in STEM fields, and an
authentic research experience in which teachers and students are integrated and involved in
researching a particular health problem that concerns everyone in the Puerto Rican society.
Puerto Rico, due to its geographic location and its inherent climate, has one of the highest
asthma rates per inhabitant worldwide (14.2%) and this situation increased after the passage of
Hurricane María in 2017. Our proposal reconciles the efforts and resources of the University of
Puerto Rico, the Molecular Sciences and Research Center, the Puerto Rico Department of
Health, and the Puerto Rico Department of Education. The main goal is to, while generating
awareness of an important health issue in Puerto Rico, increase the number of STEM teachers
engaged in science practices that will enable them to teach science through research and take
on an active role in the preparation of students to develop them as a competitive future
knowledge-based society."

When selecting cancer therapy, physicians generally begin with first-line treatment options and monitor patient
progress on a watch-and-wait basis, following a set of guidelines based on clinical trials from a large patient
population. But this traditional method has been questioned on whether it provides individual patients with the
optimal treatment. To better find a matching treatment individually, a concept called precision cancer medicine
or personalized cancer medicine has been studied. Among other approaches, functional precision medicine
directly tests chemotherapy options on tumor cells biopsied from a patient to find the best matching treatment
for the specific patient.
This promising approach, however, has not been widely adopted by clinicians because the tumor
microenvironment in a lab differed from the one within the patient’s body, leading to inconsistent drug
responses between the sample and patient, and the quantity of biopsied cells is generally insufficient for a
reliable number of options to be tested. The first problem is being addressed by recent advances in three-
dimensional (3D) cell culture techniques, which better mimic the body’s microenvironment in a lab. But the
second problem, the limited number of testable options, is mainly due to limitations in the current assay
techniques that assess chemosensitivity in 3D culture. With most current assays, a sample can only be tested
once, and multiple drugs with different mechanisms of action cannot be simultaneously tested by a single
assay. Combined, these limitations exponentially reduce the number of testable options when involving
multiple assessment time points to design a sequential therapy or when increasing the number of drugs to test
a combination therapy.
Here, we will develop a new technique for the assessment of chemosensitivity in 3D culture, by maximizing the
potential of a label-free 3D microscopy technology, called optical coherence tomography (OCT). The majority
of prior OCT research measured only one or two types of signals and showed the signals corresponding to
only a single type of cell viability disruption process in each study. But this approach has led to a concern
about specificity (i.e., other types of processes than the one tested in the study can generate similar OCT
signals). This low specificity, along with unclear mechanisms of viability assessment, have prevented OCT
methods from being adopted for the promising concept of functional precision medicine.
Therefore, we will develop at least 18 different types of OCT signals and establish their sensitivity and
specificity to four major types of viability disruption processes. The feasibility of this approach has been
strongly supported by a pilot study where we imaged and analyzed more than 6,000 3D-cultured cell
spheroids. This R01 project will image and analyze up to 100,000+ spheroids for an unprecedentedly systemic
investigation of the comprehensive range of OCT signal types."

Skull development requires the proper function of sutures, comprised of the edges of adjacent bones (osteogenic
fronts, OFs) and intervening suture mesenchyme (SM). Suturogenesis is a complex and intriguing process,
particularly for the coronal suture between the frontal and parietal bones of the calvaria. Coronal suturogenesis
involves the migration of osteoprogenitors through ectocranial mesenchyme to the OFs at early embryonic
stages and maintenance of the SM to preserve an open suture that develops a stem cell niche postnatally.
Misregulation of suturogenesis is a significant source of human pathology, such as wider sutures or
craniosynostosis (CRS), the premature fusion of sutures. CRS can adversely affect neurological development
and requires corrective surgery. The coronal suture is the most frequently fused suture in syndromic CRS, which
is generally thought to result from an imbalance between osteoprogenitor induction, proliferation, and
differentiation. The cell populations involved are poorly defined in terms of their transcriptional signatures and
spatial organization, hindering understanding of the effects of genes mutated in coronal CRS. Understanding the
pathogenesis of CRS has positive implications for human health in providing insight toward treating dysgenesis.
In this proposal we will analyze murine coronal suturogenesis in three increasingly focused Aims: 1) define the
organization of transcriptionally-characterized cell populations; 2) establish the roles of a newly identified SM
population; and 3) investigate the role of the hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway that when altered can result in
CRS in humans and mice. For Aim 1, we will generate and integrate spatial transcriptomics and single-cell
(sc)RNA-seq analyses between embryonic day (E)12.5-E18.5 in wild type (WT) mice and two models of
syndromic coronal CRS. From this, we will generate a detailed 4D representation of the transcriptional signatures
and spatial organization of cell populations and identify potential mechanisms of dysgenesis in coronal CRS. For
Aim 2, by scRNA-seq analysis we have identified a discreet population within the SM that separates the
overlapping frontal and parietal bones of the coronal suture. We will use targeted genetic manipulations to ablate
and fate map this population, and perform lineage differentiation and calvarial defect assays. These experiments
will determine the function of this SM population as a barrier to prevent fusion of adjacent bones and their
potential contribution to suture stem cells. For Aim 3, we have identified a novel coronal suture phenotype in
mutants of Hhip, a HH inhibitor highly expressed in the SM population studied in Aim 2. We will characterize the
Hhip-/- phenotype and combine targeted genetic manipulations of the HH pathway in the SM population with
RNA-seq analysis to comprehensively determine the roles of HH signaling at the level of both transcriptional
programs and cell populations. We will fate map a potential osteoprogenitor population adjacent to the OFs and
regulated by HH signaling. This project will significantly advance our understanding of coronal suturogenesis
and provide insight into disease mechanisms affecting craniofacial development."

The integrative theme for the Center for the Assessment of Tobacco Regulations (CAsToR) is to provide
evidence-based and expert-informed modeling of the behavioral and public health impacts of FDA tobacco
rules or other regulatory actions, focusing on Impact Analysis, Behavior and Health Effects as Scientific
Domains. To evaluate the public health impacts of tobacco use and regulation, information must be gathered
from different sources on tobacco use behaviors, health risks and the impact of regulations on use patterns.
This information must then be synthetized and processed in a systematic and objective manner, helping policy
makers gauge the impact that such regulations would have at the population level and aiding them in their
decision-making process. Simulation modeling of tobacco use patterns and related health outcomes can serve
as a key tool to assist FDA in evaluating and predicting population-level benefits and harms resulting from
regulatory policies pertaining to new and existing tobacco products. When effectively applied, modeling also
becomes a way of organizing and synthesizing different sources of information and identifying gaps in that
information, especially where tobacco use patterns vary for different socio-economic populations. Our Center
will have four projects based on the detailed analyses of current and historical tobacco use patterns in the US
using established tobacco simulation models, with different approaches to provide a range of diverse insights.
The overarching aim of Project 1 (Impact Analysis, Health Effects, and Behavior) is to conduct comparative
modeling of the impact of FDA regulatory actions and novel tobacco products on tobacco use and long-term
health outcomes. Project 2 (Addiction, Behavior, Impact Analysis, and Health Effects) will model the process of
nicotine addiction among youths and young adults and its potential future consequences. Project 3 (Impact
Analysis and Behavior) will develop tools to assess the impact of flavor restrictions on smoking and vaping for
the overall US population and for urban and rural populations. Project 4 (Behavior, Health Effects, and Impact
Analysis) will develop models for vulnerable populations and assess the impact of tobacco use and regulations
by race/ethnicity, education, and their intersection. Four cores will serve the Center: the Administrative Core
(AC) to coordinate the work of the projects and cores; the Career Enhancement Core (CEC) to provide training
to junior investigators on the capabilities and limitations of tobacco regulatory science and simulation modeling;
the Data Analysis and Modeling (DAM) Core to analyze and provide the data for each of the models and
develop infrastructure for dissemination of model parameters and modeling results; and the Policy and
Dissemination (PAD) Core to generate estimates for key policy and health effects, modeling parameters via
systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and expert panels."

Under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is
required to show that any new rule to regulate the marketing, sale or content of tobacco products is
“appropriate for the protection of the public health.” To provide the FDA with a framework to assess the
potential health impacts of tobacco regulations, Project 1 will harmonize and extend well-established Center for
the Assessment of Tobacco Regulations (CAsToR) tobacco control simulation models to examine the impact
of FDA regulatory actions on future trends in cigarette, cigar, electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), and
other novel tobacco product (ONPs) use and associated health outcomes. This project will focus on Behavior
(Aim 1), Impact Analysis (Aims 2 and 3) and Health Effects (Aims 2 and 3) as Scientific Domains (RFA-OD-22-
04). Project 1 has three aims. Aim 1. Characterize longitudinal patterns of use and transitions of
cigarettes, cigars, and ENDS, individually and in combination. Oral nicotine, heated tobacco products
(HTPs), and ONPs will be considered as data on their use become available. Using nationally representative
health surveys, literature reviews and transitions estimates, we will extend a previously developed framework
to examine transitions between regular cigarette and ENDS use to include cigars, HTPs and ONPs. We will
develop transition parameters to distinguish between exclusive, former, dual use and switching patterns for
each product. Aim 2. Develop simulation models of the use patterns of cigarettes, cigars, ENDS, and
other tobacco products in the US and their health implications. We will expand the CAsToR simulation
models (i.e., SimSmoke, Mendez and Warner, Microsimulation and SAVM) to incorporate product use, health
outcomes and all-cause mortality risk of cigars, HTPs, and ONPs. Population transitions in the models will be
modeled through sex- and age-specific initiation and cessation rates for each product and switching rates
between products. Each model will be calibrated and validated against prevalence rates by age and sex from
surveys for each product type. Aim 3. Model the impact of existing and potential regulations on tobacco
use patterns and all-cause mortality associated with cigarette, cigar, ENDS, and other novel tobacco
product use. For all models, we will create the capability to examine how past and future FDA policies will
impact combustible and novel nicotine product use and associated health outcomes. We will develop best
estimates and credible ranges of the policy effect on each product’s initiation, cessation, and switching rates.
We will consider variations in policy effect sizes by age, sex, race, and socioeconomic status. We will initially
focus on the relationship between cigarette and ENDS use, and then incorporate cigar use. Comparative
analyses of the four models’ predictions will be conducted to refine the likely best-case, worst-case, and most
likely projected scenarios to better assess regulatory impacts. The resulting models will have the capacity and
flexibility to rapidly incorporate new data and consider new regulatory policy options as they emerge."

Although the literature on nicotine addiction is extensive, the various mechanisms by which an adolescent is
exposed, experiments, and ultimately becomes addicted to a nicotine product, have not been studied in a
comprehensive manner. There are studies focusing on the biological effects of nicotine on the brain; the social
pressures confronting adolescents; and demographic and environmental factors such as race, gender, social
norms, socioeconomic status, and education, among others. However, no study has investigated how the
interactions among these factors influence an adolescent to start or quit using nicotine. This project proposes
to develop a novel comprehensive agent-based model of nicotine addiction among adolescents and young
adults, including the influence of environmental, social, and biological factors on individuals' behaviors towards
nicotine products (Aim 1). Use the model to explore potential pathways of nicotine addiction among
adolescents and young adults under different nicotine product mix availability, and the short-term
consequences of potential regulatory actions over such products, such as reducing nicotine in combustible
tobacco products to non-addictive levels but allowing higher levels of nicotine in non-combustible nicotine
delivery products (Aim 2). Project the likely long-term consequences of nicotine addiction among adolescents
and young adults, including tobacco-use-attributed premature deaths and life-years-lost, and long-term nicotine
dependence (Aim 3). This project will focus on Addiction, Behavior, Impact Analysis and Health Effects as
Scientific Domains (RFA-OD-22-04)."

The defining morbidity of heart failure (HF) is exercise intolerance, which reduces quality of life despite existing
therapies. Currently, prescribed exercise in the form of cardiac rehabilitation can provide benefit, but is
underutilized, thus there is a need to better understand the molecular transducers responsible for exercise’s
benefit. Evidence suggests that cardiac-specific adaptation to exercise is muted in HF patients, thus peripheral
adaptation at the level of the vasculature is hypothesized to be of increased importance in mediating exercise
benefit. In support of this hypothesis, preliminary data from healthy adults using high-throughput proteomic
profiling demonstrates an association between circulating levels of vascular extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins
and exercise adaptation. Thus, the Research Strategy leverages Olink proteomic profiling before and after
exercise training to test the hypothesis that changes in vascular ECM are associated with exercise adaptation,
particularly among HF patients as compared to healthy adults. In Aim 1, the applicant Dr. Daniel Katz, will
analyze Olink proteomic data from the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) to
elucidate the relationship between vascular ECM proteins, as well as other proteins, and exercise training in
healthy adults. Machine learning techniques will also differentiate molecular adaptation response subtypes. In
Aim 2, 90 HF patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and an ejection fraction < 35% will be randomized to
12 weeks of cardiac rehabilitation vs 12 weeks of no rehabilitation. Exercise testing and plasma samples (for
proteomic profiling) will be obtained before and after the intervention period. The relationship between vascular
ECM proteins, as well as other proteins, and exercise training will be determined and compared to healthy
adults from MoTrPAC. In Aim 3, genetic variants which determine plasma levels for vascular ECM proteins,
and other proteins identified in Aims 1 and 2, will be leveraged for Mendelian Randomization to support a
causal link to cardiovascular health outcomes. Dr. Katz builds on prior proteomic training, and has produced 25
publications (13 as first or co-first author) since 2013. The career development plan will provide new training in
exercise physiology and testing, clinical trials, bioinformatics, machine learning, and genetic causal analysis,
through immersion and course work. Mentor Dr. Euan Ashley is an expert in exercise physiology and training,
genetics, and precision medicine. Co-mentor Dr. Robert Gerszten is an expert in multi-omics, especially Olink
proteomics, and both collaborate on the MoTrPAC proteomic working group. Drs. Matthew Wheeler
(bioinformatics), Jon Myers (exercise testing and trials), and Michael Snyder (exercise biology) offer
complimentary expertise as advisors. Together, the proposed work enhances understanding of exercise
adaptation, and supports future efforts to expand profiling into peripheral tissue samples (e.g. muscle, adipose)
to better understand peripheral exercise adaptation in HF as a therapeutic target, the subject of a planned R01."

Funding Band 4 and Education and Inventory Funding Band 6 of PAR-21-174 to
continue the development and implementation of the FSMA Produce Safety Rule (PSR)
among PA’s produce farms. Under FDA authority, PDA educates, regulates and enforces
the Produce Safety Rule under 21 CFR Part 112 and the FDA Food Safety Modernization
Act (FSMA). This project is designed to encourage the safe production of fresh produce
and promote understanding and compliance with the requirements of the PSR.
Inspections are conducted following the NASDA/FDA guidance document Standardized

implementation were major components of the previous 5-year Cooperative Agreement
and PA continues to build on this previous work to align with the expectations within
the new Cooperative Agreement. PA will provide opportunities for outreach, education
and technical assistance on the PSR to produce farms. The goal is to provide outreach,
education and/or technical assistance to 5,294 produce farms in Pennsylvania by June
30, 2026. Moreover, the target is to conduct 150 OFRR visits in year 1. We plan to have a
complete verified inventory of produce farms in PA by June 30, 2026. We aim to
develop a complete and accurate farm inventory of 6,214 verified produce farms by June
30, 2026. We plan to complete initial inspections of our verified large and small covered

January of 2021 and will continue throughout the upcoming funding period. According
to the target expectations set in PAR-21-174, our goal is to conduct routine inspections
equal to 20% of the current non-exempt covered produce farms in Pennsylvania on an
annual basis. Information sharing with FDA will continue for purposes of the
Compliance and Enforcement Program. We also plan to communicate and deploy, when
needed, produce safety staff for all produce related incidents as part of our Produce
Related Event Response Planning and Implementation Program. Overall, the funding
from PAR-21-174 will focus on quality and national consistency to ensure the
Department is protecting the public health of consumers by minimizing the risk of
foodborne illness associated with produce covered under the Produce Safety Rule."

 The rate of diversification of the scientific workforce has been extraordinarily slow despite efforts of
thousands of individuals and large financial investments from government and private agencies over the past
4+ decades. In particular, faculty diversity in biomedical and other natural sciences has not changed to any
meaningful degree. Most research to address this problem has focused early in the pipeline, on ways to
improve retention in college STEM majors, a sense of belonging in STEM fields, and entry into PhD programs.
Modest success has been achieved in entry of students from underrepresented (UR) ethnic and racial groups,
and women into biomedical PhD training. However, these changes have not led to any real improvement in UR
or gender diversity at the faculty level. Single time, cross-sectional survey studies have shed some light on this
seemingly intractable problem, but they are limited by recall bias and lack the capacity to explain the
complexity of individuals’ experiences over time. Our research combines two research streams aiming to fully
understand experiences and career intentions of biomedical scientists: 1) through a large-scale, empirical
study beginning in 2008, “The National Longitudinal Study of Young Life Scientists,” we are following the
experiences and decision-making of a diverse group of biomedical PhD students from the start of the PhD; 2)
with translational research beginning in 2011, “The Academy for Future Science Faculty,” we implemented
a randomized controlled trial of a novel group coaching model to augment uneven mentoring and address the
isolation faced by young UR scientists. Both are prospective qualitative studies using annual, in-depth, one-on-
one interviews. We have drawn on multiple social science theories for interim analyses with sub-groups of
students. The great majority have completed the PhD; for the first time, we have revealed the great fluidity of
career intentions during training. With continuing interviews, we are poised to follow them into their careers.
 The combined studies are unprecedented in their scope and duration. As of January 1, 2020, we continue
to engage 289 young scientists who have begun, or are still on a path towards, an academic career. Of this
number, 116 (40%) are UR individuals and 170 (59%) are women. Analysis of interview data has provided new
insights into the complexity of career intentions during the PhD. The next 5 years of interviews will reveal how
career intentions change during postdoctoral training; factors that influence those intentions; and, for the first
time, prospective insights on what leads to achievement and success in academic careers. The diversity of the
study population will allow detailed comparison across racial/ethnic groups and gender. Our emerging model
from the data shows how elements and integration of several social science theories will explain the lower
likelihood that individuals from UR groups will choose and persist in academic careers. With inclusion of the
Academy participants, we will be able to study the long-term effects of this novel intervention and identify
features and aspects that can be translated to student support and diversity efforts."

We discovered that NPM1, a required Bax chaperone, promotes regulated cell death and acute kidney injury
(AKI) in the ischemic human kidney. The structure-function relationships (SAR) of NPM1 and its site of interaction
with Bax are unknown, limiting the development of novel drugs to prevent NPM/Bax toxicity in kidney cells that
are vulnerable to ischemic injury. Our integrative, cross disciplinary strategy combines cell biology with structural
and medicinal chemistry to identify the features that render NPM toxic to kidney cells and localize the NPM
domain responsible for binding Bax. Using protein structural analysis with x-ray crystallography, photo-labeling
and cross-linking, we will optimize a novel Bax peptide for preventing and treating ischemic AKI in high risk
cardiac surgery patients. In three aims, we will: (1) Characterize NPM structural features that cause regulated
renal cell death; (2) Optimize drug design to inhibit NPM:Bax interaction, and (3) Select an effective therapeutic
to prevent NPM:Bax toxicity in vitro and AKI in vivo. Prior validation of NPM’s causal role in ischemic injury in
the human kidney and its conserved regulation during ischemic cell death across divergent species substantially
increase the likelihood of translating our novel therapeutics to the clinic. Our scientific team has the combined
expertise in regulated cell death, clinical and experimental AKI, peptide and assay design, x-ray crystallography,
and mass spectrometry to advance our mechanistic understanding of ischemic cell death during AKI, identify
targets and novel drugs for pre-clinical study, and potentially change the standard-of care for AKI patients."

Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a disease of malignant CD4+ T cells that develops in human T-
lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1) carriers. The 3-yr overall survival is an abysmal 25% even when managed with
the most aggressive chemotherapy. No outcome-changing targeted treatment currently exists. Thus, improved
understanding of pathogenesis and novel therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. We and others have shown
that ATLLs diagnosed in the Japanese (J-ATLL) and North American (NA-ATLL) patients have very different
clinical behavior, with the North American variant characterized by a higher rate of chemo-refractory disease and
worse prognosis. Recently, we performed the first targeted exon sequencing analysis in 30 patients seen at our
center and discovered significantly more mutations in genes controlling epigenetic modifications and fewer
mutations in the TCR/NF-kappaB signaling pathways than the Japanese ATLLs. Strikingly, the frequency of
EP300 mutations in our patient cohort (20%) was about 4 times that seen in the Japanese cohort (5.7%). One
of the transcription factors that can be acetylated by p300 is BCL6, a transcription repressor that critically controls
many functional aspects of mature B and T cells. We have discovered for the first time that BCL6 is expressed
in primary ATLL samples and ATLL cell lines. Interestingly, NA-ATLL cell lines are notably more sensitive than
J-ATLL cell lines to BCL6 inhibition. Additional experiments suggest that in NA-ATLL cells, BCL6 plays an
essential role enabling survival of NA-ATLL cells as they cope with elevated DNA replication stress during S-
phase of the cell cycle. Supporting the concept that the S-phase is an Achilles’ heel of NA-ATLL cells, these cells
but not the J-ATLL cells are exquisitely sensitive to a PARP inhibitor, Olaparib. These findings support our
working hypothesis that dysregulated epigenetic program is a central feature of NA-ATLL biology and that
attenuated p300 activity combined with a unique role of BCL6 in S-phase programs provides a novel opportunity
for therapeutic targeting. The following three specific aims are proposed to test this hypothesis.
Aim 1. Elucidate the mechanisms by which p300 regulates chromatin and gene expression in NA-ATLL.
Aim 2. Characterize the roles of p300 and BCL6 as regulators of DNA replication program and genome stability
in NA-ATLL.

 T cell exit from a site of inflammation plays key roles in the immune response. At the effector phase of
an immune response, T cell exit has been reported to limit tissue inflammation. By contrast, periodic T cell exit
from a site of chronic inflammation might prevent T cell exhaustion and sustain the immune response. As memory
develops, T cell exit from a site of inflammation limits the formation of resident memory T cells. Whether the T
cells that have exited the tissue become a unique form of circulating memory cells is unknown. Overall, while
the function of resident memory T cells remaining at a site of inflammation is increasingly well understood, the
function of cells that have left a site of inflammation remains unclear.
 One cue that regulates T cell exit from a site of inflammation is the signaling lipid sphingosine 1-
phosphate (S1P). Generally, S1P levels are high in lymph compared to tissues, and S1P guides immune cells
out of tissues into lymphatics. This paradigm has been well-established for T cell exit from lymph nodes into
efferent lymphatics, and some studies indicate that it holds for T cell exit from non-lymphoid tissues into lymph.
Yet we do not understand how S1P gradients are shaped in non-lymphoid tissues during an immune response,
or how S1P might interact with other cues that might guide T cell exit from non-lymphoid tissues.
 A key barrier to answering these questions is our inability to manipulate gene expression with spatial
specificity. Thus, we cannot permanently mark T cells at a site of inflammation and follow them through a memory
response. Similarly, we cannot disrupt genes that regulate chemotactic cues only at a site of inflammation,
avoiding confounding effects on T cell development and differentiation in the thymus and lymph nodes.
Conditional gene targeting allows manipulation of gene expression in a cell-type specific and, in some models,
inducible manner. However, all murine targeting approaches are currently limited to altering gene expression in
entire lineages, and it is not possible to institute permanent changes in cells within a specific location in the
animal. To address this problem, we have generated a mouse expressing a light-inducible Cre recombinase (LI-
Cre), which allows us to alter gene expression in cells of interest in a location-specific and time-specific manner
using blue light.
 In this grant, we will take advantage of this novel mouse model to answer key questions about the
regulation and function of T cell exit from inflamed skin. We will address how S1P receptor 1 cooperates with
other candidate exit receptors in two well-defined models of disease, ask how S1P gradients change in the skin
during the course of disease, and track the fate of T cells that have exited the skin in the memory phase and in
recall responses."
10806175,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal seeks to understand the cardioprotective effects of a new noncoding RNA (ncRNA) entity, TY4,
that is bioinspired by the contents of exosomes. Our focus is on one class of small ncRNA, not previously
recognized as particularly relevant to cardiac disease. Y RNAs captured our attention because molecules
encoded by the YRNA4 gene are exceptionally plentiful in exosomes secreted by cardiosphere-derived cells.
The predominant such ncRNA, EV-YF1, has salutary properties when delivered on its own: EV-YF1 increases
IL-10 secretion, is cardioprotective and anti-hypertrophic. Here we present preliminary data on TY4, a new
chemical entity (NCE) bioinspired by EV-YF1. TY4 exerts global transcriptomic changes involving inflammatory
and fibrotic pathways, and exerts disease-modifying bioactivity in murine models of heart failure with preserved
ejection fraction, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and MI. Remarkably, TY4, when formulated with the breast milk
protein casein, works orally in all three models. In terms of mechanism, preliminary data show that TY4 binds to
TPR, a nuclear pore complex protein that acts as a gatekeeper for messenger RNA export from the nucleus. We
have also found that macrophage depletion abrogates TY4-mediated cardioprotection. As a small chemically-
modified mutant NCE, TY4 has key features desirable in a synthetic RNA drug. But other RNA drugs, whether
FDA-approved or in development, all have known mechanisms of action: they are antisense oligos, small
interfering RNAs, aptamers, or miR-modifiers. TY4 fits into none of those classes and thus is the prototype for a
new class of RNA drugs. The focus here is on understanding the mechanism whereby TY4 limits infarct size.
We will test the following mechanistic hypothesis: TY4 is cardioprotective against MI by binding to TPR and
altering gene expression in target cells (and specifically, in macrophages). We will pursue the following Aims: 1:
Investigate the mechanism(s) whereby TY4 alters gene expression in macrophages. Sub-aims seek to
identify TY4 binding partners, characterize the transcriptomic changes induced by TY4, and prioritize biological
targets for further interrogation. 2: Optimize in vivo efficacy of oral TY4 in murine MI. Sub-aims seek to
optimize the dosage paradigm for oral TY4 in acute MI, measure biodistribution of TY4 after oral delivery in mice
pre- and post- acute MI, determine the window of opportunity for TY4 efficacy post-MI in acute MI, test TY4
cardioprotective efficacy in aged mice, and characterize the effects of optimized oral TY4 delivery in a chronic
MI model. 3: Test whether macrophages are necessary and sufficient to explain TY4 efficacy in acute MI.
Sub-aims seek to compare MI outcomes +/- TY4 with and without prior macrophage depletion, probe the relative
roles of tissue-resident versus circulating macrophages, and determine whether post-MI adoptive transfer of ex
vivo TY4-conditioned macrophages reduces infarct size in macrophage-depleted mice. While highly mechanistic,
our proposal, focusing on a synthetic ncRNA NCE bioinspired by exosomal cargo, also offers translational value
in its development of a novel cardioprotective agent that is effective even when given after reperfusion."
10806187,"The underlying molecular mechanisms for heart failure (HF) are multifactorial, with energy
dysregulation and oxidative stress appearing to be the key causes. The well-balanced energy
consumption/generation of the working heart is thought to be achieved by Ca2+ entry via
mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) which stimulates enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
cycle for ATP generation, referred to as excitation-bioenergetics (EB) coupling. Surprisingly,
knockout of MCU in the heart results in minimal defects in bioenergetics, suggesting that other
Ca2+ transporters also may participate in EB coupling. We have previously shown that ryanodine
receptor type 1 (RyR1) is expressed in cardiac mitochondria (mRyR1), playing a key role in EB
coupling. Several groups have confirmed our findings, including recent reports showing that Ca2+
release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is tunneled to mRyR to stimulate ATP production.
We have also obtained new data showing that RyR1 expression is increased in mouse and human
hypertrophied heart. The mitochondria isolated from RyR1 over expression (OE) mouse hearts
have higher Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]m) and increased ROS generation. This RyR1 OE mouse
also shows cardiac hypertrophy and higher frequency of Ca2+ sparks, suggesting leakier RyR2
for Ca2+. Taken together, we propose a novel central hypothesis: Hypertrophic stimuli lead to
mRyR1 overexpression in heart to compensate for increased energy demands by promoting
mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake for EB coupling (Aim 1). However, chronic increases in mitochondrial
Ca2+ uptake causes a sustained high level of ROS generation via Rieske iron-sulfur protein (RISP)
at complex III (Aim 2). The increased ROS would oxidize and thus activate nearby SR RyR2
further increase mitochondrial Ca2+ loading due to constant Ca2+ leak from SR. This vicious cycle
of ↑mRyR1→↑[Ca2+]m→↑ROS→↑SR RyR2 Ca2+ leak→↑[Ca2+]m (→: leads to, ↑: increases), which
causes mitochondrial dysfunction including opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore.
Consequently, the heart is failing because of the inadequate energy for pumping and higher
myocyte death and injury (Aim 3). The successful research outcome from this proposal will
provide a new paradigm for HF: that RyR1 OE in the stressed heart is an initial adaptive
mechanism that sequentially become mal-adaptive, which subsequently leads to HF. This new
information will highlight a potentially innovative therapeutic strategy for development of novel
inhibitors that are more selective for RyR1 than for RyR2 – such as dantrolene which has already
been frequently used for treating malignant hyperthermia patients – as effective treatments of
cardiac hypertrophy and HF."
10839420,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Endometriosis burdens ~11% of women and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality
among US women. Women who have a history of endometriosis may be at increased risk of chronic diseases,
including CVD due to higher levels of inflammation, greater risk of hypertension, and greater risk for
hyperlipidemia. A few studies have shown higher risk of coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease
for those with endometriosis; however, studies have been limited by short follow-up (<10 years) or small,
cross-sectional design. In addition, prior studies have not incorporated information on endometriosis subtypes
or reproductive history (i.e., infertility, adverse pregnancy outcomes), all of which may alter CVD risk. Thus,
there are significant gaps in our knowledge regarding the complex association between endometriosis and
CVD. The proposed research will leverage data from two existing cohorts—a well-phenotyped research cohort
embedded within a large representative population cohort—to investigate the relationship between
endometriosis and risk of clinical and subclinical CVD. Specifically, we will analyze data from the Utah
Population Database (Population Cohort) and the NICHD ENDO study (Research Cohort). The Population
Cohort comprises electronic health records and vital statistics of >80,000 women with endometriosis matched
1:5 by birth year and birthplace to women with no history of endometriosis and has up to 32 years of follow-up
to allow for the development of clinical CVD. The Research Cohort comprises 506 women who were assessed
for endometriosis between 2007 and 2009; 184 women were diagnosed with endometriosis. Participants in the
NICHD ENDO study will be re-contacted and screened for CVD risk factors and subclinical CVD markers
during a new clinical visit. Leveraging both the Population Cohort and the Research Cohort, we will determine
whether women with a history of endometriosis have an increased risk of a composite CVD outcome, and
components of composite CVD outcome, including incident cardiovascular events, chronic hypertension,
metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and chronic kidney disease compared to women without a
history of endometriosis (Aim 1). We will also determine if risk of composite CVD outcome and components of
composite vary by endometriosis subtype (deep infiltrating, endometriomas, superficial) (Aim 2). Via our ENDO
Follow-Up Study we will determine if endometriosis increases risk of subclinical CVD, measured by CVD risk
scores, cardiac CT scans, and brain MRIs compared to those without endometriosis (Aim 3). Finally, we will
determine if endometriosis mediates the relationship between young adult atherogenic profile and mid-life CVD
(Aim 4). The proposed project provides an unprecedented opportunity to rigorously investigate endometriosis
and risk for clinical and subclinical CVD, and the role that a woman’s underlying predisposition to CVD plays in
the endometriosis–CVD link. Our study findings may help inform women’s professional health guidelines in the
prevention, screening, early detection, and treatment of CVD risk factors among women with endometriosis."
10936513,"Project Summary/Abstract:
The most reliable predictor of fracture risk is a previous fracture at any skeletal site. The etiology of this
relationship is not fully known, but one contributing mechanism is that fracture initiates a systemic bone loss
response, which increases future fracture risk at all skeletal sites. Our lab has generated multiple preclinical
studies characterizing this systemic bone loss response following femur fracture in mice. However, the time
course and magnitude of systemic bone loss and recovery in humans has not been investigated, and it is
currently unknown if systemic bone loss differentially affects older people compared to young people. To address
these knowledge gaps, we will use both standard clinical and cutting-edge high-resolution imaging to
characterize the systemic bone loss response following a humerus fracture in human subjects. We hypothesize
that post-fracture systemic bone loss: 1) will persist for 6 months or more after a humerus fracture followed by
partial recovery, 2) will have a greater effect on trabecular bone than on cortical bone, and 3) will have delayed
and diminished recovery in older subjects relative to younger subjects. To investigate these hypotheses, we will
first determine the time course and magnitude of systemic bone mineral density (BMD) loss and recovery
following humerus fracture in young (20-40 years old) and old (60-80 years old) human patients at axial and
appendicular skeletal sites (lumbar spine, bilateral hips, tibiae, and forearms) at baseline, 3, 6, 18, and 36 months
post-fracture and compare these patients to non-fractured control subjects. At each time point we will also
investigate mechanisms of systemic bone loss by measuring serum biomarkers of bone remodeling and
inflammation and tracking patient physical activity using accelerometers. Next, we will determine microstructural
and biomechanical changes in the trabecular and cortical compartments during systemic bone loss and recovery
following fracture in the same patients and how these differ by age. Using clinical quantitative computed
tomography (QCT) and high-resolution peripheral QCT (HR-pQCT) at the ipsilateral and contralateral proximal
femur, tibia, and radius, we will measure trabecular and cortical density and microstructure and use finite element
analysis to estimate mechanical properties of bone. Altogether, these novel studies will reveal that systemic
bone loss and recovery following fracture: 1) occurs in human patients similar to what we have shown in mice,
but on a much longer timeline, 2) has differential effects at axial vs. appendicular skeletal sites and in trabecular
vs. cortical bone, and 3) affects older people differently than younger people, potentially leaving older subjects
with permanent deficits in bone mass and strength. The findings from these studies may ultimately help us
identify mechanisms of systemic bone loss following fracture, and will inform therapeutic strategies and establish
windows of opportunity for preserving skeletal health of patients after a fracture."

Human long-lived plasma cells (LLPC) reside in the bone marrow (BM) and are responsible for the long-term

transform early-minted antibody secreting cells (ASC) into LLPC for which CD138 and BCMA - a member of
the TNF receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) - play an important role. In this application, we explore old and new
CD138 binding factors in the BM microniche and long-established and newly discovered TNFRSF members in
the development of LLPC, as well as understanding how modulating the high energy function of antibody

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States, and obesity, which
affects 40% of the population, not only increases the risk of developing CRC, but also increases CRC mortality
through unknown mechanisms. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that CRC grows faster in mice rendered
obese through a high fat diet (HFD), and that the tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) in these mice exhibit
higher expression of the acid sensing receptor, GPR65, which is known to dampen the immune response.
Moreover, in HFD-induced obese mice lacking GRP65, TAMs secrete more TNF-α and tumor growth is retarded.
Given that TAMs but not normal tissue macrophages of obese mice exhibit increased GPR65, we examined the
pH of the tumors in these mice and found them to be more acidic. On the basis of these findings, we hypothesize
that excess lipids in the HFD alter tumor cell metabolism resulting in increased acid production, which potentiates
GPR65 expression and signaling in TAMs, causing them to become immunosuppressive and promote tumor
growth. To test this hypothesis we will pursue the following specific aims: 1) Determine the contribution of
GPR65 signaling to TAM function and CRC growth under conditions of obesity by determining if the cAMP-
PKA signaling axis, which functions downstream of GPR65, is activated in TAMs of obese mice and controls
TNF-α production. We will also analyze GPR65 expression and the cytokine secretion capacity of macrophages
from healthy blood donors and TAMs in CRC samples from non-obese and obese patients; 2) Identify the
mechanism by which HFD promotes GPR65 signaling in CRC TAMs by testing the ability of HFD and oleic
acid, a dietary triglyceride that is highly enriched in HFD tumors, to alter the oxidative potential, fatty acid
oxidation capacity and acid production of human tumor cells via flow cytometry, CyTOF and Seahorse assays.
We will also determine if a high-oleic-acid diet is sufficient to modify GPR65 expression and cytokine production
by TAMs, and examine if tumor acidity is required for the blunted inflammatory response of TAMs; and verify the
role of GPR65 in human macrophages and 3) Assess the effects of targeting GPR65 for tumor
immunotherapy in obese and nonobese mice with CRC and other tumor types, namely hepatocellular
carcinoma and melanoma, and assess the effects of checkpoint blocking antibodies on tumor growth and anti-
tumor immunity in GPR65+ and GPR-/- mice bearing these tumors. The results of these studies are expected to
not only reveal a critical mechanism responsible for accelerated tumor growth in the setting of obesity, but also
identify a novel target for the treatment of these cancers."

Schistosomiasis is endemic in 54 countries and infects nearly 240 million people worldwide per year. Sub-
Saharan Africa endures a disproportionate burden, accounting for over 90% of infections. In Kenya, the site of
our study, 17 million out of the nation’s 50 million citizens are at risk for schistosomiasis infection. Of the at-risk
population, school-aged children represent the primary risk group, and the many morbidities of infection are
amplified over a child’s lifespan.
After decades of mass drug administration, it is clear that more aggressive and targeted interventions are
necessary to move towards the elimination of schistosomiasis. Unfortunately, this recognition has not yet
resulted in the development of the tools that public health officials need to make this transition. To address this
unmet need, we propose the development of the MEDSCAN (mobile enabled diagnostics for schistosomiasis
control analytics) platform to improve schistosomiasis surveillance efforts. This software package builds off of
the successful history that we have had in the development of image-processing algorithms for diagnostic
purposes. MEDSCAN will consist of a mobile application that can analyze point-of-care diagnostic tests and a
web-based administrator dashboard for viewing real-time operational performance metrics and other advanced
analytics.
We have assembled an interdisciplinary consortium that consists of mobile health software and global
health expertise at Vanderbilt University, a world-leader in schistosomiasis diagnostics from Leiden University
Medical Center, and a successful history of neglected tropical disease program management and field
research at the Kenya Medical Research Institute. To meet our shared goals, our specific aims will: 1) evaluate
the cellular network in Western Kenya in preparation for mobile health research, and develop the mobile and
web platforms; 2) perform a usability analysis on the platform and make iterative refinements; 3) complete a
thorough laboratory evaluation of the MEDSCAN application and a single-site pilot systems check; 4) use the
MEDSCAN platform in a 10-month, observational surveillance study.
By transforming the already widely utilized point-of-care test into a “connected” diagnostic, MEDSCAN can
serve as the gateway to high-resolution surveillance that is necessary to shift efforts from control to elimination."

Clearance of cellular debris from the degenerating central nervous system (CNS) white matter is inefficient.
Debris accumulation, especially from myelin, precipitates maladaptive neuroinflammation which furthers disease
progression and prevents repair. Chronic white matter degeneration that produces cellular debris and protracted
innate immune inflammation is a hallmark of diverse disorders, including traumatic and ischemic CNS injury and
Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The development of therapies aimed enhancing debris clearance to promote repair is
thereby of broad translational relevance. Research aimed at uncovering central regulatory mechanisms
underlying the inflammatory response that facilitates debris clearance after white matter insult is therefore
prudent and necessary. The overarching objective of this research is to dissect molecular pathways of astrocyte-
microglia interaction that govern pro-restorative CNS innate immune responses to white matter degeneration.
The present research will investigate a newly identified mechanism of intercellular communication, through which
a distinct subpopulation of white matter degeneration-reactive astrocytes regulate microglia specification and
function required for the removal of inflammatory myelin debris and tissue repair. In Aim 1, we will use a
transgenic, cell type-specific loss-of-function system, single-nucleus RNA-Sequencing (snRNA-Seq) and mouse
models of acute and chronic white matter degeneration to assess the involvement of this unique astrocyte-
mediated signaling pathway in regulating damage-responsive microglia specification required for myelin debris
clearance and remyelination. In Aim 2, we will dissect the direct effects and receptor dependent mechanism of
action for a novel astrocyte-derived molecular cue on microglia molecular profile, motility, and capacity for myelin
debris phagocytosis using cultures of mouse primary and human iPSC-derived microglia. In Aim 3, we will
determine cell-intrinsic regulatory pathways underlying molecularly and functionally distinct states of white matter
astrocyte reactivity using cell-paired snRNA-Seq and single-nucleus Assay for Transposase-Accessible
Chromatin using Sequencing (snATAC-Seq), over time, in a mouse model of chronic white matter degeneration.
An integrative analysis pipeline will be used to generate gene regulatory programs of astrocyte reactivity,
including dynamic changes in chromatin structure and context-specific combinations of transcriptional regulators
(TR), which together govern genetic accessibility and distinct reactive changes in transcriptomic profile. Select
TR of molecularly distinct states of white matter astrocyte reactivity will be functionally interrogated in vivo by
loss-of-function studies. Together, this research will enhance the understanding of how astrocyte-microglia
interactions shape CNS innate immune responses that enable white matter repair. These data may also inform
new therapeutic avenues for harnessing restorative innate immune responses, involving astrocytes and
microglia, to prevent or attenuate maladaptive white matter inflammation, as well as improve outcome and
promote recovery after CNS injury and in disease."

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an eye disease leading to permanent central vision loss. Our prior
work focused on using optical coherence tomographic angiography (OCTA) in the diagnosis and management
of choroidal neovascularization (CNV), the characteristic feature of exudative AMD. Our clinical studies have
shown OCTA has high sensitivity and specificity for CNV detection when evaluated by clinicians and artificial
intelligence; we have developed novel CNV quantitative metrics to monitor treatment response; and, have shown
OCTA can identify non-exudative CNV that carries a high risk for developing exudation. Though exudative AMD
is treatable, many eyes under treatment will lose vision due to developing advanced dry AMD, characterized by
geographic atrophy (GA). There is great interest in using OCTA to detect perfusion defects in the choriocapillaris
and retinal DCP that could serve as biomarkers for eyes at risk for developing advanced AMD prior to vision
loss. We will accomplish these goals with the following aims and evaluations: Aim 1: Improve imaging of the
choriocapillaris and deep capillary plexus (DCP). Our high-speed swept-source (SS)-OCT prototype has
shown superior resolution compared to other OCTA devices. However, several issues currently still prevent clean
visualization of deep vascular layers on 9×9-mm scans at the central macula. We will address these issues by
optimizing scan sampling density, improving the OCTA computation algorithm, and developing a new projection
resolution algorithm that is effective in these layers. Aim 2: Develop quantitative analysis of choriocapillaris
and deep capillary plexus perfusion defects. Imaging capillaries in deeper anatomic layers is difficult due to
signal attenuation and background noise. To compensate for these effects, we will improve avascular area
measurements by including a capillary reconstruction strategy in the pre-processing steps. We will also develop
a novel flow defect measurement by combining the structural OCT and OCTA signals that will be able to identify
non-perfused capillary segments. Aim 3: Evaluate advanced OCTA for AMD in clinical studies. Three clinical
studies will test three advanced OCTA-derived biomarkers: choriocapillaris avascular area, DCP avascular
areas, and non-perfused capillary length in the DCP. (1) Conduct a cross-sectional study to determine if the
advanced OCTA biomarkers are associated with increasingly advanced stages of AMD. (2) Conduct a
longitudinal study that evaluates eyes with intermediate AMD to determine if advanced OCTA biomarkers can
identify eyes at risk factors for developing advanced AMD. (3) Conduct a longitudinal study of eyes with exudative
AMD under treatment, to determine if the advanced OCTA biomarkers will predict eyes at risk for developing
GA. If successful, OCTA will enable a better understanding of the role of choriocapillaris and DCP in AMD
pathogenesis and will help predict eyes at risk for developing advanced AMD. The innovations presented here
will allow OCTA technology to fulfill its potential by providing highly detailed images and measurements of
vasculature throughout the retina and choriocapillaris."

produce; assure producer competitiveness in the marketplace; and establish a unified partnership with FDA
to achieve an integrated food safety system.
Updated State law and rules have been developed, and legislatively approved, giving DAMF authority to
implement and enforce an inspection program, which verifies relevant stakeholders’ compliance to the FSMA
Produce Safety Rule (PSR). Agency laws and rules are publically available for produce growers covered under
the PSR.
Subject to sufficient federal funding, DAMF has legal authority to enforce the Food Safety Modernization Act,
Public Law 111-353, codified at 21 U.S.C. section 301 et seq., for standards of growing, harvesting, packing,
and holding of produce for human consumption, 21 C.F.R. Part 112, as incorporated by reference including
any subsequent amendments thereto.
(See links to State Law and Rules below)
Currently, DAMF has not conducted any sprout inspections under Subpart M of the PSR.
The Produce Safety Program (PSP) includes qualified inspection staff, possessing knowledge, and skills to
address state and federal FSMA regulations as defined by FSMA inspection protocols, tools and other relevant
practices.
DAMF’s PSP program provides educational and technical assistance to produce farmers covered under the
rule, and robust training of regulators.
FDA’s current CAP funding opportunity PAR-21-17, if awarded, would allow DAMF to continue developing the
program manual with procedures, policies and SOPs, that effectively establish a well-defined and strong
produce safety inspection program.

Some of the most important new and (re)emerging pathogens are positive-strand RNA viruses,
including coronavirus and picornaviruses Enterovirus D68, Enterovirus A71 and even poliovirus.
These viruses can directly use their RNA genome to guide the synthesis of a large polyprotein, which
must then be proteolyzed into its component parts, including the capsid proteins and enzymes
important for genome replication and encapsidation. Virus RNA genomes are rather small, and so
these viruses have evolved strategies to essentially expand their functional proteomes. For example,
the picornavirus 3C protein is a multi-functional protein that has protease activity, binds RNA control
sequences important for coordinating replication and translation processes, and binds
phosphoinositide lipids found in virus “replication organelles”, which act to protect the virus from host
cell defenses. All of these activities are encoded within its small 20 kDa structure. Another strategy to
expand functional protein content is for proteolytic precursors to have different functions than their
fully processed counterparts. For example, 3C is also found as part of the 3CD protein, but the 3CD
protein has different protease specificity, and different RNA and lipid binding affinities. The 3CD
protein also has a 3D domain; the 3D protein is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase but 3CD does
not possess polymerase activity. By itself, 3CD also upregulates phosphoinositide lipid production
and induces membrane proliferation, events important for replication organelle biogenesis. How the
different and emergent functions of 3CD arise is poorly understood; X-ray crystal structures indicate
that 3CD is merely a composite of the 3C and 3D proteins joined together by a small flexible linker.
We propose that structural dynamics, that is, the ability to sample multiple structural conformations, is
the missing ingredient in understanding virus protein function. We propose that 3C fluctuates among
many conformations, providing 3C the ability to access and coordinate its many functions, and we
propose that 3CD fluctuates into different conformations, providing it with alternative functions. These
dynamic excursions can be further modified by interactions with RNA, lipids and protein binding
partners to coordinate virus protein function. We will evaluate these protein structural dynamics
through solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which provide atomic-level detail of
protein motions from the picosecond to second timescales, and complement these studies with
mutagenesis studies, functional assays and cell-based approaches to better understand the roles of
protein structural dynamics in the virus life cycle. The completed work will provide new opportunities
for rational anti-viral strategies, for example, by finding molecules that bind to alternative protein
conformations and/or disrupt functionally-important motions, as already validated for 3D."
10885036,"ALDH1L1, a common enzyme in folate metabolism, converts 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (10-formyl-THF) to tetrahydrofolate (THF). This reaction is known to regulate the de novo purine biosynthesis and folate-dependent homocysteine re-methylation cycle. It could also play a key role in controlling the flux of one-carbon groups to anabolic pathways. In support of the role in the regulation of folate metabolism, we have recently shown that the loss of the ALDH1L1 gene in knockout mice causes functional folate deficiency, even when the mice had sufficient folate intake. Analysis of Aldh1l1 knockout mice also showed that the enzyme is the main regulator of glycine metabolism in the liver: KO mice have lower levels of glycine and glycine conjugates, indicating that the enzyme is involved in the folate-dependent synthesis of glycine from serine. We have further reported that human ALDH1L1 has six common non-synonymous exonic SNPs at the polymorphic loci rs3796191, rs2886059, rs9282691, rs2276724, rs1127717 and rs4646750 with the occurrence of haplotypes associated with these SNPs being remarkably different between ethnic populations. Our analysis of an established cohort of Hispanic children, Viva La Familia, has shown a significant reduction of serum glycine and increase in serine/glycine ratio in children with rs2276724 and rs3796191, indicating deregulation of serine to glycine conversion and re- capitulating our mouse findings. ALDH1L1 non-synonymous SNPs were also associated with markers of metabolic stress and adiposity in this cohort. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that non-synonymous ALDH1L1 SNPs produce enzyme variants with altered catalytic activity and/or stability that affects their ability to metabolize 10-formyl-THF and thus deregulates glycine metabolism. Accordingly, individuals with specific haplotypes have different ratios of THF/10-formyl-THF and serine/glycine, and altered levels of glycine and its conjugates, with perturbations in the metabotype representing a signature of metabolic health. This proposal will address the question of how haplotype-specific ALDH1L1 variants affect folate metabolism and the overall cellular metabotype, and how the haplotype-specific effect is modified by folate supplementation, by pursuing the following specific aims. Aim 1. Functionally characterize the ALDH1L1 enzyme variants from common human haplotypes. Aim 2. Determine the impact of major ALDH1L1 haplotypes on cellular metabolism and haplotype- specific responses to various folate supplementations. Aim 3. Link ALDH1L1 haplotypes to the folate-dependent regulation of glycine metabolism and health outcomes in humans. ALDH1L1 variants are very common in different populations but their role in folate homeostasis and in the etiology of metabolic disease is largely unexplored. It is expected that ALDH1L1 haplotypes differently mediate the metabolic response to dietary folate that might require adjustments of folate intake for individuals bearing certain ALDH1L1 SNPs. By filling this knowledge gap, the proposed research will provide mechanistic insight into the metabolic regulation by ALDH1L1 SNPs and will lay ground for the evaluation of population-specific ALDH1L1 haplotypes as a disease risk factor."

This is an application for a Maximizing Investigator’s Research Award (MIRA) submitted by the Early Stage
Investigator (ESI), Dr. Alex Walsh. Dr. Walsh’s research program focuses on the characterization and
development of autofluorescence lifetime microscopy for the quantification of cell metabolism and mitochondria
function of living cells. Abnormal cell metabolism and mitochondria dysfunction is a hallmark of many diseases
and pathological states. Furthermore, many drugs and pharmacological agents, including anesthesia, either
have direct mechanisms of action through altered metabolism signaling or indirect toxicities due to impaired
mitochondria function. Current research assays to evaluate cellular metabolism include cell-based assays such
genomic, metabolomic, and oxygen-consumption assays and whole-body imaging assays such as
fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography and carbon-13 magnetic resonance imaging. However,
these existing tools have limited spatial and temporal resolutions and the label-dependent nature of the assays
prevents assessment of dynamic metabolic states and multiple longitudinal assessments of the same samples.
Autofluorescence lifetime imaging of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) within the mitochondria
and cytosol and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) within mitochondria presents a unique, label-free, high-
resolution technique to evaluate cell metabolism. Autofluorescence lifetime microscopy is not dependent on
chemical or antibody labels, is non-contact, broadly applicable to any cell or tissue, well-suited for longitudinal
studies, and compatible with secondary assays. However, adoption of autofluorescence lifetime is currently
hindered by the advanced expertise needed to design and perform fluorescence lifetime experiments, obscurity
in the correlation between fluorescence lifetime metrics and molecular specificity, and a lack of robust models to
determine metabolic phenotype and mitochondria function from autofluorescence features. Therefore, Dr.
Walsh’s goals for the next five years will address these limitations. Goal 1: Determine the sensitivity and
specificity of autofluorescence lifetime imaging to identify cellular metabolic states and pathway utilization. Goal
2: Quantify autofluorescence lifetime imaging features across common lab models to determine the robustness
of autofluorescence metrics to report cellular metabolism. Goal 3: Develop, test, and optimize autofluorescence
imaging protocols to quantify mitochondria dynamics and function. The outcomes of this proposal will enable
metabolic measurements with high temporal resolution and specificity to evaluate cellular metabolism in living
cells. Additionally, autofluorescence imaging will provide a platform to evaluate the impacts of drug and
pharmacological agents, including anesthetics, on cell metabolism and mitochondria function in living cells,
tissues, and in vivo."
10840350,"PROJECT SUMMARY: HIV incidence doubles during pregnancy and postpartum period compared with non-
pregnant women, underscoring the urgent need for prevention interventions tailored to high-risk
pregnant and breastfeeding women. Incident maternal HIV infections lead to an estimated one-third of all
infant HIV infections. South Africa expects over 76,000 infant HIV cases in the next decade; one-third of those
can be prevented by eliminating maternal HIV acquisition. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in pregnancy and
breastfeeding is safe and effective at preventing HIV. However, PrEP use remains low in pregnancy, and drops
precipitously in the postpartum period. Our team is made up of experts in epidemiology, behavioral science,
health economics and HIV prevention in pregnant women from University of California Los Angeles and the
University of Cape Town. Together we have implemented one of the first studies to integrate PrEP into
antenatal care in South Africa (“PrEP-PP”; R01MH116771). We propose to test a novel strategy to optimize
PrEP in pregnant and postpartum women in South Africa. Our randomized control trial (RCT) is designed
to address key barriers to maternal PrEP use and evaluate cost-effectiveness to inform national policy.
This trial builds on our earlier work demonstrating the acceptability, feasibility, safety and potential efficacy of a
package of interventions including PrEP, HIV self-testing (HIVST) for the participant and her partner(s), and
enhanced adherence counseling (with bio-feedback on adherence) combined with home PrEP delivery for
women who want to take PrEP but have difficulties adhering. We developed and piloted a novel intervention
entitled, Stepped Care to Optimize PrEP Effectiveness in Pregnant and Postpartum women (SCOPE-PP)
that addresses barriers to taking daily PrEP by reducing clinic visit frequency and empowering women to
adhere to PrEP. We will evaluate SCOPE-PP in a pragmatic RCT of pregnant and postpartum women at risk of
HIV acquisition. We will enroll 500 pregnant women in antenatal care and follow them through 12m
postpartum. Women in the intervention will be offered: HIVST for participants & partners, rapid PrEP collection
with enhanced adherence counseling. Women with poor PrEP adherence will be offered a differentiated care
model of home PrEP delivery to de-link PrEP from clinical visits. The primary outcome is PrEP continuation
and adherence in postpartum women, measured through drug levels of tenofovir diphosphate. We aim to: 1)
Evaluate the efficacy of the SCOPE-PP intervention on PrEP adherence in pregnant and postpartum women
in a RCT; 2) Assess the acceptability and feasibility of integrating SCOPE-PP into ante- and postnatal
care using a consolidated framework for implementation research; and 3) Estimate the incremental cost
effectiveness of SCOPE-PP vs. standard of care per HIV infection and disability-adjusted life-year averted.
This research is critical to inform maternal PrEP interventions to eliminate HIV acquisition and transmission in
South Africa and beyond."
10893451,"Project Summary/ Abstract
Background: Time restricted feeding (TRF) has greatly increased in popularity in recent years. TRF typically
involves confining the eating window to 6-8 h, and fasting for the remaining hours of the day. During the eating
window, individuals are not required to monitor energy intake. One of the reasons why TRF is so popular, is
because it does not require individuals to count calories in order to lose weight. This feature of TRF may
greatly improve long-term adherence to this diet, and in turn produce lasting weight control. Despite its growing
popularity, only four human trials have examined the effect of TRF on body weight. While these preliminary
studies show promise for TRF as a weight loss intervention, these previous trials are limited by short duration
(2-4 months), lack of a control group, and no comparison to traditional dieting (daily calorie restriction; CR).
We recently conducted a pilot study to compare the weight loss efficacy of 6-h TRF versus daily CR in adults
with obesity and prediabetes. Our findings show that TRF produced greater adherence, energy restriction, and
weight loss (-5%) versus CR (-3%) over 3 months. TRF also produced more pronounced reductions in insulin
resistance, blood pressure, and oxidative stress, versus CR. What remains unknown, however, is whether
these improvements by TRF would become more pronounced over longer periods of time (12-months), and if
TRF can be implemented to help individuals maintain weight loss and sustain reductions in metabolic disease
risk. The mechanisms (microbiome, appetite, gut peptides) that underlie the superior effects of TRF on body
weight and adherence, also remain unknown. Methods: A 12-month randomized, controlled, parallel-arm trial,
divided into: (1) 6-month weight loss period; and (2) 6-month maintenance period, will be implemented. Adults
with obesity and prediabetes (n = 120) will be randomized to 1 of 3 groups: (1) 6h-TRF (n = 40) ad libitum food
intake from 1-7 pm, fasting from 7-1pm daily, (2) CR (n = 40), 25% energy restriction daily; or 3) control (n =
40), ad libitum food intake daily. Hypotheses: The present proposal will test the following hypotheses: (Hyp1)
The TRF group will be more adherent with the intervention versus CR, which will result in greater energy
restriction, weight loss and weight loss maintenance; (Hyp2) The TRF group will experience greater
improvements in insulin sensitivity (measured by clamp), plasma lipids, blood pressure, inflammation, and
oxidative stress versus CR; (Hyp3) The TRF group will produce greater improvements in the composition,
structure, and metabolic activity of the gut microbiota, as well as in appetite and gut peptides, vs CR, which will
be related to superior adherence and weight loss. Significance: This study will be the first to show that TRF
can be implemented as an alternative to traditional dieting (i.e. daily calorie restriction) for long-term weight
management. This study will also show that TRF can be used as an effective non-pharmacological therapy to
improve insulin sensitivity and decrease metabolic disease risk in individuals with prediabetes and obesity. The
mechanisms (gut microbiome and appetite) that underlie the beneficial effects of TRF will also be elucidated."

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease affecting nearly 1% of adults causing a painful,
destructive inflammatory arthritis with serious long-term consequences including chronic pain, disability,
accumulation of morbidities, and excess mortality. Patients with RA are susceptible to developing interstitial
lung disease (ILD), a devastating complication with high morbidity and mortality. Rheumatoid factor (RF) and
anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (ant-CCP) autoantibodies are elevated in the serum of two-thirds of patients with
RA. Seropositive RA patients are more likely to develop RA-ILD. Previous studies suggest that mucosal
surfaces of the lung may be an initiating site for RA, after smoking or exposure to other inhalants, where RF,
anti-CCP, and other autoantibodies may be formed years before joint symptoms develop. Aberrant post-
translational modifications (PTM) to proteins may serve as neoantigens forming local inflammation in the lungs
and production of autoantibodies related to PTM. This site of lung injury may later manifest clinically as RA-ILD
and articular inflammation may impact risk for subclinical RA-ILD through systemic inflammation. Therefore,
RA-related autoantibodies, articular inflammation, and RA-ILD may be linked throughout the disease course of
RA.
These investigations will study whether RA-related autoantibodies and articular inflammation predict subclinical
and clinically-apparent RA-ILD. In the first aim, we will perform a nested case-control study using a derivation
dataset in the Brigham RA Sequential Study (BRASS) and a replication dataset in the Partners Biobank.
BRASS and the Partners Biobank are patient registries for research. We have identified RA-ILD cases as well
as controls with RA but no ILD in these research registries and propose to measure clinical and PTM RA-
related autoantibodies. In the second aim, we will perform a multi-site prospective observational study of
patients with new-onset RA who will undergo serial measures of articular inflammation and chest high-
resolution computed tomography imaging to evaluate whether the burden of articular inflammation in early RA
reflects risk for subclinical RA-ILD. In the third aim, we will analyze whether smokers in COPDGene with
elevation of RA-related autoantibodies without articular RA are more likely to have subclinical ILD. COPDGene
is a large US nationwide observational study that has already been phenotyped for presence or absence of ILA
on chest computed tomography imaging.
Dr. Jeffrey Sparks (the PI) is an Assistant Professor of Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and
Harvard Medical School. He is an early-stage investigator previously funded by NIAMS through K23 and R03
awards to investigate the role of the lung in RA etiology and outcomes. These proposed studies will interrogate
the overarching hypothesis that RA autoimmunity, articular inflammation, and ILD are intrinsically linked across
the disease course of RA (pre-RA, early RA, established RA). These studies have high potential for impactful
results that will elucidate the pathogenesis of both RA and RA-ILD and may ultimately provide the evidence
basis for RA-ILD screening and prevention strategies for this devastating complication."

This new Institutional Training Grant (T32) application from the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) will
provide multidisciplinary and interprofessional research training for physician-scientists in emerging infectious
diseases (EIDs). The ongoing risk and likelihood of facing outbreaks and epidemics caused by EIDs highlights
a critical need for developing physician-scientists with trans-disciplinary skills in clinical medicine,
epidemiology, field investigation, laboratory science, and biocontainment. The program capitalizes on world-
class faculty expertise, longstanding institutional commitments, and unique research resources. It includes
targeted recruitment of candidates at local, regional and national levels. Candidates will be physicians who are
completing or have completed, an ACGME-certified residency or fellowship. One trainee per year will enter and
complete 2-3 years of training during the 5-year program. Training includes instruction and mentorship in 1)
team science; 2) research design, epidemiological methods, and biostatistics (MSc in Clinical Science); 3)
EIDs and outbreak investigation; 4) clinical and research biocontainment/biosafety; 5) responsible conduct of
research; 6) field epidemiology; and 7) scientific writing. Each of the trainees will apply their training by
conducting translational research while receiving intensive scientific and career mentorship through a novel
Team Science framework called individualized Multidisciplinary, Interprofessional Mentorship Team (iMIMT).
Each iMIMT will include the trainee, a primary and secondary mentor (a PhD scientist and a MD scientist), and
2 or 3 peer or specialized knowledge mentors. iMIMTs will receive regular Team Science training and
coaching. Instruction in grant writing will culminate in submission of an NIH career development application in
the last year of training. Regular, but limited clinical responsibility will enable trainees to maintain clinical skills
and learn how to manage a dual clinical-research career. Our 29 program faculty have productive translational
research programs in EIDs and a record of successful mentoring. They are complemented by collaborating
investigators from Peru, Colombia, Mexico, Dominican Republic, and Brazil. Additional program support faculty
have specialized expertise for programmatic/operational support. The trainees' individualized development
plan includes well-defined training activities, expected competencies, indicators of success, and a timeline for
completion. Co-Program Directors and 3 Associate Program Directors will lead the program under Steering
Committee governance. Sub-committees will oversee trainees' recruitment and selection, mentorship, and
scientific progress. An External Advisory Committee will evaluate the program's progress annually. At
completion, our trainees will have strong trans-disciplinary understanding of EIDs, will be grounded in research
methods and outbreak investigation, will have tools for collaborative problem-solving, and critical skills in
manuscript and grant writing. All of these will facilitate their transition to an independent physician-scientist."

N6-methyl-adenosine (m6A) is the most abundant mRNA methylation in mammalian cells. Emerging evidence
has linked m6A with cancer phenotypes in many cancers, spurring a surge of research in studying m6A and
cancer biology. However, dysregulation of m6A effector writers, erasers, and readers and reprogramming of
m6A sites are poorly characterized. How different modes of m6A-regulation of gene expression mediate the
downstream cancer pathways and phenotypes is mostly missing. We have developed several widely used
informatics tools for m6A peak detection, differential m6A analysis, and functional predictions for m6A targets
from MeRIP-seq m6A profiling data. Using these tools, we worked together with cancer biology collaborators to
reveal reprogramed viral and host m6A epitranscriptome in cells infected by the oncogenic virus KSHV and
discovered a cross-talk between m6A writers, erasers, and readers to regulate cancer growth and progression.
However, the fast-moving m6A and cancer research poses many unmet informatics challenges. Among them,
the ability to accurately identify single-base m6A sites and predict key m6A regulatory mechanisms from
profiling data is seriously lacking. Also, a comprehensive database that catalogs and enables queries of where,
what, and how of m6A methylation and function in normal and cancer conditions is highly desirable. To address
challenges, we propose to develop m6A-Suite, an informatics toolbox, pipeline, and resources to facilitate the
mechanistic study of m6A in cancer. A key obstacle to developing tools in m6A-Suite is a lack of large, high-
quality training datasets. Toward this end, we have collected 1,113 human and 680 mouse MeRIP-seq
samples from cancer cell lines, tumors, and normal tissues and identified >4M m6A peaks. In parallel, we have
also collected 194,060 single-base m6A sites in 9 cell lines and 3 tissues. We propose to leverage this data to
construct the highly desirable training datasets. Using these datasets, we will develop efficient and accurate
tools for single-base m6A detection and quantification from MeRIP-seq and nanopore data (Aim 1), enable the
prediction of m6A-mediated RNA decay and splicing (Aim 2), and establish the comprehensive, queriable m6A-
KB knowledgbase to catalog these predictions in an extensive collection of public MeRIP-seq and nanopore
data in cancer and normal cells, and tissues in diverse conditions(Aim 3). We will systematically test and
evaluate these tools within this project and through many established and emerging collaborations inside and
outside the ITCR consortium. We will make the tools and data freely available to the research community and
constantly seek feedback from the collaborators and users for improvement. Given the emerging nature of
m6A and cancer research, the addition of these tools to the ITCR program will positively impact this important,
fast-growing, new area of cancer research."

 Yersinia pestis causes bubonic, septicemic and pneumonic plague with high rates of mortality in the
absence of immediate treatment. Although Y. pestis is susceptible to many antibiotics and outbreaks have
been contained in present day, plague continues to cause lethal human infections in areas where Y. pestis
has established persistent enzootic cycles in wild rodents. In 2015, 15 plague cases were reported in the
United States, several occurring in National Parks, with a case fatality rate of ~33%. This underscores the
challenges associated with combatting this devastating disease. Additionally, Y. pestis has been deployed as
a biological weapon and with its genetic tractability, natural acquisition of antibiotic resistance and relative
ease of acquisition from nature, Y. pestis has been classified as a weaponizable pathogen with the potential
for inflicting widespread human death. Yersinia spp. that are pathogenic for humans possess a type III
secretion system (T3SS) that is essential for virulence. This T3SS injects protein effectors into host cells to
manipulate functions for the benefit of the bacterium. The T3SS apparatus (T3SA) provides the energized
conduit for translocation of these effectors from the bacterium and into the host cell cytoplasm. The external
portions of the T3SA are the needle, the tip protein and the first of two translocator proteins. For Yersinia,
LcrV is the needle tip protein and YopB is the first translocator protein. These proteins are highly conserved
among Yersinia spp. and are required for pathogenesis. We have demonstrated that, when administered
intranasally (IN) in the presence of the appropriate adjuvant, these two proteins protect mice against a lethal
challenge by Y. pestis and Y. enterocolitica. We have fused LcrV and YopB to produce YerF and have fused
LTA1, the active moiety of dmLT (double mutant labile toxin) from enterotoxigenic E. coli, to the N-terminus
of these fusions to produce L-YerF. Within this proposal, we intend to assess the L-YerF as a self-
adjuvanting protective subunit vaccine. We hypothesize that L-YerF will provide humoral and cellular
immune responses that will protect mice against infections causing pneumonic and bubonic plague."
10851958,"Painful trigeminal neuropathy (PTN) is defined as facial pain in the distribution(s) of one or more
branches of the trigeminal nerve, associated with neural damage induced by trauma, viral infection, or other
causes. PTN is very unresponsive to medical and surgical treatments. Clearly, a more in-depth knowledge of
the molecular pathomechanisms of PTN are in urgent need to improve the management of this disorder.
 In the last six years our group has demonstrated the presence of increased levels of the 18kDa
translocator protein (TSPO, using positron emission tomography) and/or myo-inositol (mIns, using magnetic
resonance spectroscopy), in the brains of patients with various chronic pain conditions. Because both TSPO
and mIns are overexpressed by glial cells, our results suggest that neuroinflammation might be a pervasive
phenomenon that can be observed across multiple, etiologically heterogeneous human pain disorders, but in a
disorder-specific spatial distribution within the central nervous system. Despite these advances, the clinical
significance of these brain inflammatory signals (e.g., whether neuroinflammation imaging could be used to
identify patients more likely to respond to anti-inflammatory therapies) remains to be evaluated.
 In this exploratory project, we will recruit PTN patients scheduled to receive oral steroid therapy. All
participants will be evaluated clinically by an experienced neurologist and, prior to commencing their treatment,
receive brain imaging with integrated (i.e., simultaneous) positron emission tomography / magnetic resonance
imaging (PET/MRI) and [11C]PBR28, a second-generation radioligand for TSPO, which we have used to
demonstrate glial activation in patients with pain or neurodegenerative disorders. After the scan, participants
will undergo a 3-week treatment with the steroid prednisone, followed by another clinical/behavioral visit.
Clinical characterization will include quantitative sensory testing and questionnaires. Patients’ imaging data will
be compared to an existing dataset of healthy controls and chronic pain patients with a different etiology
(chronic low back pain) to assess the specificity of our findings to PTN.
 For Aim 1, we will assess in-vivo neuroinflammation in painful trigeminal neuropathy, using multimodal
brain imaging. For Aim 2 we will test the brain neuroinflammatory signals’ ability to predict response to steroid
treatment. This work will advance our understanding of the clinical significance of neuroinflammation in chronic
pain conditions.
 While this project is focused on neuropathic pain, identifying the role of glia in the development and
maintenance of persistent neuropathic pain and pain-related disability in humans will have important practical
implications for the management of a wide range of pain disorders. For instance, it will provide crucial human
evidence contributing to rationale for the development of tailored interventions focused on glial modulation."
10795062,"The goal of this R21 application is to convert existing mouse models of moderate and severe Osteogenesis
Imperfecta (OI) caused by type 1 collagen mutations to conditional mouse models of moderate and severe OI.
Conditional mouse models offer several advantages over the existing strains. First, conditional mouse strains
can be maintained and distributed by public repositories; existing strains are in individual labs, and not in
repositories, because of their skeletal fragility. Second, OI is a multi-system disease that affects bone, heart,
lung, tendon, ligament, and skin. When studying OI, the phenotype in one organ system (e.g., heart or lung) is
confounded by disease-associated problems in another organ system (e.g., spine and ribs). Conditional mouse
models in which Cre-recombinase is used to express the mutant protein in a tissue-specific manner minimizes
this confounding. Currently, there are no conditional mouse models with type 1 collagen mutations, even
though ~ 85% of human OI is caused by such mutations. Third, by converting existing strains to conditional
strains, any new data obtained with the conditional strains can be compared to previously published data
because the same mutation was studied. We will modify existing alleles by inserting a gene-trap using i-
GONAD gene-editing technology. Applying gene-traps and i-GONAD will enable us to efficiently convert 4
existing OI-causing alleles (Aga2, Jrt, Brtl, and p.G610C) in mice to conditional OI-causing alleles. Mouse
strains with the new conditional alleles can be distributed by public repositories. We will also determine the
effect of inducing endogenous expression of mutant type 1 collagen in hypertrophic chondrocytes, since
hypertrophic chondrocytes have been shown to transdifferentiate into osteoblasts and osteoprogenitors.
Therefore, it is important to know if bone properties are strongly influenced by cells expressing mutant type 1
collagen that have descended from hypertrophic chondrocytes, or if unaffected bone forming cells descended
from other progenitor sources compensate for, or outcompete, the mutant hypertrophic chondrocyte-derived
descendants. This latter knowledge will aid investigators who are interested in using cell therapies to
displace/replace mutant osteoblasts and osteoprogenitors with wild-type ones."
10798260,"Tools for reversible short-term degradation of TCF-1 to address its molecular functions
Abstract
During T cell development, the T cell-specific DNA binding protein TCF-1 performs multiple stage and
lineagespecific epigenetic functions. TCF-1 has been associated with both enhancing and reducing chromatin
accessibility and gene expression depending on the region it binds to and the proximal binding of other regulators.
There is a gap in our knowledge in how TCF-1 leverages its stage and context-specific functions. TCF-1 is
essential for initiating the commitment of progenitor cells to the T-cell lineage and it modulates the epigenetic
and transcription profiles of developing T-cells at almost every developmental transition and T-cell lineage.
Classically TCF-1 has been viewed as a downstream effector of the canonical WNT signaling pathway, bound
by β-catenin in response to WNT activation to act as a transcriptional activator. However, TCF-1 has two main
isoforms of which only the full-length protein (TCF-1p45) can interact with β-catenin, while the short isoform (TCF-
1p38) cannot. Therefore, TCF-1 can function within or independently of the WNT cascade. The direct binding of
TCF-1 to its conserved motif bends the DNA helix and has the potential to alter the 3D chromatin conformation
genome-wide with unknown consequences on the chromatin landscape, gene expression, and cellular
development. Current evidence suggests that the functional outcomes of TCF-1 depends on the group of
regulators with which it is co-recruited to DNA and on the presence or absence of the TCF-1 motif at the
recruitment sites. Based on this evidence we postulate that TCF-1 regulates T cell development by binding
to DNA in the context of discrete regulatory complexes to selectively shape the epigenetic landscape,
3D chromatin conformation, and gene expression of developing T cells. Optimally addressing this
hypothesis without confounding developmental defects resulting from long-term TCF-1 deficiency requires
inducible short-term manipulation of the protein levels of selective TCF-1 isoforms at specific stages of T cell
development. Therefore, to study the molecular and epigenetic functions of TCF-1 in time and space, it is
proposed to generate and validate three animal models that when combined allows the inducible, in vivo
shortterm degradation of TCF-1 isoforms. One model will conditionally express the optimized version of the Oryza
sativa TIR1 protein (OsTIR1(F74G), which enables precise temporal in vivo degradation of any mAID tagged
protein in a tissue and developmental stage specific manner. The other two models will generate mAID tagged
TCF-1p45 or all TCF-1 isoforms This research will not only offer crucial insight into longstanding questions of TCF1
functionality and the division of labor between its isoforms but will also provide novel validated mouse models as
a resource to the wider community."

Hypertension is a high-risk factor for stroke, cardiovascular diseases, and renal failure and it is one of the
leading causes of death in the US and afflicts 75 million people. Primary hypertension, the most common form
of hypertension, is associated with elevated sympathetic vasomotor tone and hyperactivity of the hypothalamic
pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis. However, the role of hyperactivity of the HPA axis in elevated sympathetic outflow
in primary hypertension remains largely unknown. The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus is a
critical brain region that integrates neuroendocrine and cardiovascular functions. In primary hypertension, PVN
presympathetic neuron activity is increased and provides excitatory drive to maintain heightened sympathetic
vasomotor tone. Glutamatergic synaptic inputs to the PVN presympathetic neurons are enhanced in
spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). However, the cellular mechanisms underlying hyperactivity of PVN
presympathetic neurons and enhanced excitatory synaptic inputs in SHRs remain unknown. The
corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH)-containing neurons in the PVN (PVN-CRH neurons) are an essential
component of the HPA axis. PVN-CRH neurons are activated in hypertension as indicated by increased
expression levels of CRH protein and mRNA levels in the PVN in patients with primary hypertension. The
objective of this project is to determine the role of PVN-CRH neurons in regulating blood pressure and
sympathetic outflow in primary hypertension. Our pilot study found that PVN-CRH neuron activity was
increased in SHRs, and selective inhibition or ablation of PVN-CRH neurons decreased arterial blood pressure
in SHRs. In addition, selective inhibition of PVN-CRH neurons suppressed the activity of PVN presympathetic
neurons in SHRs; the effect was eliminated by blocking CRH receptor 1. Thus, we will test our central
hypothesis that increased activity of PVN-CRH neurons leads to hyperactivity of PVN presympathetic neurons
and elevated sympathetic outflow in primary hypertension. We will first determine if hyperactivity of PVN-CRH
neurons is required for high blood pressure and elevated sympathetic outflow in primary hypertension (Aim 1).
We will also identify the synaptic mechanism underlying hyperactivity of PVN-CRH neurons in hypertension
(Aim 2). Finally, we will determine the role of PVN-CRH neurons in the elevated activity of PVN presympathetic
neurons and enhanced glutamatergic synaptic inputs in hypertension (Aim 3). Our proposed studies will greatly
improve the understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying primary hypertension. We
expect our studies to provide novel information about the neuronal mechanisms responsible for primary
hypertension and an important rationale for developing novel treatment strategies to reduce sympathetic
vasomotor tone in primary hypertension."
10879034,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
During protein synthesis, the ribosome integrates multiple cues to ensure that the correct protein is made at the
right place, the right time and at the right concentration. These cues are the result of signals triggered by varying
cellular needs and environmental conditions such as proliferation and stress. In eukaryotes, the integrated-stress
response (ISR) responds to stresses through the activation of kinases that act on the initiation factor eIF2.
Phosphorylation of eIF2 represses global translation, but also derepresses translation of key pro-survival
mRNAs. In yeast, ISR is activated by the eIF2 kinase Gcn2. Recent studies from several groups, including
ours, have pointed to a central role for ribosomes and in particular their stalling during the activation of ISR.
Interestingly, ribosome stalling also activates ribosome-quality control (RQC), which depends critically on an E3
ligase Hel2. During the previous funding period, we established that Hel2 is activated in response to ribosome
collisions and showed that chemical insults that damage RNA trigger RQC. Notably, these very same agents
also activate ISR, suggesting that RQC and ISR are tightly be coordinated. In a very recent study, we showed
that not only do ribosome collisions activate both processes, but that the activation of one suppresses that of the
other. Emerging from these studies is the observation that collided ribosomes are widely used as sensors to
trigger an appropriate response, depending on the type and level of stress. Indeed, in preliminary data presented
in this proposal, we provide compelling evidence for a role for ribosome collisions in signaling to other nucleic
acid damage pathways, particular those involved in DNA-damage repair. This proposal is focused on
understanding the molecular rationale by which collided ribosomes can activate these seemingly unrelated
processes. Our preliminary data indicate that the A status of the ribosome is important for ISR activation, and in
Aim 1 we will probe the conformation of ribosomes under various stress conditions and assess how they impact
Gcn2 recruitment. We will expand on these studies by reconstituting ISR and RQC activities to provide a
mechanistic understanding for the apparent preferential activation of RQC over ISR. Notably, robust ISR also
requires the presence of the highly conserved transcriptional coactivator Mbf1, which we and others showed to
bind collided ribosomes. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that stalling activates ISR using a two-pronged
mechanism, in which collided ribosomes in addition to activating Gcn2 modulate ISR coactivation by Mbf1. In
particular, we will dissect the role of Mbf1 interactions with the ribosome in regulating its function through post-
translational modification. Finally, we have a wealth of preliminary data linking RNA-quality control processes
with DNA repair. Aim 3 establishing molecular details about how signaling is transduced between the two
processes, which is hitherto unexplored. Altogether, we will leverage our expertise in ribosome biochemistry and
yeast genetics in combination with resources we accrued over the past funding period to reveal how collided
ribosomes provide a structural platform for several conserved signaling processes."

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are large RNA viruses with a well-demonstrated potential for jumping host species. The
persistent threat of novel emergent CoVs necessitates a thorough understanding of CoV immunity and
preparedness for outbreak response. Four CoVs circulate seasonally, and SARS-CoV-2 has further
demonstrated the ability of coronaviruses to re-infect the same individual multiple times over a lifetime.
Whether CoV reinfections occur due to evolving viral epitopes or waning immunologic memory, and the role of

OC43, with low pathogenicity and structural similarity to the severe CoVs, will advance our understanding of
CoV immunology and provide a foundation for pan-CoV vaccine and therapeutic development in preparation
for future outbreaks.
Under the mentorship of Dr. Frieman, an expert in coronaviruses, and Dr. Neuzil, an expert in vaccine
development and controlled human infection models, I will pursue this goal of developing a CHIM with the
seasonal CoV OC43. A 2022 isolate of OC43 is undergoing ongoing development for use in a CHIM. However,
the assays to evaluate immunity to seasonal CoVs such as OC43 have historically been limited by relatively
poor growth in cell culture and lack of specificity by binding assays. Therefore, in Aim 1 I will use
pseudoviruses to develop a functional neutralization assay to assess immunity to seasonal CoVs, evaluating
the ability of sera from the past four decades to neutralize both recent and older OC43 pseudotyped viruses.
This will provide a mechanism to rapidly evaluate seasonal CoV neutralization with greater accuracy than
antibody binding alone. In Aim 2 I will build on a recent influenza CHIM conducted at the University of Maryland
to explore the diversity of influenza mutations occurring within individuals after a controlled infection, providing
novel explorations of the host factors that affect viral diversity. The viral genome analysis platform that we
develop in aim 2 will be essential for evaluating the viral diversity that develops during an OC43 CHIM. In Aim
3 I will develop the protocol for a seasonal CoV CHIM, with careful consideration for safety and endpoints that
will allow us to evaluate the effect of pre-existing immunity on symptomatic infection, viral shedding, and
duration of immune response.
A seasonal CoV CHIM has not been conducted for over 40 years, and today would allow us to characterize the
cellular and humoral correlates of protection, define host mediators of susceptibility, and directly assess
durability of immunity. This model system will be an essential tool for assessing variant-proof pan-coronavirus
interventions and will provide preparedness for the emergence of future novel coronaviruses."
10815870,"With age comes increasing emphasis on making highly consequential, long term and varied decisions, ranging from medical to financial to legal, and beyond. These decisions underlie the basic competencies for independent living. Cognitive impairment often hinders basic decision-making capacities, significantly impacting quality of life. Deficits in decision-making capacity sadly often lead to harmful consequences including financial loss, incapacity to consent to medical procedures, and even vulnerability for elder abuse. There is growing evidence that early screening of decision-making capacity can be an important indicator of early age-related cognitive impairment related to Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD). Yet, despite a 2020 United States Preventive Services Task Force report pointing to the importance of early assessment and detection of such functional outcomes for older adults, caregivers, and families, cognitive impairment screening typically does not include systematic and comprehensive assessment of decision-making capacity.
We will establish the Advancing Reliable Measurement in Cognitive Aging and Decision-making Ability (ARMCADA) research network and integrate efforts to adapt, develop, validate and norm measures to assess decision-making functionality in an aging population. Our Northwestern University team has extensive experience in developing national research networks for the purpose of assessment system development, validation and distribution, including the original NIH Neuroscience Blueprint contract to create the NIH Toolbox for Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function® (NIHTB). We will leverage this expertise to complete three specific aims:
The proposed project will 1) Create the ARMCADA research network with the goal of advancing a theoretical taxonomy of decision-making skills for successful aging; 2) Identify, synthesize, create, and validate new measures of decision-making in an aging sample representative of the entire range of decision-making capacity levels and older adults from minority backgrounds; 3) Facilitate scalable nationwide public dissemination of these measures, including integration into Electronic Health Record systems, to benefit the early identification of older adults with cognitive impairment and evaluate the efficacy of potential interventions aimed to mitigate cognitive decline commonly associated with AD/ADRD."

BACKGROUND: Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) are common and major drivers of morbidity
and mortality after major inpatient surgery. Various risk prediction scores identify patients at high risk of
developing PPCs and observational research has connected peri-operative care practices with subsequent
risk. However, anesthesia providers do not have patient specific evidence based interventions to prevent
pulmonary complications.
RESEARCH: The proposed research will draw on a wealth of perioperative information available to identify the
interactions of patient, procedure and process of care factors which place patients at risk of PPCs. This will
incorporate advances in data science to the pre-operative prediction of PPCs (Aim 1). We will then revise and
improve this estimate in light of the high fidelity intraoperative data stream from ventilators, monitors and
patient response to real life decisions being made during the delivery of anesthesia care (Aim 2). This will allow
understanding of what features most contributed to patient specific risk (Aim 3). The proposed research and
training will provide Dr Colquhoun with the skills in data science to his transition to an independent researcher.
CANDIDATE: Dr Douglas A Colquhoun is a tenure track Assistant Professor of Anesthesiology at the
University of Michigan. He is board certified in Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine and maintains an
active clinical practice in the perioperative care of patients undergoing major surgery. During a T32 Research
Training Grant, Dr Colquhoun developed expertise in the derivation of outcomes and processes of care from
electronic medical record data. His long term career goal is to prevent postoperative pulmonary complications
by offering anesthesia providers data driven strategies for management delivered at the point of care.
ENVIRONMENT: The University of Michigan is the coordinating center for the Multicenter Perioperative
Outcomes Group (MPOG) an international consortium of 50 anesthesiology and surgical departments with
perioperative information systems. Sachin Kheterpal, MD, MBA is the primary mentor for Dr. Colquhoun, and is
the Director for MPOG. Dr Kheterpal and the Department of Anesthesiology have a rich history of developing
and deploying innovative software solutions to address problems in perioperative medicine and research. Dr
Colquhoun will additionally be advised from expert co-mentors drawn from across the institution and a scientific
advisory panel expert in the prevention and management of postoperative complications."
10896007,"Our long-term goal is to understand the molecular basis of a novel morphologically-conserved non-apoptotic
developmental cell-death program we uncovered, and to determine its roles in mammalian development and
disease. Programmed cell death is a major cell fate. Apoptosis, an extensively studied cell death process,
requires caspase proteases and is accompanied by chromatin compaction and cytoplasmic shrinkage.
Surprisingly, mice lacking apoptotic effectors survive to adulthood. These observations suggest that non-
apoptotic cell death may play key roles in animal development. Although genes promoting necrotic cell death
have been described, these are not required for development. Thus, whether alternative developmental cell
death pathways exist, and if so, what molecular mechanisms govern their execution, is a major outstanding
question. Our studies of the C. elegans linker cell provide direct evidence that caspase-independent non-
apoptotic cell death pathways operate during animal development. Linker cell death occurs in the absence of
C. elegans caspases, and other apoptosis genes are also not required, nor are genes implicated in autophagy
or necrosis. The morphology of a dying linker cell is characterized by lack of chromatin condensation, a
crenellated nucleus, and swelling of cytoplasmic organelles. Remarkably, cell death with similar features (linker
cell-type death, LCD) also occurs in vertebrates, and is characteristic of neuronal degeneration in
polyglutamine diseases. We recently described a pathway governing C. elegans LCD. This is the first such
framework for a non-apoptotic developmental cell-death program. LCD is controlled by Wnt signals that
function in parallel with a developmental-timing and a MAPKK pathway to control non-canonical activity of
HSF-1, a conserved heat-shock transcription factor. let-70/Ube2D2, encoding a conserved E2 ubiquitin-
conjugating enzyme, is a key target of HSF-1. The E3 components CUL-3/cullin, RBX-1, BTBD-2, and EBAX-1
function with LET-70/UBE2D2 for LCD. Our recent evidence suggests that histone methylation may be a target
of this pathway, likely resulting in genome-wide chromatin opening, allowing nuclease access and DNA
degradation. LCD pathway components promote vertebrate cell-degenerative processes. pqn-41, a glutamine-
rich protein, is reminiscent of polyQ proteins causing neurodegeneration. and tir-1/Sarm and BTBD-2 promote
distal axon degeneration following axotomy, supporting conserved cell dismantling roles. We recently showed
that treatment of mammalian cells with the kinase inhibitor staurosporin (STS) causes LCD like death. Here we
will build on these studies to uncover LCD pathway targets, and study relevance to mammals. We will: (1)
Investigate the role of SAMS-4, a BTBD-2 target, and NUC-1, a DNaseII enzyme, in LCD, and test an
hypothesized pathway for these in chromatin modification and DNA degradation. (2) Identify EBAX-1 target
genes and assess roles in LCD control. (3) Characterize STS-induced death in mammalian cells, define
conservation with C. elegans LCD, and identify relevant genes."
10892080,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Typical elite control of HIV infection is no longer considered an optimal model for antiretroviral therapy (ART)-
free remission due to increased transcriptional activity, chronic inflammation, and immune dysfunction in these
individuals. “Exceptional control” is a related but distinct phenotype of natural HIV control that is now of great
interest to the HIV cure community. The overarching objective of this proposal is to identify and characterize
individuals exhibiting exceptional control in blood and tissues, and to initiate studies that seek to understand the
mechanism by which this is achieved. We have several inter-related hypotheses: (1) exceptional controllers
exhibit greater control over HIV replication in lymphoid tissues than typical elite controllers, despite comparable
levels of control in peripheral blood, (2) exceptional controllers will have less systemic inflammation than typical
elite controllers and ART-treated individuals and these levels will be similar to those in uninfected individuals, (3)
in contrast to typical elite controllers, exceptional controllers who have initiated ART and then interrupt therapy
in a highly monitored setting will exhibit no change in markers of residual viremia, inflammation, or immune
activation. To investigate these hypotheses, we will begin by identifying natural HIV controllers in the UCSF
SCOPE cohort who in the absence of ART have very low levels of intact proviral HIV DNA in a large number of
peripheral blood CD4+ T cells; these will be the putative exceptional controllers. Individuals who have higher
levels of intact proviral DNA will be considered typical elite controllers. In Aim 1, we will perform a cross-sectional
study using gut biopsies and lymph node tissue aspirates to measure the size and distribution of the HIV reservoir
at steady-state, comparing exceptional controllers with typical elite controllers. In Aim 2, we will perform a cross-
sectional study of the immunologic consequences of exceptional control by measuring immune activation with
PET-MR imaging and soluble and cell-associated markers of inflammation and immune system activation. We
will compare exceptional controllers at steady-state with typical elite controllers, non-controllers on ART, and
uninfected individuals. In Aim 3, we will analyze samples collected in an externally funded prospective study of
HIV controllers and non-controllers interrupting ART to determine the virologic and immunologic changes that
occur at the earliest timepoints when the host first encounters rebounding virus (the “intercept”). We anticipate
that exceptional controllers interrupting therapy will demonstrate no substantial increase in these markers in
contrast with the other groups. If our hypotheses are correct, we expect that exceptional controllers will
demonstrate significant differences compared with typical elite controllers and non-controllers, will be
indistinguishable from people without HIV infection, and will not have benefitted from ART. If this is the case, it
will lead to further mechanistic studies to understand the process by which this level of control is achieved and
might inform further work to develop a model for HIV “remission.”"

Aim of this research is to understand why endocrine b-cells in the pancreas of diabetic patients fail, with
an eye toward identifying new genetic, biochemical, and cellular pathways that can be exploited as
therapeutic targets to prevent and reverse this disease process. This grant has supported several
original and widely reproduced discoveries, identifying a homeostatic loop orchestrated by Foxo
transcription factors that integrates disparate hormonal and nutrient signals into a gene expression
program intended to preserve b-cell function and identity. Signal achievements of this work have been
the demonstration of three stages leading to b-cell failure: metabolic inflexibility, b-cell conversion into
other pancreatic cell types, and dedifferentiation into an endocrine progenitor-like state. Since the last
competing renewal, this grant has supported several major new findings: (i) identification of human
diabetes-enriched islet cell types and master regulatory activities driving cell-state transitions; (ii)
discovery of BACH2 as a driver of b/a-cell transition and b-cell dedifferentiation in humans; (iii)
discovery of AFF3 as a driver of human b/a-cell transition; (iv) pathogenic role of aldehyde
dehydrogenase 1 isoform A3 (ALHD1A3) in metabolic inflexibility leading to b-cell failure; (v) description
of a “recovering b-cell” signature associated with reversal of metabolic inflexibility; (vi) identification of
C2CD4A as a human diabetes susceptibility gene with a role in suppressing b-cell “disallowed” genes,
thereby controlling metabolic flexibility; (vii) functional demonstration that regulation of mitochondrial
complex III function through the oxidoreductase Cyb5r3 is critical in the progression of metabolic
inflexibility into b-cell failure; (viii) identification of vitamin D-binding protein (Gc) as a marker of a-to-b-
cell transition and potential functional mediator of b-cell dysfunction; (ix) demonstration of antagonistic
epistasis between FoxO1 and Hnf4a in b-cells. The PI proposes to extend this work with the following
specific aims: In Aim 1, to test pharmacologically and mechanistically whether BACH2 inhibition can
reverse b-cell dedifferentiation and a/b-cell-state transitions. In Aim 2, to test the ability of newly
synthesized ALDH1A3 inhibitors to reverse metabolic inflexibility, restoring to b-cell function. In Aim 3
to characterize C2CD4A, a putative corepressor encoded by a human diabetes susceptibility locus, as
a potential link between type 2 diabetes genetics and metabolic inflexibility in b-cell dysfunction. This
body of work offers immediate, tangible therapeutic applications with the potential to prevent or reverse
b-cell failure, thus ensuring that we move from disease management to disease modification. It is
envisioned that the successful completion of these aims will lead to new diabetes therapeutics."

Intracellular recording from sensory cortex provides a window into the synaptic inputs that shape spiking
responses of individual cortical neurons, but until recently, this powerful technique has been limited to
anesthetized animals. By combining the unique expertise from our laboratories, we have developed a novel
technique that allow us to conduct, on a routine basis, reliable, whole-cell intracellular recording in primary
visual cortex (V1) of awake, behaving macaque monkeys. We combine intracellular recording with an array of
concomitant measurements that provide access to the state of the local network in which the neuron is
embedded as well as to the internal state of the animal. Using these techniques, we have access to both
subthreshold (membrane potentials, representing input) and suprathreshold (spikes, representing output)
responses of individual cortical neurons, while also utilizing the precise control of visual stimulation and the
subject’s behavioral state afforded by behaving primates.
Our ability to perform intracellular recording in awake, behaving primates opens the door to addressing three
fundamental questions with respect to the circuit-level mechanisms that mediate visual perception: (1) what
are the nature, sources, and behavioral consequences of the large neural variability of sensory cortical
neurons, (2) what is the contribution of internal state fluctuations to this variability, (3) what circuit models
can account for the observed neural variability during spontaneous and evoked responses?
To address these questions, in Aim 1 we will study the quantitative relationship between sub- and
suprathreshold activity during spontaneous and stimulus-evoked responses in V1 of fixating monkeys. This
will allow us to test the generality of previous findings from anesthetized animals. In Aim 2, we will examine
the relationship between the activity of single V1 neurons and perceptual decisions in monkeys that are
engaged in a demanding visual detection task. Specifically, we will examine how sub- and suprathreshold
responses are altered by changing the attentional and motivational states under which the stimulus is
presented. Finally, in Aim 3 we will test a novel set of circuit models that can account for our observed results
and guide future experiments."

 This is a revised grant application entitled “Alterations in Post-Receptor Insulin Signaling in Diabetes and
Insulin Resistance.” Insulin and IGF-1 acting via their cognate receptors (IR and IGF1R) to produce a wide
range of metabolic and growth effects on most cells in the body. Over many years, work from my lab has been
devoted to understanding the intermediate signals in this process and how these may be altered in disease.
Thus, we have characterized extensively the roles of insulin receptor substrate proteins in coupling IR and
IGF1R to downstream effector systems, the important role of PI-3 kinase and Akt in the metabolic actions of
insulin, and effects of MAP/mTOR/S6K kinase pathway in growth promotion. These studies have led to
development of an integrated model of the insulin signaling network in which there are critical nodes of signal
divergence that provide complementary information to different downstream actions of insulin. These critical
nodes also provide important sites of positive and negative regulation that can lead to alterations of insulin
action in disease. Recently, we have begun to dissect the full phosphoproteome downstream IR/IGF1R and,
through this, have identified two new Forkhead transcriptional mediators of insulin/IGF-1 signaling, FoxK1 and
FoxK2. From a disease perspective, we have also shown how different insulin resistant states alter the insulin
signaling network in different tissues. We have also developed iPS cell models to focus on identification of cell
autonomous components of insulin resistance in human disease. Indeed, as shown in our preliminary data,
myoblasts derived from T2D iPSCs demonstrate defects in downstream signaling and metabolic function in
vitro mirroring the defects found in vivo. More importantly, these cells also show dysregulation of a
multidimensional phosphorylation network - both inside and outside the classical insulin signaling cascade. In
this grant, we will focus on two interrelated specific aims: 1) Elucidate the fundamental differences in insulin
signaling in T2D and other insulin resistant states in vitro using targeted and global phosphoproteomics of
human iPS cell-derived myoblasts from normal individuals, T2D patients and non-diabetic individuals with
insulin resistance. We will assess how these changes affect cellular function and participate in insulin
resistance. 2) Define the role of two new downstream transcriptional regulators in insulin action, FoxK1 and
FoxK2. We will identify the genes regulated by FoxK1/2, determine how they complement other transcriptional
regulators in insulin regulation of cellular function, and how they are altered in diabetes. We will also define
FoxK regulated genes using Chip-Seq. Finally, we will create mice with tissue specific deletion of FoxK1,
FoxK2 and selected combinatorial knockouts to define their complementary roles in insulin-regulated gene
expression and insulin action in vivo. Together these studies will lead to a new level of understanding insulin
signaling and its alterations in diabetes, provide deeper understanding of insulin regulation of gene expression
and provide new points for therapy of type 2 diabetes and other insulin resistant disorders."
10932118,"PROJECT 3 Abstract
In the US, at least six states and hundreds of localities have restricted or banned sales of flavored electronic
nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) in order to reduce youth vaping. Yet the evidence on these policies’ effects
on individual behavior is mixed, and some studies link them to increases in combustible cigarette use
(“smoking”). Nationally generalizable estimates for such regulations’ effects on contemporaneous cigarette,
cigar, and ENDS use—the three most popular tobacco/nicotine products in the US—are needed to clarify the
policies’ immediate impacts and model longer run effects on these behaviors as well as related health
outcomes and disparities. Thus, focusing on the Behavior and Impact Analysis scientific domains described in
RFA-OD-22-004, we will apply quasi-experimental research designs—methods designed to produce causal
estimates in the absence of randomized assignment—to nationally representative, restricted-use survey data
on adults and adolescents as well as retail sales data, in order to clarify such flavor restrictions’ effects.
Matching these datasets to data on state and local ENDS flavor restrictions, Aim 1 will estimate ENDS flavor
restrictions’ effects on youth and adult smoking and vaping, with sensitivity checks testing whether effect
estimates vary with policy attributes (e.g., retailer exemptions). To consider differential effects by urbanicity and
socioeconomic status (SES), Aim 2 will then test whether responses to flavor restrictions vary across urban vs.
rural jurisdictions; assess the extent to which this might be explained by geographic factors (e.g., proximity to
jurisdictions that allow flavored ENDS sales) vs. differences in resident characteristics (e.g., SES); and,
estimate implications for both urban-rural and SES disparities in smoking and vaping. As a federal flavor
restriction’s impacts may differ across areas with distinct state and local tobacco control policies, Aim 3 will
assess how flavor restrictions’ effects differ between localities with more vs. less restrictive tobacco control
policy environments. Those results will be used to estimate implications for the effectiveness of a federal flavor
ban, given observed variation in local policies. Finally, to further aid the Food and Drug Administration in
evaluating new policies’ effects, Aim 4 will use retail sales data to provide rapid analyses of new federal flavor
regulations’ relationships to tobacco/nicotine product sales (e.g., banning sales of menthol cigarettes or non-
tobacco flavored cigars) and consider associations with sales of newer non-nicotine flavoring products,
intended for use with cigarette, cigar, and/or ENDS, in order to understand if/how their availability modifies
flavor laws’ effects. Thus, this research will clarify flavor restrictions’ effects on youth and adult rates of
cigarette, cigar, and ENDS use, providing key parameters to inform our Center’s modeling of flavor restrictions’
long-term public health impacts, in order to aid CTP in assessing the impact of FDA flavor policies."
10932124,"PROJECT 4 Abstract
Tobacco use varies greatly by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES) in the US, with unacceptably
high cigarette smoking rates in American Indian Alaska Native and low education populations, as well as
vulnerable subpopulations at the intersection of race/ethnicity and SES (e.g. non-Hispanic Black (NHB) and
non-Hispanic White (NHW) individuals with a high school degree or less). Use of cigars and electronic nicotine
delivery systems (ENDS) are highest among NHB and NHW individuals respectively. Tobacco use trajectories
are further complicated by characterizing flavors in cigarettes (menthol), cigars, and ENDS, the use of which is
concentrated in specific subpopulations.
Policymakers are considering flavor restriction policies and other tobacco regulations but lack detailed scientific
information about how such policies could affect the US population and vulnerable subgroups. To address this
need, we will develop validated tobacco simulation models to project the impact of flavor restrictions on
tobacco use and downstream health outcomes among vulnerable racial/ethnic and socioeconomic subgroups.
While existing simulation models consider cigarette smoking, with some now also assessing ENDS use, cigar
smoking has yet to be included in such models, despite its important implications for tobacco-related health
disparities. This project aims to characterize cigarette, cigar, and ENDS patterns of use by race/ethnicity,
education, and for vulnerable subgroups at their intersection (Aim 1). We will develop simulation models of
cigarette, cigar, and ENDS use for (a) key race/ethnicity groups (NHB, NHW, Hispanics and AIAN), (b) four
different education groups (less than high school, high school degree or GED, some college, and college
degree or more) and (c) for groups at the intersection of race/ethnicity and education (NHB, NHW, Hispanic
individuals of low vs. high educational attainment) (Aim 2). We will estimate the effects of flavor restrictions on
cigarette, cigar, and ENDS use by race/ethnicity and education using information from quasi-experimental
studies, systematic reviews, and expert consultations (Aim 3). Finally, we plan to project the impact of flavor
restrictions on US patterns of tobacco product use and downstream mortality outcomes by race/ethnicity and
education, and for key vulnerable groups at their intersection (Aim 4). This will provide a strong foundation for
studying the impact of other potential regulations on tobacco-related health outcomes in vulnerable subgroups.
As part of the Center for the Assessment of the Tobacco Regulations (CAsToR), this project will provide the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with much needed external modeling research that evaluates: 1) the
impact of flavor restrictions on tobacco use behaviors (Scientific domain: Behavior); 2) the long-term impact of
tobacco products and flavor restrictions on health (Scientific domain: Health Effects); and 3) the potential
differential impacts of flavor restrictions on key vulnerable populations and tobacco-related health disparities

10807024,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 More than 300,000 infants are born prematurely in the U.S. each year, and of these,
approximately 50,000 develop chronic respiratory disease due to their prematurity. The most
common respiratory manifestation is bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), which affects alveolar,
airway, and pulmonary vascular development. Limited data suggests that a substantial
percentage of children with BPD will have long-term respiratory symptoms persisting into adult
life with altered lung function trajectories. However, predicting the course of respiratory disease
in children with BPD throughout the lifespan is currently difficult, compounded by the wide
variation in outpatient management after initial hospital discharge. One of the most common
types of medical management are diuretics. Theoretically, diuretics reduce interstitial fluid within
the lungs, thus decreasing work of breathing. However, there is conflicting evidence regarding
the benefits/risks of diuretic use within the neonatal intensive care unit, and virtually no data or
guidelines for the use of these medications outside of the hospital. In light of the ongoing
controversy that broad use of long-term diuretics in preterm infants may or may not be beneficial
in the inpatient setting, our goal is to use “real-world” data to assess whether the outpatient use
of diuretics reduce acute and chronic respiratory morbidities in preterm infants and young
children less than 2 years of age and whether they are associated with the side effect of
impaired growth. In Aim 1, we hypothesize that the use of diuretics during the first 2 years of life
will result in less acute care use (e.g., emergency department visits and hospital readmissions)
and decreased chronic respiratory symptoms (e.g., activity limitations and difficulty breathing).
In Aim 2, we hypothesize that the use of diuretics during the first year after initial NICU
discharge will result in impairment of growth. These studies will help direct our understanding
and guidance for the use of outpatient diuretic use in children with BPD."
10774321,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Sleep is an active process requiring the participation of delimited nodes of sleep-promoting cell
populations. Work over the last twenty years has demonstrated that galanin expressing neurons in the
ventrolateral preoptic (VLPOGal) nucleus are necessary for normal sleep. While a portion of VLPO galanin
neurons is concentrated in a cluster, the so-called VLPO core (cVLPO), others are scattered dorsally and
medially to that core, a region that came to be known as the extended VLPO (eVLPO). Lesion and optogenetic
studies have demonstrated that the galanin expressing neurons in the cVLPO and those in the eVLPO are two
functionally distinct cell groups with the cVLPOGal neurons required for non-REM sleep (NREM) while the
eVLPOGal neurons required for REM sleep. Anatomical tracing studies have shown that the eVLPOGal neurons
innervate brainstem nuclei implicated in REM sleep regulation and through these descending projections, the
eVLPOGal neurons are thought to promote REM sleep by the disinhibition of the REM-generating neurons in
the pontine reticular formation. There remain however several fundamental gaps in our understanding of the
cellular and synaptic basis by which eVLPOGal neurons drive REM sleep. Studying the eVLPOGal population
has been proven to be quite challenging as the cVLPO and the eVLPO are small regions located in close
proximity and until now, there were no markers for selective targeting. We have recently discovered a potential
marker for the eVLPOGal neurons that will allow us to manipulate the eVLPOGal neurons independently from
their neighboring cVLPOGal neurons. Specifically, we have found that: 1) the eVLPOGal neurons selectively
express the neuropeptide neurotensin and, 2) that chemogenetic inhibition of the neurotensin eVLPO neurons
reduces REM sleep. We have also found that eVLPO neurotensin neurons send robust projections to regions
of the midbrain and pons that are known to suppress REM sleep including the ventrolateral periaqueductal
gray (vlPAG) and the locus coeruleus (LC). On the basis of these results, we propose that the eVLPO
neurotensin neurons promote REM sleep by disinhibiting REM-generating neurons in the pontine reticular
formation via inhibition of GABA neurons of the vlPAG and monoaminergic neurons of the LC. The current
proposal thus seeks to identify, first in vitro and then in vivo, the brainstem efferent outputs through which the
eVLPO neurotensin neurons drive REM sleep. To do so, we will first employ, in Specific Aims 1, in vitro circuit
mapping to identify the postsynaptic neurons that are targeted by the eVLPO neurotensin neurons. In Specific
Aim 2, we will use in vivo optogenetics to test whether the circuits first identified in the in vitro studies are
sufficient to produce REM sleep. Given the large knowledge gap this proposal seeks to fill, we expect results
from this work to provide 1) an important interpretative framework for future studies on the eVLPO neurotensin
pathways that are necessary and sufficient for promoting REM sleep and 2) more generally, a novel insight into
the role of the preoptic region in REM sleep regulation."

  Years 2023 and 2025 will be specific workgroup events inviting only those experts who are needed
 to further the progress of the workgroup objectives.
During these meetings a group of 130+ Food Safety Leaders will come together to discuss changes needed
to reduce foodborne illness. Targeted action plans will be refined in the Healthy People 2030 categories:
E. coli STEC, Listeria, Salmonella, Campylobacter and norovirus and various commodities.
Following this meeting AFDO will continue to lead the establishment of an AFDO Healthy People 2030
Steering Committee comprised of food safety leaders in government, associations and consumer groups
to help guide the next steps. The workgroups have been formed in the following three areas:
  Salmonella in Poultry.
  Norovirus Reduction through Retail Activities.
  Produce and E. coli O157:H7.
Each workgroup reports their activities to the steering committee. If the activities laid out by the working
groups are achieved a notable reduction in infections from the above pathogens will be the outcome. The
advancement of scientific knowledge will be achieved through the completion of the charges of each
workgroup."
10892891,"Secondhand harms from alcohol—also called alcohol’s harms to others—negatively affect users’ children,
partners, extended families, friends, neighbors, and communities. In contrast to alcohol-related harms, a
comprehensive empirical inventory of types, rates and impacts of secondhand harm from drugs in the US has
been entirely lacking. As states and communities grapple with challenges posed by legalization of recreational
marijuana, the worsening opioid crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, understanding how use of different drugs
(alone and in combination with alcohol) impacts families and communities takes on new importance to inform
policies and programs to minimize harm. This study, Secondhand Harms from Alcohol & Drugs: Impacts on
Families and Communities across the US, will build upon a prior NIAAA-funded study of alcohol’s harm to
others (R01AA022791) to fill this gap. We propose to develop, field and analyze the 2023 US Alcohol and Drug
Harm to Others Survey, a representative adult population survey focused on a key set of harms experienced by
victims of others’ use of prevalent substances including alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, opioid painkillers, heroin,
cocaine and methamphetamine. Using geocoded self-report data, we will assess prevalence of secondhand
impacts of each substance and of multiple substance use; rates and severity of harms from different types of
“others” (spouses/partners, family members, co-workers, friends and strangers); mental and physical health
impacts; and risk factors including victims’ personal characteristics and own substance use, as well as their
neighborhood, community and state contexts. The Aims are to: (1) document prevalence, overlap and trends in
secondhand harms from alcohol and drugs, (2) examine contexts contributing to secondhand harms, and (3)
assess impacts of secondhand harms from alcohol and drugs on mental and physical health and quality of life.
Based on our experience designing and analyzing national surveys, we propose to conduct a comprehensive
survey to collect detailed data on secondhand alcohol and drug harms, and analyze these using advanced
strategies, including some co-analysis with existing data on secondhand harms collected before and during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Major project innovations will be to generate comprehensive US population estimates of
specific secondhand drug harms, collect new longitudinal data, and study trends in alcohol and marijuana harms.
A conceptual innovation is to investigate the role of both macro (neighborhoods, state contexts) and micro
(drinking contexts, social relationships) environments vis a vis secondhand harms from alcohol and specific
drugs. Despite importance for prevention, few studies have identified environmental contexts in which
secondhand harms from alcohol and various drugs occur. We will examine how environments may contribute to
(or minimize) specific harms for women and other high-priority groups (racial/ethnic minorities and sexual/gender
minorities). Documenting types, overlap and severity of secondhand harms from alcohol and drugs has great
practical utility for prevention and promises to inform future development of effective public health policies."
10806189,"Eye as a Window into Brain Health in Hydrocephalus
Project Summary
Hydrocephalus is a debilitating condition caused by excess buildup of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the cerebral
ventricles. The overall global prevalence of hydrocephalus in children is 88 out of 100,000, with the mortality rate
of untreated hydrocephalus reaching up to 87%. Most pediatric hydrocephalus cases (>90%) are managed
operatively, using a ventricular shunt to divert CSF. Unfortunately, timing of shunting is guided by gross
measures of intracranial pressure (ICP) and brain health including ventricular size and clinical signs. Delaying
CSF diversion can lead to elevated ICP and irreversible brain injury. Invasive ICP monitoring, while more precise,
is not routinely adopted in children due to the risks of hemorrhage and brain injury. This proposal bridges a
significant clinical gap in care by validating ocular blood flow as a precise biomarker of ICP and brain ischemia
that can negate the need for invasive ICP monitoring. As a direct extension of the brain, the eye has served as
a window into studying ICP, but to date none of the noninvasive approaches evaluating ocular hemodynamics
has proven as reliable as invasive ICP monitoring. In our proposed study, ocular contrast-enhanced ultrasound
(CEUS) using a high-speed ultrasound system is performed in a high-fidelity pediatric porcine model of
hydrocephalus to validate ocular blood flow markers of ICP and brain ischemia. CEUS uses intravenously
injected microbubbles of 2-3 µm in size, smaller than red blood cells, that can be tracked across multiple
ultrasound frames using an advanced particle tracking method (called particle image and/or tracking velocimetry
or PIV/PTV). As a result, spatial and temporal changes in ocular microcirculation can be quantified for
assessment of elevated ICP and brain ischemia. While the CEUS technology is FDA-approved for pediatric
applications, specifically for evaluation of focal liver lesions and vesicoureteral reflux, ocular CEUS is off-label.
The investigative team stands ready for clinical translation following this proposal, as the PI currently leads the
first FDA-regulated, Investigational New Drug (IND)-approved clinical trials applying CEUS in infants with brain
injury and necrotizing enterocolitis. The central hypothesis of the proposal is that ocular CEUS will provide
accurate biomarkers of ICP and brain ischemia. The overall goal of the proposal is therefore to 1) validate and
refine the accuracy and reproducibility of the PIV/PTV for eye imaging using phantom models mimicking the
complex ocular microvascular networks and spontaneous eye movement, 2) validate ocular CEUS indices of
ICP and brain ischemia using an established pediatric porcine model of hydrocephalus and 3) assess in vivo
safety of the optimized ocular CEUS protocol. Our work will set the stage for clinical translation of a new
noninvasive tool for assessment of ICP and brain ischemia in pediatric hydrocephalus, which could ultimately
impact survival and long-term outcomes of affected children."
10895594,"Abstract/Project Summary
Disorders of androgens imbalance are highly prevalent in both sexes. Hyperandrogenic females experience
reproductive dysfunction, whereas low androgens disrupt sexual behavior, decrease libido and fertility, and
induce fatigue, depression, and bone loss in both sexes. Studies using mouse genetics (e.g., androgen
receptor knockout) replicate male reproductive dysfunctions caused by low androgens or AR insensitivity. In
females, AR insensitivity results in subfertility, with disrupted uterine morphology, fewer corpora lutea,
abnormal estrous cycles and accelerated reproductive senescence. AR is highly expressed in multiple brain
sites, but the role of specific neuronal circuitry or individual subpopulations has not been demonstrated, and
the causes and mechanisms underlying disorders of androgen imbalance mediated by brain AR remain
unknown. This is particularly important in androgens abuse and for gender dysphoric/gender incongruent
individuals which seek gender-affirming hormone treatment. The consequences and potential effects of
supraphysiologic androgens on brain function are largely unknown. Our main goal in this application is to
determine the role of direct androgen actions in highly interconnected brain sites that express low or virtually
no aromatase, i.e., neuronal circuitry not susceptible to estrogen actions following site-specific conversion of
testosterone to estradiol. The circuit is comprised of the posterior nucleus of the amygdala (PA) and the ventral
premammillary nucleus (PMv). The PA relays conspecific olfactory signals and is highly relevant for human’s
physical and sexual health. Functional neuroimaging studies, neurological insults or brain lesions have shown
that the PA has a critical role in sexual drive, hyper- or hyposexuality, and sexual disorders (e.g., paraphilias)
in a sex specific mode. The PA densely projects to the PMv which has a fundamental role in the modulation of
the neuroendocrine reproductive axis. Our goal is to determine the role of AR in specific brain nuclei of male
and female mice focused on the integration of environmental signals, sexual behavior, and neuroendocrine
control. We hypothesize that AR in PA neurons is necessary for sex recognition, and sexual arousal, and that
PA inputs to PMv AR neurons connect sexual arousal to neuroendocrine (gonadotropins) and behavioral
responses. We will employ Cre-loxP and FlpO-Frt approaches to conditionally delete Ar in these neuronal
populations, viral vectors, TeTox and DREADDs technology to remotely silence or activate AR expressing
neurons, different steroids milieu, and molecular mapping of chemically defined AR neurons in two
independent aims. Our findings will open new opportunities for a better understanding of the mechanisms
associated with the pathophysiology of altered levels of androgens mediated by neuronal AR. Unraveling the
role of AR in defined neuronal circuitry is an essential step toward the prevention of adverse health
consequences caused by hyper- or hypoandrogenism in a sex-specific manner."
10817135,"Project Summary:
Deficits in olfaction were recognized decades ago as early symptoms in people with incipient Alzheimer’s
Disease. However, these discoveries have had less impact than hoped on the study, diagnosis, and treatment
of this disease. Though central nervous system olfactory pathways suffer the plaques and/or tangles that are
characteristic of late-stage disease, these symptoms do not set the olfactory system apart from other foci of
research into Alzheimer’s Disease. Perhaps because the regenerative capacity of the olfactory epithelium
obscured the vulnerability of olfactory sensory neurons to Alzheimer’s Disease, especially the early events
leading to the neurodegeneration characteristic of the disease, study of how the olfactory epithelium is
impacted by Alzheimer’s Disease languished. Clear evidence that the olfactory sensory neurons in the
epithelium are susceptible to factors that cause or increase risk of Alzheimer’s Disease has recently emerged,
however. These findings demonstrate that the olfactory epithelium is a worthy model of how risk factors for
Alzheimer’s Disease affect neurons and their supporting cells. Thus far the data correlate well with effects in
the brain, evidence that the olfactory epithelium may be a bellwether for events transpiring in the central
nervous system. The accessibility of the olfactory epithelium for biopsy to assess disease progression in
individuals and to drugs that cannot pass the blood brain barrier further elevates the significance of the
olfactory epithelium as a model. This project investigates the effects of a critical risk factor for Alzheimer’s
Disease, APOE genotype, on the olfactory epithelium and its olfactory sensory neurons. The experiments
focus on identifying early events and the strength of their effects on phenotype and function. It uses mouse
models of the disease, including established genetic models previously used to investigate effects in the brain
and a novel model that allows switching at will from a neurodegenerative genotype to a neuroprotective
genotype. The latter allows testing of whether cellular and molecular events associated with vulnerability to
Alzheimer’s Disease can be prevented or reversed by in vivo genetic manipulation, outcomes that would inform
and inspire further work towards curing this disease."
10814936,"Defects in systolic (S) and diastolic (D) blood pressure (BP) regulation underlie clinical hypertension and its
subsequent target organ damage when unrecognized and untreated. Over the past 15 years, we have been major
contributors to the genomic analyses of BP enabling dissection of inter-individual SBP and DBP variation,
through this FEHGAS research program in collaboration with national/international consortia. While the
major approach has been to further expand GWAS, in this renewal (FEHGAS4), we introduce an alternative
novel program of using genome-cum-epigenome screens to quantify the contributions of each tissue and cell
type to causal BP variation through their transcription factors (TFs), cognate cis regulatory elements (CREs)
and target genes, organized into gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Our preliminary studies suggest significant
contributions by arterial-, heart-, adrenal- and kidney- specific regulatory variants in decreasing order. In this
proposal we ask: (1) Which tissues and cell types contribute to SBP and DBP variation between humans? (2)
Which genes in a tissue/cell type contribute to human SBP and DBP control? (3) What is the functional
architecture of inter-individual SBP and DBP variation? (4) What is the differential tissue contribution to risk.

10908373,"ABSTRACT:
Teeth function under high repetitive masticatory loads throughout lifetime. They need to quickly adapt to food in
different sizes and consistencies in order to enable an efficient masticatory process. This quick adaptation
capability is provided by a unique soft tissue that connects the tooth to the alveolar bone, the periodontal ligament
(PDL). The PDL, therefore, is critical for proper tooth function and survival. At present, there are different
solutions for restoring teeth and alveolar bone structure to different extents but no predictable methods exist for
restoring the PDL. This proposal will establish a platform for a regeneration therapy for the PDL. The PDL is a
non-uniform tissue, we recently identify a unique structure of dense collagen network at the most coronal part of
the PDL and coined the term dense collar. This region is consists of dense, short horizontal fibers with a
directionality preference that corresponds to natural drift direction of the tooth. Our recent studies show higher
stiffness of the dense collar when compared to the furcation region in the PDL as well as unique composition.
We therefore hypothesize that the dense collar is a central contributor to the overall tooth stability and therefore
any impairment to the dense collar structure will affect the entire PDL function. To test this hypothesis we will
take a multidisciplinary approach investigating the structure and function of this tissue and its role in the entire
PDL function and tooth stability. We will generate a base line of the ECM and cellular profile of this region in
comparison to other regions in the PDL using localized proteomics and mass cytometry. We will measure the
mechanical properties of the dense collar using high frequency AFM and tooth mobility using an in-situ loading
device and we will unravel the collagen structure using a novel in-situ Raman spectroscopy and our microCT
based method for soft tissue imaging. We will combine theses cutting edge methodologies utilizing unfixed
samples with minimal sectioning to enable sample collection with their 3D structural context. We will then test
the effect of different interventions to the structural integrity of the dense collar on tooth mobility. We will use a
modified pre-periodontitis model and orthodontic tooth movement in mice model and compare the structural and
mechanical properties of the dense collar to the base line. In the last stage we will identify a method to strengthen
the dense collar to increase tooth stability. This proposal will determine the role of the dense collar in tooth
stability and the association between structural changes in the dense collar and overall PDL function. Most
importantly, unraveling the structure and function of a specific region within the PDL will generate a platform for
structural interventions to reinforce this region and control the entire PDL function and tooth stability. This
proposal will lay the ground to a paradigm shift in different dental fields such as orthodontics, dental trauma, and
periodontics."

 As a result of 3.5 years of successfully awarding and supporting developmental projects (3 cohorts),
mentoring new investigators, and other supporting activities as a D-ARC, the Dev Core proposes to extend our
work as a Full ARC, building and sustaining the growth of investigators pursuing mental health (MH) and HIV
research. The focus continues to be on community engaged research mitigating the disparities experienced by
racial/ethnic, sexual, and gender minority populations.
 The Dev Core Awards Program will support Early Stage Investigators (ESI), established investigators new
to MH/HIV, and community stakeholders, in pursuing community-engaged, MH/HIV research focused on
mitigating health disparities. We will offer traditional Pilot Awards, Scholar Awards that emphasizes research
skills development and investigator time for research, Community Pilot Awards in partnership with the MHD-CE
Core, and Program Planning Micro-Grants in partnership with the EIS Core. We will expand eligibility for the
Pilot and Scholar Awards to investigators from other regional institutions: Florida State University, Florida
International University, and Nova Southeastern University. At least one Pilot or Scholar Award each year will
be implementation science-focused, with priority areas informed by the EIS Core. The Dev Core coordinates
the review of each award, and we systematically track and support the progress of awardees and support
those who are not selected in revising their proposals for future funding mechanisms.
 The comprehensive mentoring program encompasses our efforts to support the career development of ESI
and underrepresented minority (URM) scientists. We facilitate the efforts by assembling a mentoring team
(through the Mentoring Advisory Committee) and pursue comprehensive individual development plans (IDP).
Career development of ESIs is further supported by our contributions to ongoing career development and grant
writing workshops in synergy with other Cores and research Centers at UM and beyond. Other Dev Core
activities include technical assistance and pre-submission peer reviews of grants and manuscripts, catalyzing
the success of CHARM scientists across the career development spectrum from pre- and post-doctoral

 The interdisciplinary Dev Core Directors, all underrepresented racial/ethnic minority investigators, and
cross-institutional contributors are crucial to the success of the overall mission and scientific Aims of CHARM,
the only NIMH (D-)ARC in the Southeastern United States. With respect to legacy planning, Core leaders
include a senior level Director (Behar-Zusman) an Associate Professor Co-Director (McIntosh), and a mid-
career Professor (Educator Track) Training Director (Horigian). The Dev Core provides crucial resources to
reinvigorate MH/HIV research in a region that is among the most heavily affected by the epidemic."
10804660,"Summary
Despite technological advancements in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) radiotherapies,
collateral damage to surrounding normal tissues such as salivary glands following ionizing radiation (IR) remains
a significant problem for these patients and severely diminishes their quality of life. It is estimated that >95% of
HNSCC patients exhibit xerostomia and salivary gland hypofunction following the irradiation regimen and >73%
of these patients continue to suffer for months to years after completion of radiotherapy. The lack of treatment
options to prevent IR-induced xerostomia or recover salivary function is compounded by a limited understanding
of the underlying mechanisms that mediate chronic IR-induced salivary dysfunction. Our previous studies
demonstrate the action of extracellular ATP (eATP), a key “alarmin” molecule in damaged tissue that contributes
to IR-induced salivary dysfunction, can be inhibited by pharmacological or genetic blockade of P2X7Rs for eATP,
thereby conferring significant radioprotection to salivary glands. In addition, our studies show that radioprotection
from P2X7R antagonism maintains normal salivary output through day 30 post-IR, although longer time periods
relevant to the treatment of IR-induced chronic xerostomia and salivary dysfunction have not been investigated.
Our ultimate goal is to use P2X7R antagonists as radioprotective agents to retain salivary gland function in head
and neck cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy, although there is little information available on whether
P2X7R antagonists will interfere with tumor regression achieved by radiotherapy, and proposed studies will
address this gap in knowledge. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop an approach using P2X7R
antagonism to prevent IR-induced salivary dysfunction in head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy
without inhibiting the IR-induced regression of HNSCC tumors. Successful completion of this proposal will greatly
accelerate translation of this novel pharmacological approach to human patients undergoing IR therapies for
head and neck cancer. The following specific aims will be pursued:
Specific Aim 1 will develop a radioprotective approach using P2X7R antagonism in an irradiated syngeneic
mouse model of HNSCC that preserves salivary gland function and anti-tumor responses.
Specific Aim 2 will investigate the durability of the radioprotective effects of P2X7R antagonism towards
developing an approach for chronic salivary dysfunction that occurs in HNSCC patients following radiotherapy.
Specific Aim 3 will evaluate the contribution of eATP release and purinomic signaling downstream of P2X7R
activation to IR-induced salivary gland dysfunction in mouse and human salivary gland organotypic cultures
towards identifying alternative radioprotective targets and translating findings in mice to humans."
10815585,"This proposal is aimed to test our novel hypothesis that the cytochrome P450 (CYP)1B1-generated
metabolites of 17b-estradiol (E2) (2-methoxyestradiol, 2-ME) and testosterone (T) (6b-hydroxytestosterone,
6b-OHT) inhibit and enhance, respectively, Ang II-induced production of prohypertensive arachidonic acid
(AA)-12/15 lipoxygenase (ALOX15)/12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) and Cyp4a/20-HETE
metabolites in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and that this mechanism accounts for the sex differences in
Ang II-induced hypertension, i.e., a lesser increase in blood pressure (BP) in females than males. This
hypothesis is based on our compelling preliminary data that transduction of PVN with adenovirus (Ad)-
ALOX15, and Ad-Cyp4a10/Cyp4a12a-shRNA, respectively, a) ameliorate Ang II-induced increase in BP in
both wild-type (WT) female and male mice; b) attenuate the effect of Ang II to enhance BP, in CYP1B1 gene
disrupted (Cyp1b1–/–) female mice that lack 2-ME; and c) minimize the 6b-OHT effect to restore Ang II-induced
increase in BP that is diminished in Cyp1b1–/– male mice lacking endogenous 6b-OHT. We will expand these
observations to test our hypothesis by addressing the following specific aims. Aim 1. To determine contribution
of the central AA/LOX15 system to Ang II-induced hypertension and its pathogenesis in female and male mice.
Sub-Aim 1. To examine interaction of the central AA/LOX15 system and CYP1B1-generated E2 and T
metabolites in Ang II-induced hypertension and its pathogenesis in female and male mice. Aim 2. To examine
contribution of the central AA/Cyp4a10 and Cyp4a12a systems to Ang II-induced hypertension and its
pathogenesis in female and male mice. Sub-Aim 2. To determine interaction of the central AA/Cyp4a10 and
Cyp4a12a systems and CYP1B1-generated E2 and T metabolites in Ang II-induced hypertension and its
pathogenesis in females and male mice. To achieve these aims, we will use the state-of-the-art techniques,
which include: a) Radiotelemetry for measuring BP; b) wild-type and Alox15–/–, Cyp1b1–/–, and cPLA2a–/–
female and male mice; c) Ad-ALOX15-shRNA, Ad-Cyp4a10, and Ad-Cyp4a12a-shRNA and respective Ad-
scrambled shRNA controls, and their Ad-DNA and Ad-GFP-DNA control, and 12(S)-HETE Gpr31 and Ltb4r2
and 20-HETE Gpr75 receptor siRNAs and their non-target siRNA; d) Histological, immunohistochemical, and
fluorescence microscopy and biochemical techniques; e) Flow cytometry to determine immune cell infiltration
in aorta, kidney and brain; f) UPLC/qTOF MS for the analysis of sex steroids and eicosanoids. The proposed
studies will provide insights into the molecular mechanism underlying sex differences determined by the
interaction of CYP1B1-generated metabolites of sex steroids and AA/ALOX15- and Cyp4a systems in the PVN
in Ang II-induced hypertension and associated pathogenesis. Moreover, these studies should identify central
ALOX15 and Cyp4a as a potential site of action of the selective inhibitors of these enzyme systems and 12(S)-
HETE and 20-HETE receptor antagonists for treating hypertension and its pathogenesis in both sexes."
10805448,"Obstructed defecation (OD), defined as incomplete emptying of stool, is a widely prevalent
disorder in women’s health and resulting in major quality of life (QOL) and healthcare burden.
Successful management has been impaired, historically, by deficiencies relating to both
diagnosis and treatment. First, there has been a persistent misconception that OD in the
absence of dyssynergia (i.e., uncoordinated contraction of pelvic floor) results from prolapse of
the posterior vaginal wall (‘rectocele’) and improves after its repair. In fact, prior studies have
confirmed that this form of OD results from support defects involving the rectum rather than
vagina (8-10), and moreover that rectocele repairs are unreliable in relieving OD symptoms.
Recent work from our center confirmed rectal detachment and hypermobility to be the major
determinants of OD in the irrespective of the presence of a rectocele. Secondly, traditional
diagnostic modalities to asses rectal support as the source of OD are expensive (e.g. MRI
defecography) and/or invasive (e.g. anal manometry), and often generate findings with unclear
clinical correlation and impact on care. Finally, available surgeries to repair rectal support
defects have been limited to invasive transabdominal or perineal methods, typically involving
mesh implantation and reserved for severe cases, e.g. those with overt rectal prolapse.
Laparoscopic or open ventral mesh rectopexy is the most widely accepted operation to stabilize
rectal support.
We are testing the hypothesis that OD symptoms in the absence of dyssynergia primarily
result from deficiencies in rectal support and that patients presenting OD symptoms with or
without vaginal prolapse undergoing our new diagnostic evaluation and surgical treatment will
have improved outcomes relative to the current standard of care at 2 years after surgery. Our
study is designed to evaluate primary and secondary outcomes relating to the two rectopexy
procedures on OD at 2 years follow up across two institutions. This clinical data will be
complemented by a computational modeling approach that aims to provide insight into the most
likely contributors to OD symptoms, i.e. vaginal versus rectal support defects. Aim 1: Compare
occult rectal hypermobility as measured using posterior compartment dynamic ultrasound imaging
versus MR defecography. Posterior compartment dynamic ultrasound is a novel approach for
identifying the underlying anatomic cause of OD in women suffering from OD symptoms without
coexisting functional bowel disorders (e.g. normal BM frequency and stool type, and absence of
dyssynergia). Aim 2: Compare anatomic, functional, and health-related quality of life outcomes
in female subjects with moderate to severe OD symptoms, and rectal hypermobility diagnosed by
ultrasound, who are randomized to minimally invasive transvaginal rectopexy versus abdominal
ventral rectopexy at 2 years after surgery. Aim 3: Develop and validate a computational finite
element model and statistical shape modeling approach to describe the mechanics of normal
defecation and the role of rectal and vaginal support deficiencies in causing OD symptoms."
10911820,"ABSTRACT
Chronic wounds represent a major healthcare burden. One of the common complications of non-
healing chronic diabetic wounds is stalled inflammation. Mechanisms underlying such derailed
immune responses are therefore of extraordinary interest. This proposal rests on our novel
observation that keratinocytes (κ) of the wound-edge tissue cross-talk with visiting macrophages
via κ-originating exosomes which carry genetic information to wound-site macrophages in a highly
organized and directed manner. EXOmotif in genes selects them for exosomal packaging. We
propose that miR-21 is one such non-coding gene the precursor of which, pre-miR-21, is
packaged in κ-originating exosomes and delivered to wound macrophages to resolve
inflammation in a timely manner. This process of cross-talk is compromised in diabetes. We
observed that surface protein chemistry of a specific κ-originating exosomal subset, i.e. presence
of mannose favors uptake by wound macrophages. Diabetes modifies this surface protein
chemistry causing mannose modifications thus compromising the uptake of these exosomes by
wound macrophages. The following three specific aims are thus proposed: Aim 1. Determine
whether exosomal miR-21 transfer from keratinocyte to macrophage is compromised in diabetic
wound-edge tissue 1.1 Uptake of keratinocyte-originating miR-21 (pre and mature) loaded
exosomes by wound-site macrophages (wmφ) is compromised under conditions of diabetes.
1.2 Compromised keratinocyte-macrophage cross-talk in diabetic wound impairs resolution of
inflammation. Aim 2. Test whether surface glycoproteins of keratinocyte-derived exosomes from
the wound site are glycosylated under conditions of diabetes impairing macrophage targeting.
2.1 Mannose, on the surface of κ-GFPEXO at the wound site, is glycosylated under conditions of
diabetes such that the uptake by macrophages is impaired 2.2 Wound-edge κ-GFPEXO
undergoes mannose isomerization under conditions of diabetes. Aim 3. Isolate keratinocyte-
originating exosomes (HuK14EXO) from human chronic wound fluid (cWF) from patients with
diabetes to determine whether these exosomes contain lower miR-21 (pre and mature)
compared to those from patients without diabetes. Aim 3 tests the significance of the findings of
Aim 1 in a patient setting. This resubmitted proposal from an early-stage investigator is aimed at
laying the foundation of a laboratory dedicated to studying the cell-specific origin of exosomal
subsets in bodily fluids, their targeting/homing in other cells/tissues, and functional significance.
The premise of such work is that malfunction of such processes is implicated in diabetic
complications and that rescue strategies can only be developed if underlying processes are
understood."
10802377,"Summary
Time-of-flight positron emission tomography is a very effective nuclear imaging modality for the diagnosis and
staging of a range of pathologies such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, or musculoskeletal disorders.
Commercial TOF-PET scanners currently employ lutetium-(yttrium)-oxyorthosilicate (L(Y)SO) crystal detectors
coupled to silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) to achieve coincidence time resolutions (CTR) between 200-500 ps
full width at half maximum (FWHM).
High production costs of L(Y)SO crystals and their intrinsic radiation background are currently hindering the
evolution and spread of very promising TOF-PET modalities such as long axial field-of-view (LA-FOV) scanners
or studies involving very low doses such as cell tracking or imaging with theranostic agents. New scintillator
materials with lower production cost, radiation background-free, and with TOF-level timing accuracy are needed.
We propose to use thallium chloride (TlCl) as a scintillator material for TOF-PET. TlCl is a material with a simple
cubic structure that allows for a relatively easy and flexible doping process. Preliminary data obtained with TlCl
crystals doped with beryllium (Be) and indium (I) show a very fast scintillation component of ~10 ns that has a
high potential for very accurate timing measurements. TlCl has a greater detection efficiency than LYSO or even
bismuth germanate (BGO) for 511 keV gammas, is background radiation-free, and its estimated production cost
is 1/3 of L(Y)SO based on its low melting point of 430C (compared to 2050C for L(Y)SO) and simple lattice
structure. Moreover, unlike BGO, TlCl uniquely combines a very fast scintillation process with a high Cherenkov
generation yield to further boost timing potential.
We aim to prove the feasibility of using TlCl detectors for TOF-PET by combining expertise in crystal growth,
simulation of light generation and detection, and benchtop characterization. First, will study the effects of Be and
I as dopants in TlCl with the aim of further improve the scintillation properties observed in the preliminary data.
We will also optimize the surface treatment of TlCl to maximize the light extraction toward the photodetector.
Second, we will develop a simulation framework that allows us to guide the crystal development process and to
understand the fundamental timing limits of TlCl. Third, we will characterize individual TlCl crystals with different
choices of photodetectors to evaluate their timing and energy resolution accuracy. Results obtained with these
crystals will be used to tune and validate the simulation model as well. Finally, we will evaluate the performance
of TlCl detector blocks of 4x4 crystal elements. We will evaluate their timing resolution, depth-of-interaction
estimation accuracy, and quality of flood histograms."
10782544,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Asthma results from a complex interplay between genetic background and environmental
triggers. The 17q21 asthma susceptibility locus is strongly linked to childhood asthma through
ORMDL3. ORMDL3 regulates serine-palmitoyl CoA transferase (SPT), the critical enzyme for
the de novo synthesis of sphingolipids. We demonstrated that decreased SPT activity leads to
airway hyperreactivity. There has since been increasing evidence that sphingolipid metabolism
is altered in airway epithelial cells and animal models of ORMDL3-associated asthma. We have
recently shown that children with asthma have decreased sphingolipid synthesis, especially in
the presence of asthma risk 17q21 genotypes. 17q21 genotypes are also linked to the risk of
developing asthma following respiratory infections with human rhinovirus (HRV). This is relevant
as HRV is also the most common trigger for asthma attacks.
Supported by preliminary data in mice and airway epithelial cells demonstrating strong
similarities in sphingolipid levels and gene expression between HRV infection and sphingolipid
deficiency, we hypothesize that HRV infection can further impair sphingolipid synthesis. We
propose to study the effects of HRV on sphingolipid synthesis in children with asthma and
airway epithelial cells. These studies could then further solidify the central role of sphingolipids
in asthma pathogenesis that has been predicted by the commonality and the strong association
of 17q21 genotypes to asthma. Two specific aims are proposed to assess the overall hypothesis
that the sphingolipid de novo synthesis pathway is critical not only for asthma pathogenesis but
also in response to the most common trigger for asthma attacks. In Aim 1, we will determine
sphingolipid synthesis in the respiratory tract in children with asthma and HRV infection.
Sphingolipids will be assessed in nasal fluid, blood, and gene expression in nasal cells obtained
from children during and after the resolution of HRV-triggered asthma attacks. In a subaim, we
will evaluate the effects of HRV on sphingolipid metabolism and gene expression in primary
human airway epithelial cells (HAEC) with homozygous for a common 17q21 asthma variation
that leads to decreased blood sphingolipids in children with asthma. HAEC from an established
biorepository from adult donors and nasal brushings from children all grown at air-liquid
interface will be infected with HRV and RSV and evaluated for effects on sphingolipid synthesis.
For Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that the altered ratio of the sphingolipid mediator
sphingosine 1-phosphate and sphinganine 1 phosphate, which we found in SPT deficiency and
children with the 17q21 asthma risk genotypes, leads to airway hyperreactivity. Overall, these
studies not only inform on the role of sphingolipids in the pathogenesis of asthma and the
relation to its most common trigger but may lead to new therapeutic approaches involving
sphingolipid metabolism."

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen found in acute infections (burns, wounds, ventilator
associated pneumonia, eye infections) and chronic infections of the foot (diabetic ulcers) and lung (cystic
fibrosis). This bacterium commonly survives in these contexts as a biofilm, the formation and high-level
antibiotic tolerance of which interferes with effective patient treatment. A defining aspect of P. aeruginosa is its
ability to make pyocyanin, a colorful redox-active pigment that contributes to biofilm development and its
fitness in the context of infection. Pyocyanin has been detected at appreciable concentrations in skin wounds
and in cystic fibrosis sputum, and pyocyanin has been shown to be a virulence factor in animal infection
models. Pyocyanin exerts a range of effects over the cells that produce it, ranging from toxic in the presence of
oxygen to beneficial in its absence; under oxygen-limited conditions, pyocyanin serves as an electron acceptor
that promotes redox-balancing and long-term survival. These toxic and beneficial roles are important at
different times in biofilm development, with early pyocyanin -promoted lysis generating extracellular DNA
(eDNA), a key component of the biofilm matrix together with exopolysaccharides. Recently, we determined that
eDNA underpins pyocyanin’s ability to promote extracellular electron transfer (EET) within biofilms, facilitating
metabolic activity in the oxygen-limited interior. We found that eDNA enables both the retention of pyocyanin
and charge transfer to pyocyanin. Critical to making these discoveries was our development of new
bioelectrochemical technologies and approaches and the application of advanced spectroscopic techniques to
directly probe EET in biofilms. We now seek to extend our interdisciplinary work to gain a mechanistic
understanding of how biofilm EET efficiency is tuned by the composition of the matrix and the consequences
this may have for antibiotic tolerance. Does the ratio of certain exopolysaccharides (Pel, Psl) to eDNA
modulate pyocyanin diffusivity in the matrix, controlling EET efficiency? Does EET efficiency correlate with the
rate of redox balancing in the biofilm interior? How do pyocyanin-mediated cellular effects, including EET,
contribute to antibiotic tolerance in biofilms, and do these mechanisms differ according to the amount of
oxygen in the microenvironment? Does the relative sensitivity of diverse pyocyanin-producing P. aeruginosa
isolates to antibiotics correlate with their matrix composition and EET efficiency? Aim1 will explore how the
matrix composition, particularly the ratio of Pel and Psl exopolysaccharides to eDNA, determines EET
efficiency. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that pyocyanin is a versatile intrinsic tolerance factor, where PYO-EET
helps P. aeruginosa biofilms tolerate mechanistically distinct and clinically important antibiotic classes via
bioenergetic effects and/or by inducing defense mechanisms; we predict the dominant mechanism by which
PYO impacts tolerance will differ as a function of oxygen concentration. Attainment of these objectives will lay
the foundation of basic knowledge necessary to design better strategies to control P. aeruginosa biofilms."

Survival outcomes for patients with osteosarcoma have not changed since the advent of modern chemotherapy
four decades ago and it has been challenging to develop new effective therapies in this disease. Our lab’s long-
term mission is to identify novel molecular targets in osteosarcoma via comprehensive genomic and proteomic
profiling of patient-derived cell lines and xenografts as well as human tumors with the ultimate goal of identifying
and/or developing and testing therapeutics against these targets. To achieve this goal, we have a) built a robust
profiling platform to identify novel targets; b) expanded our repertoire of osteosarcoma patient derived xenograft
(PDX) models to reflect disease heterogeneity; and c) conducted high-throughput in vivo testing of 8-10 new
agents each year both as part of Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium (PPTC) as well as independent of it.
All of these efforts form the basis of our current research proposal and place us strongly poised to successfully
achieve our goals.
Our overall objective is to efficiently evaluate the efficacy of new agents with high potential to have activity in
osteosarcoma based on target data from our genomic and proteomic profiling both as single agents and in
rational combinations, with the vision of moving effective agents into clinical trials through the Children’s
Oncology Group. We have three specific aims- 1) to select and test agents in vivo against surface targets
identified by comprehensive proteomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; 2) to select and
test agents in vivo against targets identified by comprehensive genomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts
and patient tumors; and 3) to perform testing of rationally combined agents based on target, toxicity and efficacy
data of single agents.
Agents from the PPTC pipeline will be selected based on either the proteomic target or genomic alteration being
present in at least a subset of available osteosarcoma PDX models. The agent will be tested in selected cohorts
of low/ high expressing protein target or present/ absent genomic alteration. In cases with multiple models with
target expression, 3-5 mice per model will be used and in cases with few models available, 8-10 mice per model
will be used for control and experiment groups with an overall n per arm per experiment of approximately 30
mice. Standard PPTC procedures will be used for tumor implantation and treatment. Tumor dimensions will be
measured twice a week and response quantified as per standard PPTC definitions of complete response,
maintained complete response, partial response, stable disease and progressive disease. For combination
studies, three potential types of combinations will be considered based on efficacy and toxicity data- a) two
surface protein targeted agents such as two antibody-drug conjugates; 2) two molecularly targeted agents and
3) a surface protein targeted agent and a molecularly targeted agent. Our results will guide the development of
the next generation of clinical trials in osteosarcoma."
10881912,"PROJECT SUMMARY
One common pathologic hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related tauopathies is the abundant
presence of abnormal aggregates of highly phosphorylated tau protein in the brain parenchyma. Because the
etiology of the vast majority of these cases (late-onset) is not known, currently there are no effective
preventative measures or therapeutic approaches against them. Considering the increasing number of
individuals affected by these disorders there is a sense of urgency to identify the mechanisms responsible for
the onset and development of their neuroptahologic phenotype.
Recently, small non-coding RNAs, also called microRNAs (miRNAs), have emerged as important post-
transcriptional master regulators of several key cellular processes involved in neurodegeneration.
Consistent data in the literature showed that miRNAs are dysregulated in AD and related tauopathies.
However, since these studies typically assessed a single time point in the disease evolution they did not
address whether the changes antecede or follow the onset of the pathology. Using an unbiased approach, in
our preliminary studies we discovered an age-dependent increase in the expression levels of a specific
miRNA, miRNA22-3p, in the hippocampus of a relevant mouse model of tauopathy at an early stage of its
phenotype. Importantly, we confirmed this observation also in post-mortem human tauopathy brain tissues
when compared with age-matched healthy controls. Additional studies revealed that this miRNA directly
modulates pathologic tau accumulation. The hierarchical hypothesis of this research program is that miRNA22-
3p directly contributes to the tauopathy pathogenesis through regulation of specific targets involved in tau
metabolic pathways, and that the modulation of its level represents a new therapeutic approach for the
treatment of these diseases.
To test our hypothesis, we will over-express miRNA22-3p in a relevant tauopathy mouse model (Specific Aim
1) and down-regulate miRNA22-3p expression levels in the same model (Specific Aim 2). In order to establish
its cellular source and contribution to the tau phenotype, we will generate tauopathy mouse models with cell-
specific miRNA22-3p deficiency (Specific Aim 3). In all these models we will assess the effects and
mechanisms of manipulating this specific miRNA level on tau neuropathologic phenotype and cognitive
functions.
Overall the long-term goal of our research proposal is to establish the functional role that miRNA22-3p plays in
the pathophysiology of AD and related tauopathies, and ultimately by identifying its biological targets to
develop novel and viable therapeutic tools and strategies against these devastating diseases."
10881915,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Finding a resolving cure for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an urgent critical need and there is ample consensus
that successful treatments should target early disease events. Among these, synaptic dysfunction induced by
soluble oligomers of tau (TauO) is recognized as one of the earliest key events in AD and related disorders,
where disease-specific TauO conformers (strains) may drive the diverse clinical presentations. Thus, blocking
synaptic demise induced by TauO conformers is a highly desirable therapeutic strategy, its potential
effectiveness supported by the existence of resilient individuals who remain Non-Demented despite the CNS
presence of late-stage Braak AD Neuropathology (here termed NDAN) that present with functional synapses
devoid of TauO. Notably, late Braak stage pathology paralleled by intact synapses in NDAN suggests the novel
concept that trans-synaptic spreading of tau and tau-driven synaptic toxicity are two distinct phenomena that
coexist in AD and other symptomatic tauopathies but not in NDAN, where the toxic impact of TauO on synapses
(but not spreading) is curbed. While such evidence indicates that rejecting synaptic tau toxic impact as a
protective mechanism can be effectively enabled in the human brain despite the spread of AD neuropathology,
a therapeutic strategy to achieve such a game-changing goal remains missing. Filling this critical knowledge gap
by laying the molecular foundations for the development of such therapeutic strategy is the overall objective of
the present project. Our central hypothesis is that dysfunctional engagement of synapses by TauO is determined
by the type of tau strain and its binding to LRP1 (a synaptic receptor essential for tau uptake and spreading),
which differentially affects LRP1-containing protein complexes in vulnerable vs. resilient synapses. We will test
our central hypothesis by evaluating binding dynamic and functional impact of disease-specific brain-derived
TauO conformers on human synapses as a function of LRP1-mediated toxicity (Aim 1) and by evaluating the
functional response of human synapses from different tauopathies (AD, PSP) and resilience status (NDAN,
PART) to TauO as a function of the synaptic LRP1 (Aim 2). At the completion of the proposed studies, we expect
to have documented a previously unappreciated mechanism of synaptic interaction of TauO conformers as well
as a phenomenon of synaptic resistance modulated by LRP1. This discovery will have a significant impact in the
development of an innovative treatment concept for AD centered on sustaining synaptic resistance to
toxic oligomers, a strategy expected effective as demonstrated by NDAN subjects. A uniquely qualified
investigative team has been assembled to successfully accomplish this project, bringing together expertise in
AD molecular neurobiology (Taglialatela), human synaptic physiology (Limon) and function (Krishnan) and
biochemistry of tau oligomers (Kayed)."
10823297,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Aggregation of Aβ protein plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Aβ aggregation
leads to the formation of soluble oligomers and insoluble fibrils. While amyloid fibrils are the main component
of parenchymal plaques in Alzheimer's disease brains, the Aβ oligomers have been widely regarded as more
toxic and more pathologically relevant. There is strong evidence supporting that at least some types of Aβ
oligomers can undergo a conformational conversion to form fibrils. It is yet poorly understood how the
oligomers could re-arrange their structures to form fibrils. In this proposed project, we will use a combination of
electron and nuclear magnetic resonance to monitor structural changes during Aβ42 oligomer-to-fibril
conversion. The Aβ42 oligomers will be prepared in the presence of low concentrations of detergent. These
Aβ42 oligomers represent a type of stable oligomers, which convert to fibrils only in the presence of lipid
vesicles. The oligomer-to-fibril conversion will be followed by performing EPR and NMR experiments at
different time points. This study will provide insights into whether oligomers dissociate to monomers, which
then nucleate to form fibril nuclei, or oligomers transition to the structure of fibril nuclei without dissociation. We
will not only delineate the mechanism of Aβ aggregation, but also shed light on how to modulate this process
as a way of therapeutic intervention."
10844428,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Blacks/African-Americans (blacks) have two times the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD) compared to
non-Hispanic whites (whites), in part attributable to the higher prevalence of vascular risk factors. Examining
other risk factors and delineating pathological mechanisms associated with this higher AD-risk in older blacks is
a critical initial step needed to optimize patient care paradigms. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is one such risk
factor. Notably, blacks have a higher burden of OSA with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), which is associated
with longitudinal amyloid-PET uptake. OSA is associated with decreased non rapid eye movement (NREM) slow
wave sleep/activity (SWS/SWA) and increased inflammation, both of which affect amyloid and tau pathology.
NREM SWS/SWA and inflammation are also associated with changes in cognition in late-life, and are more
burdensome in blacks. The current proposal will utilize a health disparities research framework related to aging
to: (i) investigate within and between race effects of OSA on AD pathology. (ii) Identify decreased NREM
SWS/SWA and increased inflammation as potential intermediate mechanisms linking OSA and AD. (iii)
Examine whether socio-structural determinants of health (SDOH) can help explain racial heterogeneity in OSA-
AD outcomes. Our
neurodegeneration,
central hypothesis is that black OSA subjects will exhibit higher tau and greater
as well as reduced NREM SWS/SWA and increased inflammation compared to white OSA
subjects, in the context of amyloid burden. Furthermore, we hypothesize SDOH (i.e., environmental, socio-
structural, and behavioral factors) and vascular risk will mediate racial heterogeneity in OSA-AD outcomes. We
will test our central hypothesis in a sample of 300 community-dwelling cognitively normal (CN) subjects; ages
55-85 matched on race (2:1), age and sex, and balanced by education, income and BMI. Subjects will include 150
controls (100 blacks & 50 whites), and 150 newly diagnosed OSA subjects with EDS (100 blacks & 50 whites).
This proposal will recruit from the community, 125 new black subjects [80 OSA and 45 controls] and leverage
existing data and resources in 175 (75 blacks [20 OSA and 55 controls] & 100 whites [50 OSA and 50 controls])
community-dwelling CN subjects with similar eligibility criteria, from NYU Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center
and two-affiliated ongoing NIH supported R01 studies (R01AG056031 and R01AG056531). Subjects will
undergo 2 nights of at-home sleep monitoring for OSA, followed by 5 days of actigraphy and sleep logs. Clinical
visits will include full clinical evaluation, neuropsychological tests and clinical labs on visit 1; 1 night of nocturnal
polysomnography (NPSG) recording on visit 2; neuroimaging measures of vascular burden, amyloid (18F-
florbetaben) and tau (18F-PI2620) PET-MRI on visits 3 and 4 respectively, at baseline and at 2.5 years follow-up.
Importantly, we will prioritize acquisition of SDOH data to elucidate disease mechanisms to aid future discovery
of novel AD prevention targets e.g. targeting stress management, inflammation and sleep quality in OSA."

Young investigators are critical to maintaining the physician-scientist workforce, but keeping this pipeline robust
faces a myriad of challenges. These include expanding bureaucracy, greater clinical demands, diminishing
research time, rapid pace of advancement in basic science, and limited funding for research training. To create
a more seamless pipeline for physician-scientist training in Neurosurgery and Neurology at Washington
University School of Medicine (WUSM), we have established this Research Education Program that aims to train
and develop the future generation of neurosurgeon- and neurologist-scientists essential for future advances in
basic, translational, and clinical neuroscience.
The structure of the Research Education Program proposed in this renewal application builds upon the strengths
and successes of our original program, but changes it in one fundamental way – the program is now expanded
to include both neurosurgery and neurology faculty and trainees. In the first iteration of our program, we focused
solely on preparing neurosurgeon-scientists for independent investigative careers. In the current application, we
now propose to prepare both neurosurgeon- and neurologist-scientists for investigative careers by enlisting full
participation and leadership from the Department of Neurology at WUSM. What has not changed is the
overarching goal of the WUSM Resident Education Program: to recruit and prepare the next generation of
physician-neuroscientists so that they successfully compete for the best junior faculty positions in the country,
secure extramural career development funding including K series grants from the NIH, and ultimately become
highly successful physician-scientists.
The Departments of Neurosurgery and Neurology at WUSM provide an excellent institutional environment for
basic, translational, and clinical neuroscience research and education. Both departments have long and
distinguished track records of training academic physician-neuroscientists spanning many decades. This
success has been particularly strong over the past 10 years. In Neurosurgery, over 70% of graduates have
entered academic practice and nearly 20% of graduates have become successful NIH-funded neurosurgeon-
scientists. In Neurology, 66% of graduates have taken positions at academic medical centers, and 30% have
received independent fellowship grants, K awards, and/or R01 grants. The proposed Neurosurgery and
Neurology Research Education Program leverages our past educational experiences and the strong
neuroscience community at WUSM in order to develop an enhanced and distinct research training pipeline,
specifically for neurosurgeons and neurologists interested in academic careers as independent researchers, with
the overall long-term goal of ensuring that highly-trained physician-scientists will be available to make future
advances to reduce the burden of neurological diseases."

Although survival rates for infants born extremely preterm (< 28 weeks’ gestation) have improved dramatically in
recent decades, cognitive impairment remains a major concern. Adequate cognition is foundational for high
quality of life and well-being. Compared to those born full term, extremely preterm children exhibit much higher
rates of cognitive function impairment from early childhood through adulthood; and this is associated with
neonatal inflammation. However, longitudinal research on cognitive function among extremely preterm children
is limited. Little is known about how genetic and epigenetic factors are associated with trajectories of cognitive
function, which can show longitudinal patterns such as downward/impaired, low-stable or upward-improvement.
This raises a key unanswered question: are there genetic-epigenetic links to neonatal inflammation that
predispose extremely preterm children to a particular trajectory of cognitive function? To address this question,
we propose these specific aims: 1) Identify perinatal and neonatal immune factors predicting trajectories of
cognitive function from ages 2 - 17 years among extremely preterm children; 2) Determine genetic variants and
gene-by-neonatal inflammation mediation that predict trajectories of cognitive function; and 3) Examine whether
DNA methylation modifies the effects of genetic variants and neonatal inflammation on trajectories of cognitive
function. Our central hypothesis is that genetic variants of immune-related genes interact with neonatal immune
factors to increase risk for a low-stable trajectory of cognitive function during childhood and adolescence.
Additionally, we hypothesize that DNA methylation can mediate the effects of genetic variants to protect against
the low-stable trajectory. These hypotheses are based on several preliminary findings from our team
demonstrating that neonatal inflammation, as well as genetic and epigenetic factors regulating immune
response, can influence cognitive function. This proposal leverages the Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborn
(ELGAN) study, a multi-center cohort of extremely preterm children currently followed to age 15 years (N = 810),
containing vast data on neurodevelopment and a unique biospecimen repository. Although ELGAN has DNA
methylation data from placentas on a subset of the sample, we propose to use banked umbilical cord specimens
for whole-genome genotyping and neonatal blood specimens for DNA methylation of the entire cohort. This
proposal aligns with the scheduled ELGAN follow-up at 17 years of age to collect cognitive function data. This
proposal has potential for significant impact on science and clinical practice related to cognitive function among
extremely preterm children and is among the first to study relationships among genetic, epigenetic, immune
factor and developmental trajectories of cognitive function. From this work, we can identify genes and
mechanisms that can be used for risk stratification, as well as molecular processes that can be the targets of
early risk-mitigating interventions to improve quality of life for children born extremely preterm. This information
allows for targeted surveillance, preventative therapies and early intervention as soon after birth as possible."

Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) is characterized by disordered neural network activity and temporal lobe seizures.
As many as 3 million individuals with TLE in the United States also experience cognitive and sleep problems,
resulting in poor school performance in childhood, with high risk of underemployment in adulthood, and
consequent lower socioeconomic status. Individuals with TLE frequently experience sleep fragmentation, which
disrupts memory consolidation and sustained attention, both of which are impaired in this disorder. While these
comorbidities can be long-term consequences of repeated seizures and medications, it is now known that they
also often present prior to the first recognized seizure and worsen over time even with successful seizure
treatment. This suggests that an early neural network abnormality may underlie seizure development while
simultaneously impairing sleep and cognitive development, even prior to the added effects of disorder chronicity.
In spite of this, there has been limited research addressing mechanisms underlying these sleep and cognitive
problems in TLE. This represents a critical unmet public health need and both the National Academy of
Medicine and NINDS have identified this notable gap as a research priority. I will begin to address this gap with
the my K23 proposal by investigating abnormal sleep architecture patterns in TLE that directly contribute to
cognitive deficits using both an observational (Aim 1) and a mechanistic interventional (Aim 2) approach. In
typical NREM sleep, electroencephalogram (EEG) slow wave oscillations are phase-locked and coupled with
sleep spindle oscillations (SW-SSO), which facilitates memory consolidation and potentially improves attention.
In TLE, disordered networks that result in interictal epileptic discharges and seizures may also contribute to
altered SW-SSO coupling during sleep, resulting in memory and attention deficits. A single night of acoustic
stimulation (AS) has been proven effective in enhancing SW-SSO coupling and improving cognitive performance
in healthy older adults but has not been studied in TLE. My central hypothesis is that disordered networks in
newly diagnosed TLE patients result in altered sleep architecture, which disrupt memory consolidation and
attention capability. I will test this hypothesis by: (1) characterizing TLE sleep architecture using computational
EEG – sleep spindle density, slow wave power, interictal epileptiform discharges, and SW-SSO coupling (Aim
1a), (2) linking these specific TLE-related sleep architecture patterns to cognitive processing (Aim 1b); (3)
determining if AS enhances SW-SSO coupling in young adults with TLE (Aim 2a) and (4) determining if enhanced
SW-SSO coupling improves memory and attention in TLE (Aim 2b). This training award will provide me the
opportunity to extend my research expertise into computational sleep EEG acquisition and analysis, acoustic
stimulation techniques, and clinical trial design. My long-term goal is to leverage connections between sleep,
behavior and neural network activity to develop and implement tailored cognitive and sleep interventions for
individuals with epilepsy."

Understanding the metabolic characteristics of tumors and their environments is crucial for elucidating the
mechanisms of cancer development and for developing therapeutic strategies. Despite the increasing availability
of 3D gene expression and other high-throughput data, a major unresolved challenge is how to translate complex
datasets and knowledge of human metabolism and cellular biophysics into forecasts of tumor growth dynamics,
spatial structure and severity, and possible therapeutic strategies. Our highly interdisciplinary project will
leverage existing computational approaches to address this challenge, establishing a new avenue for performing
spatio-temporal modeling and simulations of whole-cell cancer metabolism in its microenvironment. Previous
work has explored 3D mathematical models of cancer growth based on simplified descriptions of cell populations,
e.g. through differential equations. In parallel, based on the approach of flux balance analysis, detailed tumor
metabolism models have been used to predict all steady state fluxes in the cell, and the effects of perturbations
of target genes. While in principle possible, models combining 3D spatio-temporal dynamics with detailed
genome-scale metabolism, have not been developed yet. Here, we propose to repurpose our free and open-
access software platform for computation of microbial ecosystems in time and space (COMETS) towards the
study of tumor growth dynamics. Specifically: Aim 1: We will generate omics-data-constrained genome scale
models of specific cancer cell lines, and import them into COMETS. We will then simulate overall tumor growth
dynamics, and test our capacity to accurately predict key metabolic phenotypes, such as growth curves, glucose
and amino acid uptake, and lactate secretion. Aim 2: We will build upon our capacity to accurately simulate with
COMETS fine details of multicellular dynamics in 2D to generate and test predictions of tumor growth on a
surface. We will vary tumor geometry and microenvironment composition, and experimentally test predictions
using a cancer on-chip approach. Aim 3: Using the advanced capabilities of COMETS, we will explore tumor
heterogeneity, and extend our detailed biophysical model for biomass propagation to 3D realistic
microenvironments (with gradients and vascularization), in search for metabolic characteristics associated with
morphological features of 3D tumors. We expect that results generated through this project will pave the way for
predictive modeling of cancer growth and metabolism, applicable to the study of in vivo tumors. Gradual
application of new COMETS capabilities will allow us to extend initial models to more complex scenarios and
configurations, including interactions between different cell types, detailed modeling of specific tumor geometries
based on imaging data, predictions of metastasis and metabolic adaptation in tissues other than the tissue of
origin, simulations of interactions with the microbiome, and the implementation of in silico testing of thousands
of combinatorial therapeutic strategies."

The brain makes up 2% of the body’s weight but uses 20% of the body’s energy that is observed from the
delivery of blood through the dense network of the neurovasculature. Neurovascular function is critical for
optimal brain function and altered neurovascular function contributes or brain pathology. Microglia ate brain-
resident immune cells that respond to brain injuries and disease but their interactions with the vasculature has
been poorly explored. In my preliminary data, I extensively characterized microglial interactions with the
neurovasculature in the healthy brain. Specifically, I have found that about a third of the microglia population
physically interact with the neurovasculature through their cell bodies which are more stationary than their
processes. Interestingly, a deficiency of Trem2, a microglial-specific risk gene for AD, results in a significant
increase in microglial-vascular interactions. Finally, pharmacological elimination of CSF1R-expressing cells
such as microglia resulted in increased vascular size and cerebral blood flow suggesting modulatory roles for
microglia on the vasculature. In this project, I will further investigate this by (i) determining specific roles for
microglia in regulating vascular structure and function; (ii) determining the requirement for astrocytic endfeet
calcium signaling in mediating microglial-dependent vascular structure and functional regulation, and (iii)
determine TREM2 roles in microglial-vascular interactions including vascular amyloid deposition in AD. These
studies will provide insights into the cellular, molecular and mechanistic basis of microglial regulation of
neurovascular structure and function."

There are bidirectional neurobiological links between anxiety and epilepsy. However, the specific processes
linking these conditions remain unclear. Stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) is a critical tool for localizing
the ictal onset zone in patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy (TRE) undergoing evaluation for resective
surgery and provide an ideal approach to study the disruptions in the distributed networks that underlie this
link. Further, investigation of these circuits and their causal impact on human behavior and cognition is
possible through the delivery of electrical stimuli via the already implanted sEEG electrodes. The proposed
work will assess anxiety-related disruptions in emotion regulation neurocircuitry using sEEG and test how
stimulation to dorsomedial prefrontal cortex modulates the underlying networks in TRE. Completion of the
proposed work will provide a causal understanding of the link between fronto-limbic network functions, anxiety,
and epilepsy. The knowledge gained from this study will be applied to the field of mental health research to
identify critical network nodes related to anxiety and demonstrate that this circuit can be modulated by
electrical stimulation. The central hypothesis is that TRE is associated with disruption in the function of the
fronto-limbic network (i.e., prefrontal cortex; amygdala), and in turn, this dysfunction disrupts healthy emotion
regulation resulting in anxiety symptoms (Aim 1). Further, stimulation of dorsomedial prefrontal regions will
directly influence anticipatory regulation of amygdala responses to threat (Aim 2).
These aims will be accomplished in the context of a formal research plan, supported by a team of researchers
with relevant expertise. Additionally, the data generated during the R21 effort will gather the preliminary data
required for a competitive R01 randomized clinical trial application. The University of Alabama at Birmingham
offers state-of-the-art research expertise and resources that will also serve to prepare this proposal for
success. Specifically, the proposed work will utilize advanced sEEG recording and stimulation techniques,
including functional connectivity and behavioral measures of emotion processes, one of the nation’s top
epilepsy research and treatment centers, and a dynamic network of clinical research expertise, cores, and
laboratories."
10846659,"Matrix turnover in bone occurs through bone remodeling and is essential to maintaining bone homeostasis and
health. Osteocytes, which are cells embedded in the bone matrix, regulate bone remodeling both directly by
controlling the activity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts and indirectly through perilacunar/canalicular remodeling
(PLR). The ability of osteocytes to regulate osteoblast and osteoclast activity in bone remodeling and
homeostasis is well known, but many questions remain about the direct role of osteocyte in remodeling via
PLR in bone homeostasis or disease states. In PLR, osteocytes directly resorb and deposit bone matrix
surrounding their lacuno-canalicular network (LCN). Indeed, osteocyte-intrinsic deletion of TGFβ signaling in
TβRIIocy−/− mice causes defective PLR and bone quality. Furthermore, preliminary data from RNAseq of
TβRIIocy−/− bone shows significant mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of
how TGFβ regulates mitochondrial function and PLR in osteocytes is currently poorly understood.
One of the most well-known molecular regulators of mitochondrial function and metabolism in other cell/tissue
types is microRNAs (miRs). miRs are endogenous, small non-coding RNAs that facilitate sequence-dependent
post-transcriptional gene regulation and coordinately target gene networks of complex biological processes,
such as cellular metabolism. However, the role of miRs in mediating osteocyte mitochondrial function has not
been explored.
This project will test the hypothesis that osteocytic TGFβ signaling regulates mitochondrial function via
a miRNA-dependent mechanism to control osteocyte function by focusing on a microRNA cluster, miR-181a/b. Aim 1 will determine the requirement of miR-181a/b for osteocyte function. Aim 2 will determine the
extent to which miR-181a/b regulate mitochondrial function in osteocytes. Aim 3 will determine whether the
regulation of mitochondrial function by TGFβ is miR-181a/b-dependent. This study will aid our understanding of
mechanisms responsible for maintaining homeostatic PLR and potentially aid in the development of new,
innovative approaches to treat or prevent bone diseases, including in the craniofacial skeleton, due to bone
remodeling defects."

Crohn’s disease (CD) is characterized by progressive, transmural inflammation that can affect any region of the
gastrointestinal tract. Penetrating complications, most often perianal fistulae, will affect up to 50% of CD patients
over their disease course. Perianal fistulae are a high morbidity CD complication with poor treatment response.
African ancestry (AA) patients have higher rates of perianal disease, including perianal fistula, than European
ancestry (EA) CD patients. Many of the genetic advances of the genome wide association era are from studies
wherein AA patients are underrepresented. PTGER4 is the only risk locus with strong association signals in AA
populations. There is a need to include AA patients in genetic and genomic studies of CD, particularly in the
context of perianal fistula, to better understand drivers of disease and improve clinical outcomes.
Aim 1 seeks to construct a single cell genomics cohort of AA and EA patients with a history of perianal fistulizing
CD. To date, there is no single cell sequencing dataset of CD samples with a focus on the rectum or fistula, nor
a dataset comparing single cell gene expression between these ancestry groups in CD. We will perform CITE-
sequencing on resection tissues from proctectomies and colectomies in patients with severe CD and history of
perianal fistula. We will also collect rectal biopsies from areas of active inflammation and from un-involved rectum
or colon for single cell RNA sequencing. From these data, we will identify differential gene expression modules
that will be validated by projection onto available bulk RNA sequencing data from larger CD patient cohorts.
Single cell capture of both RNA and protein expression will provide unprecedented granularity into cell
populations important in fistula progression and illuminate any differences between patient populations.
In Aim 2, we will further explore drivers of fistula pathogenesis. We identify IL-17 and PGE2 signaling as
candidate pathways that influence epithelial integrity in the context of inflammation and epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT), promoting fistula inception. We will culture epithelial monolayers long-term from patient-derived
organoids to model epithelial differentiation, barrier function, and EMT. We will use this system to assess the
effects of PGE2 and IL-17 receptor agonism and inhibition on epithelial cells, and how this may influence wound
healing and mediate fistula inception. In this way, we will be able to interrogate specific signaling pathways and
their contributions to epithelial health using functional readouts.
The academic environment at Mount Sinai is unparalleled to perform this work. Mount Sinai is home to pioneers
in IBD clinical care and research, who collaborate in meaningful ways while working with one of the most diverse
patient populations in the world. The training plan for this fellowship takes full advantage. Together, the studies
described herein will provide important insight into perianal fistula inception and which gene modules might make
a patient susceptible. This proposal combines direct ex vivo single cell genomics with in vitro functional studies
for a robust inquiry into a high morbidity complication that affects diverse patient populations."

In response to an emerging need for scientists who can bring innovative skills and perspectives to problems in
the hearing sciences, we continue to build upon our well established Training Program in Comparative and
Evolutionary Biology of Hearing at the University of Maryland, College Park. The 17 Core Faculty in our group
bring an extraordinarily broad range of expertise, from cellular and molecular biology to systems neuroscience,
while also demonstrating a successful track record in training students. These capabilities allow us to offer a
training program that not only emphasizes a comparative and evolutionary perspective to understanding the
auditory system, but also does so across different levels of analysis. We propose new approaches to train the
next generation of scientists to translate knowledge and methodologies across biomedical sciences, enabling
breakthroughs that cannot be achieved through work confined to a single discipline and using a single model
system. The next cycle of our training program promotes a focus on translational research, in which we will
continue to expand our trainees' appreciation of the biomedical applications of basic research to solving
problems concerned with hearing across the human life span, including prevention, diagnosis, and genetics of
hearing impairment and relevant therapeutic interventions. Core Faculty are from four departments and one
program at UMD (Biology, Psychology, Hearing and Speech Sciences, Electrical and Computer Engineering,
and Neuroscience and Cognitive Science) and one program at the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB:
Graduate Program in Life Sciences). Additional associated faculty from other UMD programs, NIDCD, and
other regional institutions, such as UMB and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, work closely with
the Core Faculty and provide further research and training opportunities for pre- and post-doctoral trainees.
The Training Program requests support for five predoctoral and two postdoctoral trainees. Predoctoral trainees
are generally selected in middle to later training years, when they are primarily engaged in research. In
addition to research training, all trainees take courses in the fundamentals of hearing and research ethics,
attend seminars/courses in professional development and translational auditory science, as well as participate
in all program activities. Emphasis throughout the program is to expose trainees to the breadth of work done in
the program’s participating labs, and through this exposure, gain a better appreciation for the range of
questions being asked and interdisciplinary research methods applied today in the hearing sciences."

The purpose of the Dietary Biomarker Development Centers (DBDCs) Consortium is to identify
biomarkers of dietary intake that can serve as independent markers of dietary intake and
complement current dietary intake assessment methods and the continually evolving evidence
base for addressing metabolic transformation of dietary constituents, especially the non-
nutrients by host and microbial metabolism. The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) aims to: 1)
provide a robust administrative management structure that enhances communication and
collaboration and improves the DBDC’s Consortium productivity and quality, 2) provide data
transfers, harmonization, integration, processing, and management, 3) develop a self-service
analytics platform and interactive reporting for users and conduct analyses, and 4) communicate
and disseminate knowledge within and beyond the Consortium. Operationally, the DCC will
develop manuals of operations, provide protocol training, establish and monitor timelines,
organize meetings with the Steering Committee (SC), NIDDK/USDA, and Data Safety and
Monitoring Board (DSMB). For data management, the DCC will establish a federally-compliant
online electronic data capture system to support the direct submission of data and a web-based
consortium communication and collaboration platform (CCCP) for secure data sharing and
dissemination of tools and results. The CCCP will have a link to access the self-service
analytics and interactive reporting to facilitate easy access to the data. The DCC will periodically
assess data quality, perform checks for data completeness, develop data documentation,
ensure protection of patient confidentiality, prepare reports for the SC and DSMB, and prepare
de-identified public use data files for submission into the NIDDK repository. Finally, the DCC will
provide thought leadership, biostatistical support, and methodological innovation to account for
the multi-faceted nature of dietary biomarker development, and facilitate the preparation and
dissemination of study results through multiple high-impact manuscripts and presentations. Our
team’s nationally recognized expertise in data management, harmonization, and coordination of
large networks, and our experience in biomarker research uniquely positions the DCRI to
provide all of the services and support required by the Consortium."
10870220,"Low back pain (LBP) is a key source of medical costs and disability, impacting over 31 million Americans at
any given time and resulting in $100-$200 billion per year in total healthcare costs. LBP is one of the leading
causes of ambulatory care visits to US physicians; unfortunately, these visits often result in treatments such as
opioids that can lead to more harm than benefit. In 2017 the American College of Physicians (ACP) guideline
for LBP recommended patients receive non-pharmacological interventions as a first-line treatment but stopped
short of offering solutions regarding how such treatments should be integrated into routine patient care.
Roadmaps exist for multi-disciplinary collaborative care that includes doctors of chiropractic and physical
therapists, well-trained primary contact clinicians with specific expertise in the treatment of musculoskeletal
conditions, as first line providers for LBP. These clinicians routinely employ many of the non-pharmacological
approaches recommended by the ACP guideline, including spinal manipulation and exercise. Important
foundational work conducted by members of the study team has demonstrated that such care is feasible, safe,
and results in improved physical function, less pain, fewer opioid prescriptions, and reduced utilization of
healthcare services. However, this treatment approach for LBP has yet to be widely implemented or validated
using rigorous scientific methods. Our overarching goal is to refine and implement a multidisciplinary
collaborative care model for LBP (MC2LBP) in 3 academic Health Care Systems (HCS) and then evaluate its
effectiveness by comparing it to usual medical care in patients age 18 and older suffering from LBP.
Completion of project study aims will begin with a one-year UG3 planning phase involving completion of 22
milestones in 2 categories of phased activities - model implementation and clinical trial design. UH3 study aims
will be accomplished using a pragmatic, cluster-randomized, clinical trial design. The study will be managed
through a Clinical Coordinating Center and Data Coordinating Center, both housed at the Duke Clinical
Research Institute, in collaboration with Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and the University of Iowa.
During the planning phase, we will build implementation infrastructure across three HCS, finalize the clinical
trial protocol, and complete the tasks necessary to transition from the UG3 to UH3 phase. The UH3 phase will
be used to: 1) Operationalize the integration of new organizational policies and procedures required to facilitate
implementation of MC2LBP at intervention clinics; 2) Determine the comparative effectiveness of MC2LBP vs
usual care; 3) Estimate and compare medical resource use and costs of implementing MC2LBP; and 4)
Evaluate patient, provider, system and policy level barriers and facilitators to implementing MC2LBP, using a
mixed method, process evaluation approach. Results from this study have the potential to inform future
implementation and policy efforts to improve the quality of pain management for patients suffering from LBP
while simultaneously reducing opioid prescriptions, health care costs and utilization of services."

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is the preferred approach for the treatment of
patients with malignant diseases of the bone marrow (BM) and congenital BM failure syndromes. The efficacy
of allo-HSCT is dependent on the anti-tumor activity of the conditioning therapy and the donor graft. The
efficacy of allo-HSCT is dependent on the ability of donor bone marrow/stem cells to replace the host immune
system. However, it is clear that not all immune cells are generated from adult bone marrow cells. B1b
lymphocytes and Langerhans cells are generated from fetal cells and not reconstituted by donor bone marrow.
Additionally, our group and others have shown that innate lymphoid cells (ILC), which generate cytokines
similar to T lymphocytes but don’t express germ-line encoded receptors, are not completely reconstituted after
stem cell transplantation.
The mechanism for the absence of ILC2 cells in the GI tract post allo-HSCT is not clear as these cells routinely
are found in the bloodstream of patients and are reconstituted after autologous stem cell transplantation. Our
group has found in mice that fetal liver derived ILC2 precursor cells can reconstitute the GI tract indicating that
the niche can support ILC2 cells. This has led us to hypothesize that the inflammatory response found after
allo-HSCT from the GvH response limits the development of ILC2 cells.
ILC2 cells have significant plasticity, mediated by epigenetic changes in critical lineage-specific loci that leads
to the development of ex-ILC2 cells, which are functionally similar to ILC1 or ILC3 cells. Our group has found
that ILC1 cells, which generate IFN-γ, exacerbate GI tract GvHD. Furthermore, the pro-inflammatory cytokines,
IL-12 and IL-1β, which are increased post allo-HSCT especially in the presence of the GvH response, convert
ILC2 to ILC1 cells. Our group has found in ILC2 cells that H3K9me1/2 marks, which maintain gene
transcription of gata3, cmaf and rora, critical for ILC2 maintenance and function, are enhanced by inhibiting
lysine specific demethylases. The first specific aim focuses on enhancing the function of ILC2 cells in vivo to
treat GvHD by inhibiting Jumonji containing and lysine-specific demethylases.
Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is a significant complication of allo-HSCT. T cells that generate IL-
17A, Th17 cells, are critical to the pathogenesis of BOS. One risk factor for BOS is an antecedent viral
infection of the lung, although the mechanism for this is not clear. Quite recently our group has found that viral
infection in the lung converts lung ILC2 cells to ILC3-like cells that generate IL-23 critical for the expansion of
Th17 cells. The second specific aim of this proposal focuses on the use of demethylases given with ILC2 cells
to prevent and/or treat post-viral BOS.
Completion of the goals of this project will greatly enhance our understanding of the mechanisms important for
the loss of ILC2 cells post-transplant, and provide new approaches to utilize ILCs to treat GvHD."
10885093,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathies (DEE) are individually rare but collectively substantial
neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by debilitating seizures and unremitting neurological comorbidities.
Dedicated exome sequencing efforts have led to unprecedented success in DEE gene discovery, with one-third
or more cases that are brought to the genetics clinic resulting in a clear genetic diagnosis. This new insight has,
in turn, created high expectations for precision or personalized medicine to deliver new therapies to families who
otherwise do not have many options for disease mitigation, since conventional drug therapy is ineffective for
most symptoms in any given DEE. In principle, gene therapy offers potential for treating any symptom caused
by a defective gene because it is based on replacing or eliminating it in situ. Among the barriers to clinical
application include the mode and the timing of delivery, particularly for neurodevelopmental disease, and the
concern about side effects from unintended impact on gene expression in cell types that do not require attention.
The purpose and the design of this renewal proposal is to address these barriers directly using ready manipulable
mouse models to examine key issues in the development and progression of DEE and the prospects for gene
therapy. First, we will apply new methods explicitly designed to detect epileptiform activity and developmental
milestones in mouse pups, representing an understudied but most appropriate age to model a childhood disease.
We will then use mouse genetics tools to drive gene expression in different neuron types or developmental ages
in these models, in order to determine the cellular etiology and critical window for disease development. Last,
we will extend RNA-based gene therapy efforts to these models, testing for both effective mitigation of pathogenic
features while monitoring accompanying changes in global gene expression. To accomplish these goals we have
assembled a team of four laboratories each contributing complementary expertise. Through this synergistic,
collaborative effort, we expect to make significant strides in understanding the basis of disease in three striking
models of DEE with the potential to advance new treatments in the clinic."

Humans are inherently social creatures, wherein social connection (SC) is essential for optimizing well-being
(WB),1–3 including positive feelings, perceptions, and functioning in daily life and the absence of psychological
problems and pathological distress.4,5 This is especially critical during adolescence, a sensitive developmental
period with substantial and rapid changes in their general social connections (and in peer and family domains in
particular).6 Social isolation (i.e. lacking SC) is one of the primary risk factors for adolescent mental and physical
health problems,7–9 while having sufficient SC is a strong facilitative factor for their long-term WB and civic
engagement in adulthood.7,10,11 SC is a multi-faceted construct that includes the facets of quality of, quantity of,
and need for social interactions,2,12–14 each demonstrating unique influences on adolescent health and WB.14–21
However, little is known about how these facets converge and predict (or are predicted by) adolescent WB over
time or the extent by which neurobiological markers of SC relate to WB.22–24 The overall objective of the project
is to evaluate the integrative facets of SC quality, quantity, and need, and their reciprocal associations
with adolescent WB, in daily fluctuations, long-term trajectories, and neurobiological processes.
Proposed project scientific goals are to: (1) Evaluate short-term reciprocal process between SC and WB; (2)
Examine the long-term reciprocity between SC constellations and WB trajectories; and (3) Identify the
convergence of behavioral and neurobiological markers of SC and their prospective associations with WB.
Exploratory analyses will (a) explore modulation of these processes by sex, gender, age, pubertal status, and
race and (b) consider the above three goals in peer- and family- specific SC contexts. Study design: The first
two goals will be addressed via an online platform to ensure a large sample of 12-17-year-old adolescents using
a 14-day daily diary design nested within a longitudinal study design (N=914 enrolled; T1-T2-T3, every 0.5 year).
A subset of participants (n=104 enrolled) will also complete an in-person battery (at T1 and T3) of SC
experimental tasks targeting each of the three SC facets during electroencephalography (EEG) and eye tracking
(ET) acquisition. To evaluate the short-term reciprocal process, we will use daily questionnaire assessments of
SC and WB to examine the same-day and next-day associations between SC and WB (Aim 1). To provide a
holistic consideration of the three SC facets, we will identify adolescent subgroups based upon their experience
of SC quality, quantity, and need (at T1, T3, respectively) and WB trajectories (T1-T2-T3), and examine the
prospective transition probabilities between SC constellations and WB trajectories (Aim 2). Lastly, we will assess
the convergence of behavioral and neurobiological markers of SC (at T1 and T3) and their prospective
associations with WB (Aim 3). Significance: A deeper understanding of the reciprocal relationship between SC
and WB and the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these associations will be crucial for mechanism-
informed prevention programming."

Relapsing fever (RF) spirochetes are a group of neglected vector-borne pathogens that are a significant cause
of child morbidity and mortality. The current approaches to grow and assess tick transmission of RF spirochetes
are impractical in resource limited settings where they are prevalent. For example, propagating spirochetes in
culture medium is expensive and labor intensive. Moreover, prolonged in vitro propagation in medium causes
DNA rearrangements of their already exceedingly complex genomes, and this results in diminished vector
colonization and pathogenesis. There is a critical need for cost effective practical approaches to grow and study
RF spirochetes from neglected regions of the globe. This project builds on our prior our publication reporting the
first isolation of Borrelia caucasica, which is part of the Persica species complex and is distributed through
Eurasia and the Middle East. Moreover, our recent advances RF spirochete genomics addressed a major
limitation in the field and resulted in complete chromosome and plasmid assembled and annotated genomes.
The genomics tools we developed can now be utilized to characterize a model for the Persica complex species.
Interestingly, historical literature suggested that embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs) could be infected with RF
spirochetes by tick bite and the bacteria grew in this system. However, at the time molecular and genomics
resources were not available to characterize this model and knowledge gaps remain about the pathogens
genomic stability in ECEs. Leveraging recent advances in RF spirochete genomics, the ECE model can now be
fully developed to study Persica complex species. In this study, two aims are proposed. The first aim is to utilize
genomics resources for RF spirochetes and evaluate plasmid diversity and identify unique plasmid markers of
B. caucasica isolates through a comparative genomic analysis. The first objective is to complete reference quality
genomes assemblies of B. caucasica isolates and perform a comparative genomics analysis to identify plasmid
markers. The second objective is to develop a panel of specific probes needed to evaluate plasmid retention and
rearrangements during the B. caucasica life cycle. In the second aim, we will assess genomic changes of B.
caucasica using the tick – ECE model. The first objective is to develop the B. caucasica model in ECEs and
evaluate spirochete growth, tick acquisition, and subsequent tick transmission of spirochetes to naïve eggs. The
second objective is to assess plasmid stability and the ability of B. caucasica to remain infectious after passage
through ECEs. The establishment of the ECE model will result in a cost-effective approach to amplify RF
spirochetes in the absence of culture medium. Moreover, the development of this model offers a practical system
to study the transmission cycle and vector competence of RF spirochetes in resource limited settings. With the
emergence and health burden of RF spirochetes in low-income countries, it is important to develop systems to
propagate and study these neglected pathogens."

Despite the advances made in our understanding of the etiology of pediatric soft tissue sarcomas
(STS), the overall survival of those diseases has not significantly improved in over 2 decades. For
children with recurrent disease, survival is below 30%, and long-term survivors have an increased
burden of disease associated with the curative therapies they received. Therefore, the goal of our
research team is to improve the survival and quality of life of children with STS by integrating basic,
translational, and clinical research. For the past 10 years, we have consented STS and other solid
tumor patients to donate tissue for orthotopic implantation into immunocompromised mice to develop
orthotopic patient derived xenografts (O-PDXs). Our O-PDXs have been used for ex vivo high-
throughput drug screening and in vivo testing using a standardized preclinical phase I, II, III paradigm.
Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common STS in children and genomic studies have shown that
rare subsets of clonally related cells can survive treatment and contribute to disease recurrence.
Subsequent integrated analyses using transcriptomic, epigenetic and proteomic data showed that RMS
tumors retain lineage-specific transcriptional and epigenetic signatures of their developmental origins.
More recently, single cell and single nucleus RNA-seq (sc/snRNA-seq) and in vivo lineage-tracing
showed that clones of cells can transition through their normal developmental programs. Indeed, single-
cell ATAC-seq demonstrated that the cell- and developmental stage–specific super-enhancer activity is
correlated with those clonal changes in gene expression. Chemotherapy eliminates the most
proliferative tumor cell populations, and the surviving dormant tumor cells rapidly expand and re-
establish their developmental hierarchy, which leads to disease recurrence. This is a striking example
of the complex cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic signaling within STS and the intricate connection between
developmental and oncogenic pathways in childhood cancer. In this proposal, we will perform in vivo
testing for 8-10 drugs per year using our STS O-PDX models. The most compelling pathways are
developmental kinase pathways (Aim 1), cell stress pathways (Aim 2) and G2/M cell cycle checkpoints
(Aim 3). Novel drug combinations will be tested as well as those that include conventional
chemotherapy for standard of care. Particular emphasis will be placed on eliminating all the clones in
the tumor to improve survival by reducing disease recurrence."

 Children with disseminated neuroblastoma have a very high risk of treatment failure and death despite
receiving intensified chemotherapy, radiation therapy and immunotherapy. The long-term goal of the Mossé
and Maris translational research programs is to substantively improve neuroblastoma cure rates by developing
patient-specific therapies that target the unique oncogenic drivers of each case. Within the context of the
National Cancer Institute’s Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program (Ped-In Vivo-TP) we propose a Neuroblastoma
Research Program built on richly annotated and highly characterized patient derived xenograft (PDX) and
other recently developed murine models of this disease. The central hypothesis to be tested in this Program is
that neuroblastoma-specific oncogenic drivers and optimal immunotherapeutic targets can be defined and
exploited through rationally designed therapies based on validated and clinically measurable biomarkers.
Through our dedicated focus on neuroblastoma and our central role in the former Pediatric Preclinical Testing
Program and Consortium, we have developed an investigative team and rich set of resources and reagents to
be uniquely positioned to achieve the goals of the Ped-In Vivo-TP. Here we propose to use a large (and
growing) collection of PDX models that have been fully characterized with the most modern genomic
technologies to address the challenge of prioritizing the large armamentarium of anti-cancer agents in
development so that early phase biomarker-driven clinical trials can be designed with the objective of showing
potent and specific anti-tumor activity. We propose three specific aims directed towards 1) developing and
characterizing highly annotated models of human neuroblastoma; 2) performing preclinical trials with drugs
directed against defined therapeutic vulnerabilities in order to prioritize agents for the clinic, and 3) developing
the portfolio of preclinical data required for design of clinical trials with robust biomarkers for patient selection
and monitoring. In collaboration with other preclinical testing programs, we will seek to determine if discoveries
in our program are relevant to other childhood cancers and collaborate across disease groups on clinical
development strategies. Thus, this Program will seek to shift the paradigm for how high-risk neuroblastoma
patients are treated with the goal of substantively improving the outcomes, both in terms of cure rates, but also
by decreasing the toxicity associated with current standards of care."

Many authorities recommend the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) for the prevention of cardiometabolic disease.
These dietary recommendations are based on population averages and may not be best suited for a given
individual. Preliminary data from our group and others support that a specific dietary intervention may have highly
variable effects in different individuals due to the individual composition of the gut microbiome. Furthermore, we
recently reported that autologous fecal microbiota transplantation (aFMT) derived from the time of maximal
weight reduction enhanced the effects of MedDiet on maintaining cardiometabolic health in an RCT. This
background supports our central hypothesis that the gut microbiome can modify the effects of MedDiet on
cardiometabolic disease risk. However, no studies have utilized longitudinally collected data from RCTs to test
this hypothesis. Most diet-microbiome studies are limited by the use of 16S rRNA gene sequencing yielding only
very general taxonomic profiling, thus omitting strain-specific diet-related biochemical functions of microbes. To
gain more advanced mechanistic insights, combining shotgun metagenomics and metatranscriptomics and
metabolomics in an integrated framework presents a unique opportunity to probe both the composition and
functionality of gut microbial communities. This proposed project will leverage two long-term dietary RCTs, the
recently completed 18-month DIRECT-PLUS trial of 294 participants and the ongoing 3-year MIND trial of 604
participants, to examine whether individual gut microbial features modify the effects of MedDiet interventions on
cardiometabolic risk and body adiposity (Aim 1) and identify metabolites in feces and metabolites in plasma of
gut microbial origin that explain inter-individual differences in post-intervention changes in cardiometabolic risk
and adiposity (Aim 2) in the DIRECT-PLUS trial. Findings from Aims 1 and 2 will be tested for replication in the
MIND trial. In Aim 3, we will investigate long-lasting, post-intervention effects of combined MedDiet and aFMT,
and characterize gut microbial changes during and after the interventions in an RCT of 90 participants. Our
proposal addresses a major research priority, precision nutrition, emphasized in the 2020–2030 Strategic Plan
for NIH Nutrition Research and is directly responsive to PAR-19-377: “Omics-guided Biobehavioral Interventions
for Improved Health Outcomes: A Step Forward in Translation” as one of the first efforts to prospectively assess
the functional role of gut microbiome in explaining inter-individual heterogeneity in response to dietary
interventions. Built on existing biospecimen and data collected in two well-conducted long-term RCTs and state-
of-the-art multi'omics technologies, our proposal is a highly cost-efficient opportunity to generate translatable,
personalized dietary interventions grounded in reproducible biological mechanisms and contribute to the
paradigm shift towards precision nutrition for improved cardiometabolic health."

Cardiotoxicity of cancer treatments can lead to severe heart failure in cancer survivors or discontinuation of
cancer treatments. Currently, it is challenging to evaluate who is at the risk of developing cardiotoxicity prior to
cancer treatments and prevent the adverse side effects. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have
shown that genetic predispositions are one of the key determinants of risk susceptibility to chemotherapy-
induced cardiotoxicity. Consistently, the susceptibility to anti-cancer agents can be recapitulated by patient-
specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs), which reflect the donor
patients’ genetic makeup. The goal of this project is to identify genes and genetic variants that affect the
susceptibility to anti-cancer agents for developing cardio-protective therapies and risk assessment systems.
Although this proposal focuses on doxorubicin, which is one of the most commonly-used anti-cancer agents, the
approach described here is expandable to any other cancer treatment-induced cardiotoxicities such as those by
tyrosine kinase inhibitors and radiation therapy. First, I plan to identify genes whose inhibition or activation can
protect iPSC-CMs from doxorubicin using our iPSC-based CRISPR screening platform. The screened genes will
be causative in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC) and thus promising therapeutic targets. Second, I plan
to utilize bioengineering technologies and in vivo mouse models to assess the effects of candidate therapies
more accurately than simple monolayer culture systems. Since repurposing of approved drugs can accelerate
the clinical application of the findings, I plan to test existing drugs that target the validated genes in these models.
Finally, to develop a system to evaluate the genetic susceptibility to DIC, I plan to perform parallel
characterization of many genetic variants using iPSC-based base/prime-editing screens in DIC and generate
“susceptibility scores” of individual variants that are clinically implicated in DIC. The result will help with risk
stratification of patients who receive chemotherapies."

Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) are an aggressive form of cancer that is difficult to treat
due to the complexity and heterogeneity of the tumors. Resistance to drug and radiotherapy resulting in disease
recurrence is common as HNSCCs are genetically very heterogeneous among patients. Studies of the HNSCC
genome, transcriptome, and metabolome have revealed new altered targets, but translating these findings to
clinical improvements in treating patients is a long road ahead. Therefore, there is a critical need to innovate
strategies to facilitate precision in clinical decision-making. Recent studies by Gevaert Lab (Advisor) and Sunwoo
Lab (Co-mentor) have shown HNSCCs can be classified into various subtypes with distinct genetic and
epigenetic signatures. It is urgently important to know if these subtypes respond differently to the standard-of-
care treatments. This proposal will test if the drug and radiation response in patient-derived tumor organoids
(tumoroids) is correlated with DNA methylation patterns in these patients. Aim 1 will establish a high-throughput
automated HNSCC tumoroid platform by precise bioprinting tumoroids in 96- and 384-well plates to generate
self-assembled identical tumoroids, which will capture tumor heterogeneity of patients. Aim 2 will establish a
methodology to perform high-throughput tumoroid screening using 18-F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), a
radioisotope used for clinical imaging of cancer. The FDG influx rate inside tumoroids will be compared to the
standardized uptake values (SUV) of the patient tumors (from positron emission tomography (PET) scans) for
validation. Aim 3 will examine the standard-of-care and emerging treatment response among the five
heterogeneous HNSCC subgroups. I hypothesize that DNA (hypo/hyper) methylation plays a key role in HNSCC
treatment resistance to drugs and immunotherapy. This knowledge will significantly improve the future treatment
plans and overall survival rate of HNSCC patients. In addition, this project will have two significant innovations:
1) An automated high-throughput strategy to generate HNSCC tumoroids for drug, radiation and immunotherapy
screening. 2) A high-throughput screening strategy of tumoroids with gold-standard clinical imaging biomarkers,
which are used in clinic for accurate assessment of treatment response. These innovations will enable higher
clinical relevance, speed, and automation while reducing variability in both measurement and analysis in
organoid-based head and neck cancer research. My career development activities at Stanford University will
ensure gaining knowledge and expertise in head and neck cancer, bioprinting, strengthening scientific networks,
improving study design skills, and achieving scientific and professional independence. With the successful
completion of aims, a future prospective R01 grant will advance the technology further to make it more clinically
relevant and suitable for identifying new drug and immunotherapy targets of head and neck cancers. In summary,
the project will allow us to measure the sensitivity to standard-of-care treatments for HNSCC subtypes based on
their epigenetic footprints and pave a way to develop an effective and precision therapy for these patients."

There is increasing recognition that post-tuberculosis (TB) lung disease (PTLD) is common and causes
significant morbidity and mortality. However, changes in lung impairment are heterogenous with some patients
improving and others worsening after completion of TB treatment. Moreover, spirometry – the standard method
of assessing lung function – is not routinely available in high TB burden countries. Thus, to prioritize post-TB
patients who may benefit from early interventions, there is an urgent need to better facilitate early identification
of patients at risk for developing PTLD.
The overall objective of this application is to evaluate novel approaches to facilitate early identification of patients
most at risk for PTLD. The central hypothesis is that patient on-treatment (adherence behavior) and novel post-
treatment (cough frequency and acoustic features) factors will improve risk stratification of PTLD. The central
hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) characterize the evolution of lung function post-TB
and its impact on health-related quality of life, 2) evaluate cough frequency and acoustic features measured by
a novel mobile app as a non-invasive, inexpensive proxy for spirometry, and 3) evaluate adherence and cough
feature trajectories as novel predictors of PTLD. The results of this work will provide preliminary data for an NIH
R01 application evaluating app-based cough measurement as a monitoring tool for rarer but serious post-TB
outcomes including COPD, TB recurrence and mortality.
Dr. Huddart’s career goal is to become an independent investigator focused on understanding drivers of poor
outcomes among TB patients in order to inform interventions to avert TB-related morbidity and mortality. To
support her path to independence, the proposed work will be paired with a dedicated, multidisciplinary
mentorship team and training in patient-centered outcomes assessment (Aim 1), machine learning (Aim 2), and
dynamic outcome modelling (Aim 3). UCSF is an outstanding environment that is committed to junior
investigators with extensive resources for research and career development. Thus, the K01 award will provide
Dr. Huddart with the critical mentorship, training, resources and experience to become an international leader in
TB outcomes research."

G-protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest class of membrane signaling proteins, respond to a wide
array of extracellular stimuli to initiate intracellular signaling via G proteins and arrestins. Recent studies have
provided snapshots of GPCR structures in distinct conformations and revealed that they are extremely
dynamic. The conformational dynamics appear to be central to ligand recognition, activation and signaling.
Membrane receptors have evolved to respond to precise spatio-temporal concentration profiles of extracellular
ligands. In the nervous system, neurotransmitter receptors encounter a wide range of neurotransmitter
concentrations and spatio-temporal profiles. Key factors are the small extracellular volume of the synaptic cleft,
pumps and/or enzymes that remove neurotransmitter, and diffusion. Additionally, neurotransmitter receptors
can be localized within the synapse both pre- and postsynaptically, as well as extrasynaptically where they can
encounter neurotransmitter released either locally, which briefly reaches low millimolar levels within the cleft,
and spillover from nearby synapses, which reaches lower concentrations. Metabotropic glutamate receptors
(mGluRs) are found pre- and postsynaptically at excitatory glutamatergic synapses, as well as on glia and at
inhibitory GABAergic presynaptic nerve terminals, meaning that they are activated by both high local
concentrations near the site of release and spillover. mGluRs of various kinds can be found together in
presynaptic nerve terminals, even when they are all coupled to the same G protein. And they can dimerize,
generating hybrid or in some cases totally unique properties and pharmacological profiles. To understand what
each mGluR subtype does and develop effective drugs to treat the neurological disorders in which they are
implicated, we need to understand how they function and how they are regulated. Our goal here is to define
the molecular mechanisms that set and regulate the functional properties of homo- and heteromeric mGluRs at
synapses and put into place assays that can be used to screen modulation in the nervous system."
10903799,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over 25% of the US population reports exposure to early life adversity (ELA)—physical or emotional trauma or neglect in childhood. ELA predicts life-long health disparities, including increased risk for chronic cardiometabolic and autoimmune diseases and early mortality. Exposure to adversity in childhood is thought to program biological adaptations to stress that contribute to disease risk in adulthood. There are currently no evidence-based interventions to offset these risks in adulthood. Mindfulness meditation interventions have been effective for reducing stress and improving markers of physical health. However, it is unclear whether mindfulness interventions are acceptable and effective for improving health among people with a history of ELA. In a sample of emerging and young adults with a history of ELA, the proposed study evaluates feasibility of using smartphone-based mindfulness and control interventions and of measuring stress in daily life using ambulatory assessment and mobile sensor models with the long-term goal of implementing a stress-triggered just-in-time (JIT) mindfulness intervention in future research. Emerging/young adults with a history of ELA (n=80) will provide two weeks of baseline ambulatory stress ratings, continuous mobile sensor data (e.g., heart rate, activity, and location from wearable devices and smartphones), and blood samples to assess inflammatory biomarkers. Participants will then be randomly assigned to a 14-lesson smartphone-based (a) mindfulness training intervention or (b) matched coping control intervention, both boosted with randomly-delivered practice prompts to permit retrospective evaluation of JIT prompts. Ambulatory stress, sensor data, and inflammatory biomarkers will again be assessed at post-intervention and one-month follow-up. The following primary hypotheses will be tested: (1) interventions and assessments will be feasible in an ELA sample and (2) mindfulness training will improve daily life stress and inflammatory processes. Additionally, toward the design of a JIT mindfulness intervention, mobile sensor data will be used to develop machine-learning models predicting daily life stress, and practice prompts delivered at high stress moments will be evaluated for stress reduction benefit. To meet these aims, the candidate has assembled a mentorship team and training plan focused on (1) conceptual and methodological issues in ELA and health disparities, (2) advanced methods for assessing ambulatory and biological outcomes, and (3) new technology for optimizing outcome assessment and intervention delivery. Combined with the candidate’s background in mechanistic mindfulness research, the proposed research and training will launch an independent career dedicated to maximizing the efficacy of mindfulness interventions for addressing health disparities. These goals align with NCCIH’s objectives to advance understanding of complementary health interventions for improving health in at-risk populations using novel assessment technologies."

 The goal of this proposal is to demonstrate a novel non-degradative, non-cell autonomous, mechanism
by which the autophagy machinery regulates metabolism. Although emerging evidence suggests that autophagy
abnormality is implicated in metabolic dysfunction, the mechanism by which autophagy regulates insulin
sensitivity is largely unknown. Autophagy is generally considered as a destruction and degradation process via
lysosomes. We recently discovered a new non-degradative function regulated by a ULK1-Vps34-Becn1
autophagy machinery in adipose tissue, which may play a pivotal role in systemic AMPK activation and insulin
sensitization. Adiponectin is an adipose-derived hormone (adipokine), whose reduction in circulation is strongly
associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and metabolic syndrome. Hypoadiponectinemia caused by SNPs or
mutations in the Adiponectin gene in humans has been associated with insulin resistance and T2D, and
adiponectin knockout mice phenocopy the human phenotypes and develop insulin resistance. However, despite
the functional importance of adiponectin, the mechanism that regulates adiponectin secretion has received little
research attention and remains obscure. We found that autophagy-hyperactive mutant mice harboring an active
mutation in the essential autophagy protein Becn1 (Becn1F121A knock-in mice) have improved insulin sensitivity
in response to high-fat diet feeding, which is caused by factors in the circulation. To identify the Becn1-regulated,
insulin-sensitizing, circulating factors, we performed a hormonal screen and identified a higher level of
adiponectin in the serum of autophagy-hyperactive Becn1F121A mice. We found that on one hand, adipose-
specific Becn1F121A expression is sufficient to improve systemic insulin sensitivity and increase circulating
adiponectin levels; on the other hand, depleting Becn1, or inhibiting two upstream autophagy kinases, ULK1 and
Vps34, reduces circulating adiponectin in mice. Using proteomic and biochemical approaches, we discovered
that the exocyst component Sec6/Exoc3 is a binding partner of Becn1, and preferentially binds to the hyperactive
form, Becn1F121A. Motivated by the preliminary data, we propose our overall hypothesis that a ULK1-Vps34-
Becn1 autophagy axis improves insulin sensitivity by promoting adiponectin secretion via Becn1-exocyst binding
in adipocytes. We term this pathway as “autophagy-facilitated secretion”. To test the hypothesis, we propose the
following aims, using a combination of genetic, imaging, cell biology, biochemistry, and metabolic approaches:
Aim 1 is to determine whether active Becn1 activates AMPK and improves insulin sensitivity via adiponectin
signaling; Aim 2 is to determine whether a ULK1-Vps34-Becn1 autophagy axis functions in adipose tissue to
non-cell autonomously regulate systemic insulin sensitivity; and Aim 3 is to demonstrate the molecular
mechanism by which the Becn1-centered autophagy machinery regulates adiponectin secretion via the crosstalk
with the exocyst pathway. Overall, our study will establish a new mechanistic paradigm for the Becn1-centered
autophagy pathway in adipose tissue to prevent T2D, beyond its role in self-degradation."

The rate of suicide in nurses has reached alarming proportions, with recent estimates upward of 17.1 suicides
per 100,000 nurses each year—almost double that of the general population (8.6/100,000). Proposed is a
program of training and research using longitudinal design to investigate the associations among individual
(e.g., subjective mood, lifetime trauma) and work environment characteristics (e.g., shift type and duration); life
stressors (e.g., discrimination, lateral violence); and suicidal ideation or behavior in nurses. Whereas previous
research about suicide in nurses has been limited to postmortem data, cross-sectional studies or self-report
stress measures, the proposed project will collect longitudinal data and will use physiologic stress biomarkers
(hair cortisol) and epigenetics (DNA methylation) to better establish the temporal sequence of potential
nursing-specific risk factors (individual characteristics, life stressors, physiologic stress, and work environment
characteristics), and suicidal ideation or behavior in real-world clinical settings. Sleep will be tested as a
potential modifiable protective factor, as will nurse work environment characteristics (e.g., day vs. night shift).
Hair cortisol concentrations measure cumulative cortisol release and reflect past months of stress exposure,
thus avoiding diurnal variation effects and permitting the longitudinal investigation of real-world individual and
environmental exposures. Grounded in the Stress-Diathesis Model of Suicidal Behavior, we will recruit 100
nurses to undergo a series of psychological interviews (e.g., SCID-5-RV and Iowa Gambling Task),
quantitative survey measures using validated instruments, and hair cortisol concentrations every 3 months for
1 year. Further, we will explore genome-scale epigenetic mechanisms that potentiate harmful DNA methylation
on unique gene alleles, which exacerbate suicidal ideation or behavior and can potentially help us to better
understand genetic expression of stress adaptation in the search for biological mechanisms. We aim to identify
modifiable individual and work environment characteristics that could mitigate suicidal ideation or behavior,
even for those at high genetic risk. We will use a range of analytical strategies selected to test interactions and
moderating effects including latent growth curve modeling. The proposed research will be complemented by
experiential and didactic training, along with expert mentorship in the fields of (1) physiologic stress
measurement, (2) suicidology, (3) epigenetics/DNA methylation, (4) longitudinal analysis, and (5) professional
development and dissemination of findings. Results of this K08 application will yield data needed to inform final
variables and measures and a power analysis for a planned R01 submission in Year 5 that proposes a large-
scale longitudinal study in nurses. Overall, this K08 funding would support my path to research independence
and my overall goal of building evidence to better identify high-risk individuals for suicide and to inform the
development of individualized suicide prevention interventions in nurses and similar frontline workforce."
10834251,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - NEW YORK GENOME CHARACTERIZATION CENTER
Large-scale sequencing efforts over the last two decades have been focused on generating DNA sequence
datasets from readily available tissues such as blood or saliva to identify germline variants associated with
disease phenotypes. However, limited progress has been made in characterizing somatic variants in healthy
tissues and their contribution to health and disease over the course of the human lifespan. Somatic variation has
historically been studied in the context of tumor biology; however, there is mounting evidence that somatic
variation plays an important role in the aging process, as well as in cardiovascular, neurodegenerative,
immunologic, and neurodevelopmental diseases. There is therefore a critical need to characterize the somatic
variant landscape in healthy human tissues in individuals of diverse race and ethnicity across the human lifespan.
The Somatic Mosaicism across Human Tissues (SMaHT) program will address this gap by establishing a
cohesive Network that will work together to create high-quality somatic variant catalog; a catalog that is broadly
shareable across the scientific community and that enables studies investigating the rates and patterns of
somatic mosaicism across cell populations and tissues, that can elucidate the mechanisms underlying clonal
development, evolution, and expansion, and that enables studies of the role of somatic mutation in disease
pathogenesis and progression. The New York Genome Characterization Center (NYGCC) will work
collaboratively with other SMaHT Network Centers to generate a high-quality somatic variant catalog using three
core high-depth sequencing assays: duplex whole genome sequencing (WGS), mRNA sequencing, and long-
read Oxford Nanopore WGS. These three core assays will provide an unprecedented and comprehensive view
of somatic mutations across a variety of healthy tissues. The data from deep WGS will enable discovery of
somatic SNVs, indels, mobile elements, copy number changes, and structural variants. The RNA sequencing
data will be used to confirm the presence of those variants that fall in expressed genes, and further evaluate
their effect on splicing. The long read WGS sequencing will be used as a corollary to short read WGS to confirm
and enhance discovery of mobile elements, copy number changes and structural variants. To these core assays
we propose adding single cell WGS sequencing using Direct Library Preparation Plus (DLP+) and genotyping of
transcriptomes (GoT). DLP+ is an amplification-free single cell WGS assay that allows high sensitivity detection
of copy number changes, loss of heterozygosity, and structural variation. It further enables the study of replication
timing, clonal expansion and fitness and is compatible with pooled pseudo-bulk analysis to compare against
deep bulk WGS. The genotyping of transcriptomes assay will allow us to explore, for expressed somatic variants,
the cell type or lineage in which they occurred and by pairing with single cell expression data (and cell surface
marker detection and long read transcript sequencing) the functional effects of these mutations."
10816560,"SUMMARY
Clonal outgrowths are observed across a wide range of normal human tissues. Clones harbor somatic
mutations in known cancer and other driver genes, and show evidence of positive selection. Nevertheless, how
these driver mutations alter the cellular states of cells to allow clones to outcompete wildtype counterparts
remains poorly understood. To date, efforts to chart clonal outgrowths in normal tissues have been largely
limited to genotyping. This is due to the fact that clones often affect a minority of cells in a sample, without
distinguishing cell surface markers or morphological features.
To address this challenge, we developed an array of multi-omic single-cell technologies that are capable of
capturing multiple layers of information (e.g., genotypes, transcriptomes, methylomes, protein expression) from
the same single cells. Moreover, we addressed the specific challenge of genotyping in scRNA-seq in single
cells at high throughput by developing genotyping of transcriptomes. Importantly, this technology turns the
admixture of mutant and wildtype cell from a limitation to an advantage, enabling the direct comparison of
mutant (“winner”) and wildtype (“loser”) cells within the same individual.
Capitalizing on our experience with single-cell technology development, we aim to extend the multi-omics
single-cell GoT (Genotyping of Targeted loci) toolkit to allow to interrogate how somatic mutations lead to
clonal growth advantage. First, we will develop and enhance our targeted single-cell genotyping in the context
of chromatin accessibility (GoT-ChA). This technology critically performs genotyping from DNA directly,
obviating limiting dependencies on mutated loci gene expression. Thus, it can be applied to extracted nuclei,
critical for the SMaHT initiative. We will build on GoT-ChA using nanobody tethered transposases to jointly
profile somatic mutations and histone modifications in single nuclei (GoT-EpiM). To capture transcriptional
changes together with somatic mutation genotyping and chromatin accessibility, we will further use
transposition of mRNA:cDNA hybrid in GoT-ChA-RNA. Finally, we will leverage recent advances that use
antibodies tagged with oligonucleotides to capture mutated loci, chromatin and intra-nuclear proteins such as
transcription factors (GoT-ChA-Pro). In aim 2, we will collaborate with genomic characterization centers to
apply these technologies to primary human samples to define how clonal mutations in normal tissues alter
chromatin, histone modifications, transcriptomes and protein abundance profiles to yield clonal outgrowth.
Our overarching goal is to invoke multi-omic comparisons at the single-cell level between wildtype and mutant
cells to comprehensively identify the underpinnings of fitness advantage in clonal outgrowth. The proposed
comprehensive GoT toolkit will enable to link, at high throughout single-cell genotypes with transcriptional,
protein, and epigenetic, with important implication in the study of clonal mosaicism as a harbinger of cancer, as
well as other human health outcomes."
10878942,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The world around us has a statistical structure that we can use to improve our choices. Learning the underlying
structure by identifying key features, such as the rate of change, is useful for adapting and optimizing our
decision-making strategies. However, learning these features requires accumulating evidence across multiple
timescales: a short timescale that considers explicit evidence for the current decision, and a long timescale that
supports latent environmental feature inference. In the brain, evidence accumulation across timescales
necessary for flexible decision-making should therefore engage contextual memory in regions such as
hippocampus (HC). This proposal aims to identify cognitive strategies and neural mechanisms humans
use to accumulate evidence across timescales for adaptive decision-making. Using an interdisciplinary
approach that utilizes computational modeling to develop and validate human behavioral and human
electrophysiological experiments, I will 1) identify the variety of decision strategies humans use to support
multi-timescale inference, 2) model plausible neural mechanisms of human cognitive strategies, and 3) define
HC’s role in implementing multi-timescale inference. This work is in line with the BRAIN initiative’s mission to
link behavior and function and priority research areas 5 (Theory and Data Analysis tools) and 6 (Human
Neuroscience). With my outstanding mentor team, who have combined expertise in theory and experimental
work, the mentored phase of this grant will provide me with 1) additional research skills in both static
inference models and neural-circuit modeling and 2) career development through personalized mentorship,
writing, and scientific communication training. The University of Colorado Boulder offers an ideal environment
for this work, with numerous resources between the departments of Applied Math, Psychology and Institute for
Cognitive Science. Additionally, with the availability of many programs and seminars online, resources at
co-mentor institutions University of Pennsylvania and University of Houston are also accessible. The
independent phase research will combine this additional training with my previous experience in human
electrophysiology and signal processing to study the role of HC in flexible decision-making, analyzing human
neural recordings from epilepsy patients while they perform a multi-timescale decision-making task recorded
by my collaborators at University of Utah. My long term goals are to launch my own lab that applies a
multimodal approach of theory, human behavior, and human neural electrophysiology to identifying the
cognitive and neural strategies associated with flexible decision-making and the impacts that pathological
disruptions have on these processes."

Currently, 9% of the US population is diabetic, and an additional 86 million are being treated for
pre-diabetes. Beyond this, one in every four Veteran receiving care from the VA is being treated
for diabetes and its many physical complications, with more than half suffering from diabetic
retinopathy. Making diabetic retinopathy a disease with a high healthcare burden in the Veteran
population. Diabetic retinopathy is a microvascular disease of the retina, and is the leading
cause of blindness in the working-age population worldwide. With such a significant health
impact, new therapeutics is required to stay abreast of the financial and physical threat posed
by this visual disease. One of the most promising sources of such a therapeutic target lies within
the immune system. The alteration of the immune system mediates much of the pathogenesis in
diabetic complications through protein cytokine production, with IL-17A being one of the most
prevalent cytokines involved in the onset and progression of diabetes. In our previous studies,
we discovered that diabetes induced IL-17A production, which enhanced retinal inflammation,
oxidative stress, vascular impairment, and the onset of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy in
murine models of diabetes. In the current study we will examine if IL-17A plays the same
pathologic role in the progression of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, proliferative diabetic
retinopathy, and diabetic macular edema in our VA patients. Further, previous cancer studies
provide evidence that IL-17A induces anti-VEGF drug resistance. Here we will examine if IL-17A
plays the same role in patients that do not respond to anti-VEGF treatments for diabetic
retinopathy. Taken together, these studies will define the role of IL-17A in the onset and
progression of diabetic retinopathy, while potentially identifying a novel therapeutic for retinal
pathogenesis."

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most devastating gastrointestinal pathology in the newborn period.
Although the pathogenesis is unclear, evidence suggests prematurity and formula feeding play major roles in
NEC. Our long-term goal is to identify strategies that promote postnatal maturation and barrier function in infants
at risk of NEC. Our compelling data show that hyaluronan (HA) in human milk (HM) is a promising bioactive
factor that accelerate small intestinal maturation and protect against the development of NEC. HA is a unique
nonsulfated glycosaminoglycan present in high concentrations in colostrum and HM in the first weeks of lactation.
We previously showed that oral administration of 35kDa HA ( HA35), a mimic of HM HA, increases intestinal
epithelial proliferation, differentiation into Paneth and goblet cells, and expression of tight junction proteins. We
also showed that oral HA35 reduces the severity of the intestinal injury, bacterial translocation, and decreases
mortality in a NEC-like intestinal injury model. Using RNA-Seq, immunohistochemistry, and western blot
analyses, we identified the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1)-mediated pathway
was upregulated in ileal tissues by HA35 treatment. mTOR is a serine/threonine-protein kinase and a member
of the PI3K-related kinase family, which complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2. Studies suggest mTORC1
regulates Paneth and goblet cells under normal conditions, and promotes intestinal stem cell activity and
epithelial repair post-radiation injury and adult colitis model. Despite emerging evidence supporting its critical
role in epithelial homeostasis and regeneration, the role of mTORC1 in NEC is largely unknown. We hypothesize
that the effects of HA35 are mediated, at least in part, through activation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway.
Since activation of mTORC1 promotes proliferation, differentiation, and regeneration of the gut, we also
hypothesize that modulating the mTORC1 pathway is a potential therapeutic approach in preventing/treating
NEC. At the end of this project, we will : (i) determine the role of HA35 and mTORC1 signaling in homeostasis
and in NEC-like injury models (ii) understand the involvement of the mTOR pathway in the pathogenesis of NEC;
and (iii) establish the basis of HA35 as a novel dietary supplement that promotes epithelial protection in infants
at risk of NEC. To achieve these goals, we assembled a well-integrated team of scientists and clinicians with
complementary expertise in mTORC1 signaling pathway, murine modeling of NEC, and human premature
enteroid models of intestinal development and injury. The results of our proposal have the potential to greatly
enhance our understanding of NEC pathogenesis, and potentially provide novel insight into effective preventative
therapies."

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has produced extraordinary clinical responses in more than 25 tumor
types. However, only a small number of patients benefit from this therapy owing to the immunosuppressive tu-
mor microenvironment (TME). As one of the major components of the TME, tumor-associated macrophages
(TAMs) usually possess profound inhibitory activity against tumor-killing T cells and facilitate tumor escape
from immunotherapy. Clinical findings have shown that the presence of suppressive pro-tumorigenic TAMs
correlates with reduced survival in bladder cancer patients treated with immunotherapy. Due to the plasticity of
macrophages, excitement has been growing to reshape the pro-tumorigenic TAMs toward the anti-tumorigenic
phenotype to stimulate the immunity against cancer. Emerging evidence reveals that this process of macro-
phage polarization is inextricably affected by metabolites in the TME, such as free fatty acid (FFA). Lack of
data regarding the role of FFA signals in macrophages prevents us from designing an elegant approach to re-
polarizing TAM to foster a better anti-tumor T cell response. We propose to dissect the molecular basis of the
FFA-mediated signal pathway in TAMs differentiation and its role in resistance to PD-1 blockade, which can be
leveraged to restore sensitivity to ICB therapy. Our analysis of published datasets revealed that TAMs from
human bladder tumors uniquely express elevated levels of a fatty acid receptor, G Protein-Coupled Receptor
84 (GPR84). These GPR84 expressing cells exhibited enriched hallmarks of anti-tumorigenic function com-
pared to their counterpart. Further analysis reveals that expression of GPR84 significantly correlates with
longer survival in bladder cancer patients. Our work shows that genetic ablation of GPR84 leads to enhanced
production of inhibitory molecules including Arginase 1 via activation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta
(C/EBPβ). By contrast, GPR84 activation by its agonist 6-OAU can reprogram pro-tumorigenic macrophages to
produce anti-tumorigenic signature molecules, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα). Mechanistically, we
found that GPR84 potentiates the activity of Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) to enhance TNFα production.
Central hypothesis: GPR84 serves as a metabolic signaling checkpoint for determining the function of macro-
phage by restricting the immunosuppressive while promoting the immune-stimulating phenotype. Treatment
with GPR84 agonists significantly retards tumor growth and increases the anti-tumor efficacy of anti-PD-1 mAb
therapy in a MB49 bladder cancer model. Aim 1: Determine whether the lack of GPR84 promotes the polariza-
tion of immunosuppressive TAMs. Aim 2: Dissect the molecular and epigenetic mechanisms by which GPR84
signaling promotes an immune-stimulating phenotype in macrophages. Aim 3: Determine whether targeting
GPR84-mediated macrophage repolarization enhances the anti-tumor efficacy of ICB. Results will inform the
development of promising treatments to reshape immunosuppressive TME through manipulation of metabolic
signaling, and thereby restore responsiveness to PD-1 blockade for bladder cancer patients."

Glaucoma is characterized by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death leading to vision loss. Available treatment
modalities continue to rely on intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction, which is insufficient to prevent progressive
neurodegeneration in a significant number of glaucoma patients. In the fight against this blinding disease,
treatment strategies that do not rely on IOP-lowering are urgently needed. In this proposal, we hypothesize that
glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists protect against glaucomatous neurodegeneration by
decreasing microglia/macrophage activation and retinal macrophage infiltration, in turn preventing reactive
astrogliosis resulting in RGC rescue. This hypothesis builds upon our prior study showing that induced ocular
hypertension in a mouse model of glaucoma triggers microglia/macrophage activation and reactive astrocyte
formation in the retina. We found that treatment with the long-acting GLP-1R agonist NLY01 suppressed
microglia/macrophage activation, prevented reactive astrogliosis, and rescued RGCs following IOP elevation.
Further, our examination of insurance claims data showed that treatment with GLP-1R agonists, FDA-approved
to treat diabetes and for weight loss, is associated with decreased glaucoma risk in humans. However, the retinal
cell type(s) mediating GLP-1R agonists' RGC protection have not been identified. Further, it is not known whether
systemic macrophage infiltration and/or resident microglia transformation drive early inflammation, and whether
NLY01 modifies this response. Finally, whether this favorable response to NLY01 treatment generalizes beyond
induced IOP elevation to inherited models of chronic, progressive glaucoma is unknown. This proposal will
pursue 2 specific aims crucial to evaluating GLP-1R agonists' mechanism of action and the potential GLP-1R
agonists hold as novel glaucoma therapy: 1) Determine the mechanisms through which the GLP-1R agonist
NLY01 rescues RGCs following IOP elevation, and 2) Determine the mechanisms of GLP-1R agonist-mediated
neural rescue in an inherited model of glaucoma. Findings will determine: 1) the systemic cell type(s) facilitating
NLY01's RGC rescue, including whether macrophage infiltration drives early inflammation in response to ocular
hypertension, and 2) whether the GLP-1R agonist NLY01 exerts a long-term anti-inflammatory effect to rescue
RGCs in the DBA/2J mouse model of glaucoma. This proposal is the first step in a broader plan to disentangle
systemic effects of GLP-1R activation driving neuronal rescue. Results will serve to advance our understanding
of glaucoma pathogenesis, identify the mechanisms driving NLY01-mediated RGC rescue, and elucidate the
potential for using GLP-1R agonists in glaucoma treatment."
10889195,"The current epidemic of opioid overdoses has been propelled by both illicit and prescribed narcotic pain
medications. Extensive opioid use and repeated abstinence increases the likelihood of severe withdrawal and
perpetuates the vulnerability to relapse via means of negative reinforcement. The negative emotional valence
of withdrawal can last long after the initial, dramatic physical signs, involving a protracted negative emotional
state, drug craving, and a high likelihood of relapse. These combined symptoms are commonly referred to as
being “dope sick”. Addicted individuals often prefer to continue drugs rather than face withdrawal. Being
“dope-sick” has many attributes of a severe inflammatory state and this led us to investigate the involvement of
microglia, the innate immune cells that reside in the brain, in opioid tolerance and withdrawal, and this was
supported by a CEBRA R21 grant (R21-DA044757).
That CEBRA R21 grant resulted in our findings of dramatic changes in ribosome-bound mRNAs—the
“translatome”—in microglia using RNA sequencing of RiboTag purified microglial RNAs. Those results
provided us with the leads that form that basis for this proposal. Many of the changes related to cyclic AMP
signaling and its downstream targets, and experimental chemogenetic stimulation of Gi/o signaling was found
to actually worsen opioid withdrawal. With the understanding that glia are partners in plasticity, we suspect that
the relapsing/remitting nature of opioid dependence serves to prime and condition microglia, shifting the impact
from tempering withdrawal during initial stages to exacerbating withdrawal and opioid seeking after multiple
cycles of tolerance and withdrawal. Thus, investigations into the role of glia in withdrawal may provide new
therapeutic avenues. We propose three Aims using fentanyl and a recently developed transgenic mouse that
allows conditional and microglia-specific Cre and TdTomato expression without disrupting microglia function. In
Aim 1 we will analyze the trajectory of the changing microglial translatome after one vs. five cycles of opioid
dependence and spontaneous withdrawal. In Aim 2 we will examine the physical and behavioral
consequences of one vs. five cycles of opioid dependence and withdrawal, to explore the idea that intermittent
cycles of dependence and withdrawal exacerbate the negative consequences of withdrawal. We will then
investigate the hypothesis that the purinergic receptors P2Y12 and P2X7 are involved in microglial responses
during initial and delayed phases of opioid withdrawal. In Aim 3 we will use an in vitro brain slice model with 2-
photon confocal imaging of microglia. We will study the microstructure and motility of microglia using time-
lapse microscopy. We will measure real-time changes in cyclic AMP using a FRET-based biosensor and
calcium dynamics with GCaMP6. These three Aims integrate the temporal, behavioral, and molecular
consequences of microglial engagement during opioid dependence and withdrawal."

About 1.3 million people suffer from IBD (chronic inflammation of the intestine) in the United States. The etiology 
of IBD remains elusive and preventive measures or a cure are not available. Inflammasomes and derived 
cytokines IL-1β are being intensely investigated as the signaling hub that is dys-regulated in inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD). IL-1β is synthesized as inactive pro-forms with no secretory signal sequence. Recent studies 
have found that a lipid binding protein, Gasdermin D (GSDMD), is required for release of IL-1β in response to 
caspase-1/11 inflammasome activation. This breakthrough led to a rapid growth of literature that focuses on the 
pore forming and associated pyroptotic activity of GSDMD in myeloid cells. Interestingly, we discovered a novel 
nonpyrototic role of GSDMD in guiding the release of IL-1β containing vesicles from intestinal epithelia cells and 
T cells in response to Caspase 8 (Casp8) but not casp1 activation. Through unbiased proteomic analysis, we 
identified a set of novel GSDMD-interacting proteins in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), including NEDD4 (an E3 
ligase) and the Hsp90 co-chaperone CDC37. Ablation of GSDMD or NEDD4 abolished LPS and ATP-induced 
IL-1β production from IECs. Strikingly, LPS+ATP stimulation led to the polyubiquitination of pro-IL-1β, which was 
secreted and processed into mature IL-1β along with a complex containing full-length GSDMD, Hsp90/CDC37, 
NEDD4, Atg7, Casp8 but not Casp1. In vitro ubiquitination assay demonstrated that NEDD4, known to interact 
with LC3 and promote cargo loading into secretory vesicles, catalyzed the polyubiquitination of pro-IL-1β. Indeed, 
while GSDMD was associated with LC3+ vesicles; GSDMD-dependent release of extracellular vesicles (< 200 
nm) were detected by electron microscopy, which contains the GSDMD/NEDD4/IL-1β complex. Moreover, 
inactivating mutation in the Asp276 of GSDMD, which abolishes its pore-forming and pyroptotic activity, did not 
impact the GSDMD-guided IL-1β secretion from IECs. In TH17 cells, a T helper cell subset highly relevant to 
intestinal inflammation, this GSDMD-guided secretion of polyubiquitinated pro-IL-1β complex (GSDMD, Hsp90, 
Casp8 and NEDD4) was also readily detected in response to ATP stimulation and TCR activation. Collectively, 
the data revealed a novel nonpyroptotic role for GSDMD in IL-1β release from non-myeloid cells. The pathogenic 
role of the GSDMD-guided IL-1β release was investigated in two mouse models of intestinal inflammation. Firstly, 
while polyubiquitinated pro-IL-1β, mIL-1β and the GSDMD/NEDD4-secretary complex were induced in a 
GSDMD-dependent manner in the intestinal explants in response to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induce colitis, 
GSDMD-deficiency attenuated the intestinal inflammation. Secondly, GSDMD or IL-1β deficiency in naïve T cells 
reduced their ability to elicit intestinal inflammation. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the GSDMD 
mediates distinct pathways (guided secretion and pyroptosis) for IL-1β release in non-myeloid and myeloid cells, 
which jointly contribute to the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation in a coordinated manner. We will test this 
hypothesis through the following aims: (1) Investigate the molecular mechanism for GSDMD-guided secretory 
pathway for IL-1β release; (2) Investigate the cell-type and pathway-specific role of GSDMD-IL-1β axis in 
intestinal inflammation, including GSDMD-mediated pyroptotic versus GSDMD-guided IL-1β secretion on the 
intestinal inflammation."
10789939,"The behavioral state of an animal – whether it is active, inactive, mating, or fighting – profoundly influences
how it generates behavioral responses to environmental cues. However, because the environment is
constantly changing, animals often switch behavioral states in a sensory-driven manner. Over longer
timescales, experience and physiological changes may further bias animals towards certain states. For
example, a starved animal may exhibit a higher probability of switching to a stable dwell ing state upon
smelling a food odor, compared to a fed animal. How the nervous system flexibly changes so that animals
generate context-appropriate behavioral states remains poorly understood. To understand how sensory
cues influence behavioral states and how the links between sensory cues and behavioral states can flexibly
change, it will be critical to examine how neurons at the sensory periphery feed into key neural populations
that control behavioral states. Physiological changes like starvation may influence sensory circuits
themselves, as well as the interactions of these circuits with downstream neurons that control behavioral
states. The C. elegans nervous system is particularly attractive for these types of whole-circuit problems in
neuroscience because (a) it consists of exactly 302 neurons, (b) every neuron can be identified in every
animal, (c) the synaptic connections between these neurons are known, and (d) genetic tools allow us to
manipulate single cells in this system. While feeding, C. elegans switch between two stable behavioral
states: dwelling states, where they reduce their movement to exploit a food patch, and roaming states, where
they display fast locomotion to explore for a better food source. The generation of roaming and dwelling
states is influenced by the animal’s ingestion of food, detection of olfactory cues, and satiety. Although it is
clear that these states are influenced by olfactory cues and satiety, the molecular pathways and neural
circuits that mediate these effects are poorly understood. Here, we propose to build off new preliminary data
that gives us a unique opportunity to uncover these mechanisms. We found that food deprivation leads to a
broad change in olfactory receptor expression in food-sensing olfactory neurons, which in turn impacts the
roaming/dwelling state of the animal. We have also characterized the functional architecture of the core
neural circuit that generates roaming and dwelling states. This now gives us an opportunity to examine how
inputs from a defined set of chemosensory neurons (whose sensory receptors dynamically change) are
integrated by downstream circuits to flexibly control behavioral states. We will first uncover molecular and
neural pathways that allow diverse external and internal cues to modulate olfactory receptor expression in
defined C. elegans neurons (Aim 1). Then, we will examine how ensembles of chemosensory neurons
influence activity in the roaming-dwelling circuit across satiety states (Aim 2). This work will result in a new
paradigm for understanding how populations of neurons at the sensory periphery flexibly control behavior."
10821485,"Periosteum, a primary site of the fracture healing response, is highly vascularized and densely
innervated. Studies on bone fracture have primarily focused on the role of growth factors and vascularization
in the healing process, but we postulate that sensory nerve signals are a critical part of the regulatory
mechanism that initiate the stem/progenitor cell responses required for fracture callus formation. A number of
lines of evidence point to sensory innervation, or signals associated with sensory nerves as promoters of
bone accrual and healing. For example, fracture healing is impaired following chemical sensory denervation,
but the sensory nerve-derived signals that promote healing as not yet defined. We hypothesize that damage
to sensory nerves in the periosteum orchestrates the bone-healing cascade through calcitonin gene-related
peptide (CGRP) – calcitonin like receptor (CLR) signaling. This is important given that multiple CGRP
inhibitors were recently approved by the FDA for prevention and treatment of migraines.
 In Aim 1 we will evaluate the effects of CGRP inhibitors on bone healing. Given that CGRP plays a
role in bone turnover and potentially healing, it is important to understand the impact of CGRP inhibition on
fracture healing. In the Aim 2, we will determine which cell lineage or lineages responsive to CGRP signals
during healing using targeted deletion of the CLR receptor. CLR deletion in early fracture healing will be
targeted to the following lineages using inducible Cre’s: MPCs (αSMA-CreER), chondrocyte (Acan)-CreER,
osteoblasts using Col2.3CreER and in endothelial (Cdh5-CreER) during fracture healing. The effects on
callus formation and strength, as well as differentiation in the callus will be determined. We will examine
cellular mechanisms of CGRP/CLR action utilizing in vivo approaches to study MPC expansion, differentiation
and vascularization. We propose to dissect CLR signaling by distinguishing effects of the ligands. The main
ligands are CGRP and Adrenomedullin that act via CLR and RAMP, of which CLR-RAMP1 is main complex
for CGRP signaling while CLR-RAMP2 and RAMP3 is responsible for ADM signal activation. In Aim 3 we will
evaluate effects of ADM deletion in mesenchymal population using ADMfl/fl mice. We will also define
downstream signaling mechanism of CLR deletion in MSCs and endothelial cells using 10x genomics.
 Our study will also provide critical information on the effects that newly approved inhibitors of CGRP
signaling exhibit on bone healing and what cellular mechanisms affect healing via CLR receptor Finally,
testing approaches to modulate CGRP/CLR sensory singling may lead to a therapeutic strategy to enhance
bone healing."
10825606,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Episodic memories are representations of our personal past, anchored to time and space. Episodic
memory impairments in neurological disorders like epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, and Alzheimer’s Disease
significantly limit patients’ ability to work and live independently. In everyday life, the brain must process the
continuous present to form discrete memories of the past. This ability to parse experience into meaningful
chunks, termed event segmentation, is foundational to human episodic memory. Functional neuroimaging
studies suggest that the hippocampus and a posterior cortical network demonstrate a simultaneous increase in
activity at event boundaries and endings, but the neural events supporting this demarcation are unknown.
Numerous rodent studies suggest that neural oscillations—particularly theta, gamma, and sharp-wave ripple
(SWR) activity—coordinate hippocampal-neocortical interactions at these critical junctures.
 Our long-term goal is to discover how the brain organizes and consolidates continuous experience under
naturalistic circumstances. The objective of this proposal is to measure the hippocampal-neocortical dynamics
at key moments in episodic memory. Our central hypothesis is that the hippocampus plays a critical role in
segmenting and consolidating information delivered from the neocortex, via enhanced theta-gamma activity at
event boundaries and increased SWR rate during post-viewing rest. To test these main hypotheses, we will
obtain intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from epilepsy patients undergoing invasive monitoring for surgical
treatment. Subjects will view a series of short films that possess a narrative structure and sequence, then will
be asked to recall selected content. Upon successful completion of this project, we will accomplish the
following aims: Aim 1. To measure the relative contributions of hippocampus and PMN to event segmentation
during film viewing. Aim 2. To measure the hippocampal contribution to memory consolidation during post-
viewing rest. Aim 3. To test the necessity of the hippocampus for event segmentation through electrical
stimulation (ES).
 This proposal represents a significant advance from prior work in the cognitive neuroscience of memory by
using iEEG to determine the hippocampal-neocortical oscillations involved in remembering naturalistic events.
This project is innovative in concept and method because of (1) the use of short films to investigate human
episodic memory; (2) the translation of key neurophysiological findings in rodent memory to human episodic
memory; and (3) establishing the necessity of the hippocampus in event segmentation and memory
performance through ES. Our findings will advance mechanism-guided approaches to the assessment and
remediation of memory dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders such as epilepsy and traumatic brain injury."
10852910,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hypertension (HTN) is the most common cardiovascular (CV) comorbidity among patients with breast cancer
and is an important modifiable risk factor for adverse CV events during and after cancer treatment. Work by our
group and others has shown that HTN is an important risk factor for cardiotoxicity caused by curative breast
cancer treatments including anthracyclines and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) targeted
agents, which occurs in up to 20% of patients receiving these therapies and presents with a reduced left
ventricular ejection fraction or heart failure. Furthermore, cardiotoxicity is a leading treatment-limiting toxicity that
interferes with curative cancer treatment delivery, worsens cancer outcomes, and leads to persistent impairment
of cardiorespiratory fitness in long-term survivors of breast cancer. CV disease is now a leading cause of
morbidity and mortality among breast cancer survivors who are living longer due to advances in cancer care,
therefore strategies to mitigate CV risk in patients with breast cancer are critically needed. No standard treatment
option is currently available to prevent cardiotoxicity during cancer treatment, and no guidelines exist to inform
the optimal approach to blood pressure control during cancer treatment. Multiple trials have shown that intensive
blood pressure control is associated with CV risk reductions, however exclusion of patients with cancer
represents an important limitation of these trials. The association between HTN and cardiotoxicity risk provide a
strong rationale for optimizing blood pressure control to improve CV health and reduce cardiotoxicity risk in
patients with HTN who are most vulnerable, however no previous trial has assessed the role of intensive blood
pressure control on the cardiotoxic effects of breast cancer treatment. The objective of this study is therefore to
evaluate intensive systolic blood pressure (SBP) control in women with HTN at risk for cardiotoxicity during BC
treatment and the effects of intensive SBP control on biomarkers (imaging, functional, and circulating) of
cardiotoxicity. Using a randomized controlled trial design, 130 patients with breast cancer at increased risk for
cardiotoxicity (defined by baseline SBP ≥130 mm Hg and treatment with anthracyclines with or without HER2-
targeted therapy) will be randomly allocated (ratio 1:1) to intensive SBP control (goal SBP <120 mm Hg) versus
standard SBP control (goal SBP <140 mm Hg) prior to initiating breast cancer treatment. Aim 1: Evaluate the
efficacy of an intensive SBP control intervention during active BC treatment in patients at risk for cardiotoxicity.
Aim 2: Evaluate the effects of intensive SBP control on imaging and functional biomarkers of cardiotoxicity. Aim
3: Assess the effect of intensive SBP control on circulating biomarkers of cardiotoxicity. The results from this
investigation will: 1) establish critical data to inform clinical implementation of intensive SBP control for patients
with breast cancer at risk for cardiotoxicity, 2) provide functional and mechanistic insights into the effects of
intensive SBP control on mitigation of cardiotoxicity risk, and 3) guide future cardio-oncology practice
recommendations on the role of HTN management to improve CV health in patients with cancer."
10833210,"Heme oxygenases (HO2 and HO2) and Rev-Erbβ play critical roles in cytoprotection and in heme-dependent
CO metabolism and signaling. HO2 and Rev-Erbβ exhibit similarities in their modes of heme and thiol-disulfide
redox regulation via their heme responsive motifs (HRMs). HO1 and HO2 are the sole heme degrading systems
in mammals. The HOs are cytoprotective, catalyzing heme degradation to avert toxic heme buildup (>1 µM). In
addition, HO produces both the cytoprotective signaling molecule CO and biliverdin (precursor of the antioxidant,
bilirubin). Thus, HO1 and HO2 play a protective role against cardiovascular, renal, and central nervous system
pathologies induced by heme/Fe-related oxidative stress. Rev-Erbβ, is a transcriptional repressor, exerting wide
control of metabolism, inflammatory responses, and the circadian rhythm. Decreased Rev-Erb levels disrupt lipid
homeostasis and cause abnormalities in heart functions like cardiac mitochondrial function, metabolism,
signaling, and contractile function. HO2 binds three equivalents of heme, one at its catalytic site and another at
each of its two regulatory heme responsive motifs (HRMs), whereas Rev-Erbβ binds a single heme at its HRM.
HO1 binds a single heme at its catalytic core, which is highly conserved with HO2. We recently described novel
roles for the HO2 catalytic core in regulating cellular heme bioavailability via heme sequestration and committing
HO2 to lysosomal degradation under heme deficiency. We will now tackle how HO2 coordinates these processes
for achieving cellular heme homeostasis and to determine if the inducible HO1 plays a similar sequestration role
in heme bioavailability. We also uncovered novel roles for the HRMs in HO2 in shuttling heme to the catalytic
site and in interacting with heme chaperones. We will now address the cellular relevance of these in vitro data
and whether the chaperone transfers heme directly to the catalytic core or, as we propose, to the HRM-containing
tail of HO2. Having successfully incorporated full-length-HO2 with its membrane-binding region into nanodiscs
and liposomes, we will now compare the properties of this most physiologically relevant form of HO in its
membrane environment with those of the soluble protein. We recently discovered that the cellular form of heme,
as well as the most bioavailable form, is oxidized (in the Fe3+ state). We also identified a coupling mechanism
within hemeproteins that drives conversion of their resting Fe3+ state to the Fe2+-CO state. We next intend to
elucidate the cellular mechanism of Rev-Erbβ regulation starting from heme loading to carbonylation.
Furthermore, we plan to reveal whether cytoprotective CO, which is generated by HO, is transferred locally and
directly through a protein-protein complex formed between HO and Rev-Erb or if HO-generated CO travels to
target proteins by passive cellular diffusion. Our research will help us to understand HO’s involvement in cellular
protection against oxidative stress-induced cardiovascular, renal, and central nervous system pathologies and
why dysfunction in Rev-erbβ is associated with disorders in metabolism, circadian rhythm, and inflammation."
10894288,"BACKGROUND: Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) accounts for approximately 10-15% of all breast cancers and
is characterized by hormone receptor positivity (HR+), lack of HER2 amplification, low Ki-67 score, and loss of
cell adhesion receptors such as e-cadherin. While these tumors tend to be indolent initially, late recurrences and
distant metastasis are common. Effective systemic treatments that can improve both surgical and long-term
outcomes for these patients are needed. ILC has very low rates of pathologic complete response (pCR) to both
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (3%) and neoadjuvant endocrine therapies (ET, 0%). HER2 mutations are enriched
in about 5-10% of unselected ILC, with some reports showing the prevalence as high as 27% in pleomorphic
and higher grade ILCs. HER2 mutations in ILC are associated with antiestrogen resistance and a worse
prognosis.
Neratinib, an FDA-approved adjuvant treatment for HER2-amplified (HER2+) early-stage breast cancer, has
shown safety and efficacy in combination with ET in metastatic HER2-mutant HR+ breast cancer. Our hypothesis
is that the combination of neratinib and ET will improve clinical and molecular activity in HER2-mutant HR+ ILC,
representing a novel and rational neoadjuvant therapy option.
TRIAL DESIGN: We propose an unblinded, multi-institutional Phase II clinical trial for 30 patients with Stage I-
III ILCs with HER2 mutations. Patients will be initially randomized to either 4 weeks of neratinib + ET OR ET
alone; a biopsy will be done at the end of the lead-in phase. All patients then will receive a combination of 20
weeks of ET and neratinib prior to proceeding to surgery.
KEY ENDPOINTS: The primary objective of this study is to determine the pre-operative endocrine prognostic
index (PEPI) score on the surgical sample in these patients. The secondary clinical objectives will be to evaluate
the pCR rate, residual cancer burden (RCB) index, and rates of breast conserving surgery. In addition, we
propose correlative studies that will promote understanding of how neratinib synergizes with antiestrogen
therapies by evaluating tumor cell cycle arrest and apoptosis markers in the pre-treatment and on-treatment (4
week) biopsy in both the ET ± neratinib arms. Finally, we will study the longitudinal evolution of therapy tolerance
and resistance in HER2-mutated breast cancer. We will develop patient-derived organoids and perform single-
cell RNA and ATAC sequencing and DNA sequencing to elucidate transcriptional and epigenetic programs that
permit breast cancer survival upon continuous HER2-directed therapy and somatic alterations that drive
resistance.
We hypothesize that the combination of neratinib and ET will improve clinical and molecular activity in HER2-
mutant HR+ ILC, addressing an unmet need for this challenging to treat breast cancer subtype."
10892158,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 A collaborative network of research teams from Stanford, Harvard, The Ohio State University, and
Impactivo, LLC propose practice-relevant research focused on diabetes care in federally qualified health
centers (FQHCs). Some 37.3 million Americans have type 2 diabetes and significant racial and socioeconomic
disparities persist in care quality and patient safety. FQHCs serve 1 in 7 U.S. racial/ethnic minorities and
shoulder a higher prevalence of diabetes (21% FQHC, 11% U.S.), offering a promising venue for innovating in
equity-focused diabetes care. The iPATH project will refine and implement an approach to practice
transformation originally conceived to support FQHCs’ pursuit of National Committee for Quality Assurance
recognition as patient-centered medical homes. A pilot demonstrated significant decreases (average 31%
reduction) in poorly controlled diabetes (A1c>9%) among patients at 7 clinics affiliated with an FQHC in Puerto
Rico in 2017-20. Improvements in patients’ diabetes control were sustained pre- to post- Covid-19 pandemic.
 Aim 1. Refine the iPATH implementation approach by identifying organizational conditions and
processes at FQHCs that promoted or impeded the effectiveness of type 2 diabetes care for NIH-
designated U.S. health disparity populations pre- and post-pandemic. Research teams will
simultaneously conduct 12 in-depth regional case studies, enabling contrast between FQHCs considered high-
performing and low-performing for diabetes control. Teams will identify actionable, how-to implementation
factors for ensuring chronic, preventive, and acute care for patients with diabetes. Employing an innovative
Rapid Data Collection and Reporting methodology, teams will rapidly collect, analyze, and share data to
accelerate dissemination of customized feedback to FQHC leaders and to inform adaptation and
implementation of the iPATH practice transformation.
 Aim 2. Implement a multi-level, multi-component, technology-enabled practice transformation
strategy to improve type 2 diabetes for patients at 8 multi-clinic FQHCs. Teams will adapt, tailor,
implement, test, and spread an equity-focused practice transformation strategy across FQHCs located in
California, Massachusetts, Ohio, and Puerto Rico. The iPATH implementation approach will be modularized
and customizable to accommodate organizational readiness, patient needs, and social contexts, tailoring
practice transformation efforts to each unique FQHC.
 Aim 3. Comprehensively evaluate the iPATH implementation approach with a hybrid type 2 study,
including a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial. Including formative, process, and summative
evaluation elements guided by the Exploration-Preparation-Implementation-Sustainment model, the study will
evaluate impact of practice transformation and identify process elements affecting implementation
effectiveness. Analyses will leverage FQHC data by race and ethnicity to examine health disparities."

Following influenza A virus (IAV) infection, the risk for subsequent pneumococcal pneumonia caused by
Streptococcus pneumoniae is enhanced 100-fold. Host aging is associated with more severe outcomes, thus
novel approaches that boost resistance to infections are needed. Our goal is to elucidate how IAV infection
alters the responses of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and the extracellular adenosine (EAD) pathway
across host age, during pneumococcal pneumonia. Background: Following primary S. pneumoniae infection,
PMNs, which are innate immune cells whose function declines with age, are required for controlling bacterial
numbers. EAD, which is produced from breakdown of ATP leaking from injured cells by CD73, controls PMN
responses during infection. We found that CD73 was crucial for host resistance and PMN pulmonary influx as
well as anti-microbial function during primary pneumococcal pneumonia. Importantly, old mice had significant
changes in expression of EAD enzymes and receptors and targeting this pathway reversed the age-driven
susceptibility to primary pneumococcal infection. In humans, pneumococcal carriage in the nasopharynx is a
prerequisite to invasive diseases. Further, IAV infection of the respiratory tract where it triggers epithelial
damage and impairs host antibacterial responses is key for the lethal synergy of co-infection. However, animal
models incorporating the evolution of S. pneumoniae from colonizer to pathogen during IAV co-infection while
mimicking the severe disease seen in humans, are lacking. Therefore, we established an optimized model
where mice are intra-nasally colonized with pneumococci followed by IAV infection of the nasopharynx and
lungs. This model resulted in obvious signs of illness and lethality in half of the young mice and importantly,
reproduced the susceptibility of aging, where significantly more old mice displayed severe clinical signs and
succumbed to lethality compared to young controls. Using this model, we strikingly found that the role of CD73
was reversed, where CD73 became detrimental to resistance of young hosts to co-infection. This highlighted
that IAV infection triggers profound changes in the interaction of the host with pneumococci. However, the
effect of polymicrobial infections on host responses and the mechanisms behind that remain a gap in the field.
Here we will use our improved model to test the Hypothesis that IAV infection alters CD73-mediated control of
PMN responses to pneumococcal infection across host age using two specific Aims: 1) Test the effect of age
and IAV infection on PMN responses during secondary pneumococcal pneumonia; 2) Test the role of CD73 in
PMN responses and host resistance to S. pneumoniae/IAV co-infection. Significance/innovation/ relevance:
Using this physiologically relevant model that mimics aspects of human disease to elucidate how PMN
responses change in mono vs polymicrobial infections across host age and the role of CD73 in that, has the
potential to uncover novel pathways that drive host susceptibly to infection. This work can lead to highly
innovative approaches incorporating adenosine-based drugs to combat this serious lung disease."
10873784,"Cannabis is one of the most widely used psychotropic drugs in the United States and changes in public policy
are expected to further increase use. Current cultivars of cannabis have been selected for high Δ9-
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) levels and THC levels have tripled over the past few decades. There is increasing
evidence that use of high potency cannabis containing high levels of THC increases the risk of adverse health
and behavioral consequences. Many of the specific effectors (e.g., receptors, receptor signaling pathways)
mediating response to THC have not yet been fully identified and virtually nothing is known about how
individual genetic differences influence response. This lack of knowledge represents a critical barrier in
understanding health risks and behaviors associated with high potency cannabis use. To address these issues
we have developed a powerful pharmacogenomic screen in the BXD recombinant inbred mouse population to
identify gene variants in effector proteins that regulate cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1) levels, signal
transduction, termination of signaling, and/or trafficking following acute exposure to high-dose (10 mg/kg, i.p.)
THC. Previously, we demonstrated strain differences in the level of the major effector of THC responses, CB1,
between BXD parental strains and demonstrated heritable variation in acute responses to THC in parental
strains and BXDs. We have already identified suggestive quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and candidate causal
QTL genes (QTGs) in our pharmacogenomic screen using only a subset (i.e., 20) of BXDs. Here, we expand
our work to identify genetic modulators of CB1 protein levels (Aim 1) and to identify and validate genetic
modulators of acute responses to high-dose THC (Aim 2). In Aim 1A we use a targeted proteomics approach
to quantify striatal CB1 levels in membrane-enriched protein fractions in parents, reciprocal F1, and BXD
strains. Differential expression in parental strains, allele-specific expression in the F1 and linkage mapping in
the BXDs will identify and validate QTLs containing trans-acting regulators of striatal CB1. In Aim 1B we
extend the analysis to two other regions and in Aim 1C we include exposure to high-dose THC. In Aim 2A we
screen a large panel (i.e., 80) of BXDs for differential CB1 activation quantified as hypolocomotion,
hypothermia, and antinociception following VEH or THC treatment and identify QTLs accounting for at least
30% of the variation in each trait at a target precision of ±2 Mb. In Aim 2B we generate matched proteomes
and transcriptomes for parental strains and F1 and generate transcriptome data for expression QTL (eQTL)
mapping in BXDs with the goal of facilitating the identification of causal QTGs. In Aim 2C we validate the
biological role of QTGs in cannabinoid receptor signaling pathways and responses to THC. This is the first
pharmacogenomic screen to identify variation in effectors of CB1 signaling and will reveal new targets
underlying responses to high-dose THC and behaviors associated with cannabis use in rodents and humans."
10831508,"CD5+ B-1a cells are innate-like B cells in mouse and man. They emerge during fetal/neonatal
development independent of the bone marrow (BM)-derived progenitors that later give rise to
follicular B-2 cells. In essence, we see B-1a and B-2 (follicular B cell) as having evolved
sequentially to create B cell layers that provide progressively more complex immune capabilities,
including, for B-1a, the induction of self-tolerance. Thus, we show here that 1) B-1a express high
levels of Aire, which promotes the expression/presentation of self-antigens by thymic APCs and
hence promotes the induction of T cell tolerance; 2) B-1a activation and Aire induction in neonatal
thymus depends on CD4+ T cell-mediated CD40 signaling, and requires T cells expressing a
special repertoire; 3) Partial ablation of Foxp3+ CD4+ regulatory T (Treg) cells in neonatal thymus
results in decreased numbers of thymic B-1a; and, reciprocally, 4) Depletion of thymic B-1a cells
during neonatal life decreases Treg generation. Together, these findings demonstrate that B-1a
cells interact with CD4+ thymocytes in neonatal thymus to generate cross talk that activates B-1a
cells to differentiate to Aire+IgMnegIgDnegCD5+ APCs; and, 5) these cells in turn participate in the
selection of neonatal Treg cells that play a key role in inducing/maintaining self-tolerance (21-23).
In earlier studies, we have shown that T cell tolerance to B cells is impaired in B cell-deficient
µMT mice, i.e., CD4+ T cells in µMT mice inhibit B cell reconstitution in adult µMT hosts. Most
significantly, we find that B-1a cells in neonatal µMT mice condition CD4+ T cells to enable
establishment of follicular B cells (24). Further, we find that Treg generation in neonatal µMT
mice is decreased and, most strikingly, that Treg cells from normal neonatal mice suppress the
inhibitory function of µMT CD4+ T cells, as these cells enable B cell reconstitution in µMT hosts
when co-transferred with BM whereases co-transfer of Treg cells from µMT mice fails to do so.
Taken together, these findings lead us to propose that B-1a cells play a key role in inducing T cell
tolerance to B cells in neonatal thymus, where the B-1a cells interact with CD4+ thymocytes,
internalize surface IgM, differentiate to Aire+IgMnegIgDnegCD5+ APCs, and then, select a population
of neonatal Treg cells that confer B cell-tolerance. Studies proposed here will test this hypothesis
and will clarify the B cell tolerance induction mechanism that is induced by B-1a and regulated by
Treg in neonatal thymus. Findings from this study will thus shed key light on the fundamental
mechanisms that governs the induction of neonatal immunological self-tolerance, and will offer
new insights into the autoimmune diseases to which Aire-mediated B-1a cell function contributes."
10821483,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and the second leading cause of cancer death in the United
States (US). Although women included in the US Census racial/ethnic categories Hispanic/Latina (H/L) and
Asian American/Pacific Islander (AA/PI) have relatively low breast cancer incidence compared to non-Hispanic
White (NHW) women, multiple studies have reported a higher proportion of human epidermal growth factor
receptor positive (HER2+) tumors in these groups (18-30%) compared to NHWs (14-18%). Expression of HER2
is clinically significant because it determines if a patient can receive targeted treatment. HER2+ disease,
independent of hormone receptor (HR) status, is also associated with poor outcome compared to the most
common HR+ HER2- subtype. The use of European-centric data to predict cancer risk and prognosis in non-
Europeans remains a critical barrier for equity in the implementation of precision medicine. Overall, there is a
gap in knowledge regarding the genetic factorsand molecular correlates relevant to the etiology of HER2+ breast
cancer in diverse populations. Supported by a) our previous work showing a consistent association between
Indigenous American ancestry and HER2+ subtypes in H/L breast cancer patients, b) the higher proportion of
HER2+ tumors described in AA/PI and Asian populations, c) the closer genetic distance between these
populations relative to European groups, and d) promising preliminary data, we hypothesize that germline
variants more common in Indigenous American and Asian genomes contribute to the higher risk of HER2
amplification/expression in breast tumors of individuals with these ancestries. To test this hypothesis, we propose
to integrate and leverage our own existing studies for a total of 17,049 cases (~4,200 HER2+) and 15,409
controls for discovery, and the NCI’s Confluence Project Data for replication (~600,000 cases and controls
combined). Our main goal is to discover germline genetic variants contributing to the higher incidence of HER2+
breast cancer in women of Latin American and Asian heritage. To achieve this goal, we will 1) identify germline
variation associated with HER2+ breast cancer in H/L and Asian women and replicate across diverse ancestries,
2) develop, validate, and test trans-ancestry and ancestry-specific polygenic risk scores for HER2+ disease, and
3) identify genes associated with HER2+ breast cancer risk in H/L and Asian women. The results of our study
will lead to the discovery of genetic factors contributing to the observed HER2 subtype-ancestry association in
women of Indigenous American and Asian ancestry for improved prediction, and provide a better understanding
of HER2+ tumor etiology, which could lead to improved precision prevention strategies and the development of
new targeted treatments for HER2+ disease."
10902031,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Liver cancer is estimated to afflict 42,230 individuals and result in approximately 30,230 deaths in the US in 2021.
The incidence rates for liver cancer have more than tripled since 1980, making it the 5th leading cause of cancer-
related deaths in the US. Approximately three-fourths of liver cancer cases are hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
As for all cancers, detection of HCC at an earlier stage is critical to elicit the best chance of a cure. Early detection
of HCC has significant potential to reduce mortality rates, due to the significant efficacy of local treatments for
early-stage disease vs. systemic therapy for advanced-stage cancers. Although surveillance of patients at high-
risk for HCC (e.g., those with chronic hepatitis or liver cirrhosis [LC]) is widely performed, the population of
patients with HCC without viral etiologies is increasing because of insufficient screening for HCC. At present,
alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is the most widely used blood tumor marker; and hepatic ultrasound is a low-cost imaging
method for surveillance of HCCs. However, both approaches have limited sensitivity and specificity for detecting
early-stage HCC, highlighting the imperative need to develop robust biomarkers for the early detection of HCC.
Accumulating evidence indicates that dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) occurs in all human cancers,
including HCC. As biomarkers, miRNAs are more resilient than mRNAs, and are frequently deregulated even in
the earliest stages of neoplasia. Furthermore, the recent discovery that cancers actively excrete small
extracellular vesicles, called exosomes, has brought additional enthusiasm to this burgeoning translational
research topic. While exosomes are considered to reflect their respective cells-of-origin, their use in biomarker
research has been hampered due to lack of standardized protocols for their isolation and purification, use of cell
line-derived, but not patient-derived specimens for biomarker discovery; and lack of biomarker discovery in
cancer-derived exosomes from matched tissues and plasma specimens. Furthermore, despite the perception
that exosomal-miRNAs (exo-miRNAs) may be superior to circulating cell-free miRNAs (cf-miRNAs), no studies
have undertaken an effort to directly compare these two types, to support or negate their superiority as disease
biomarkers. In this proposal, we will address these concerns by undertaking the following Specific Aims. Aim 1:
Discover candidate cf-miRNA and exo-miRNA biomarkers using small RNA-Seq in matched tissue and plasma
from patients with early-stage HCC vs. controls. Aim 2: Develop a biomarker panel composed of cf-miRNAs and
exo-miRNAs for the identification of patients with HCC in an independent cohort. Aim 3: Clinically validate the
optimized panel of non-invasive plasma miRNA biomarkers in a large prospective cohort of patients with HCC.
If successful, this proposal will provide molecular characterization of cell-free and exosomal miRNAs as liquid
biopsy biomarkers, which may allow early-detection of HCC using a non-invasive, and inexpensive assay."
10836535,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is the most common form of spinal cord (SC) injury in adults. DCM is
characterized by multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical spine, causing SC compression and injury,
which leads to worsening neurological dysfunction. Hand weakness and diminished coordination are more
severe spinal pathology indicators, increasing the likelihood of spinal surgery. While restoring hand function is
a primary goal of surgery, surgical management of DCM is challenging due to the low diagnostic certainty of
the underlying pathology and lack of predictive factors to determine which patients may improve with surgery.
The injury in DCM extends beyond the level of SC compression and affects the entire neuromuscular system.
The interplay among the brain, SC, and muscles needs to be characterized to fully understand the
mechanisms underlying hand dysfunction in DCM, the progression of DCM pathology, and the factors
promoting recovery. Here we will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to non-invasively characterize the
brain, SC, and muscular mechanisms underlying hand weakness and diminished coordination in DCM. We will
then combine brain, SC, and muscle measures to develop neuromuscular signatures of hand function and
assess their value in predicting surgical outcomes in DCM. Our overarching hypothesis is that signatures of
neuromuscular health will track the progression of DCM pathology and predict surgical recovery of hand
function (less extensive brain, SC, and muscle injury will predict better surgical outcome). To accomplish this,
we will enroll 60 right-handed DCM patients (age 40–80 years, 30 females, 30 males) with right hand
weakness and diminished coordination, who are scheduled for surgery, and 60 age- and sex-matched healthy
volunteers. We will perform simultaneous brain-SC fMRI using force-matching and finger-tapping tasks and
resting-state functional connectivity to characterize the brain and SC mechanisms underlying hand dysfunction.
We will also capture gray matter morphometry and white matter integrity along corticospinal pathways using
methods developed and in use by our team. Then we will perform fat-water and diffusion tensor MRI of the
right forearm providing measures of muscle volume and quality to characterize the downstream effects of SC
injury on the forearm muscles. We will use multivariate machine-learning algorithms and the brain, SC, and
muscle imaging to develop neuromuscular signatures of hand function by predicting grip strength and dexterity.
We will then track clinical outcomes at 1-year post-surgery in the DCM patients, and we will assess the value
of the pre-surgical signature responses for predicting surgical outcomes and establish clinical cutoffs. Validated
neurobiologically-based predictors of surgical response could lead to earlier intervention in those likely to
recover, prevent exposure to risks and complications in those unlikely to respond, and elucidate the factors
underlying recovery to improve treatment."
10889133,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Lipid droplets (LDs) are neutral lipid storage organelles that act as cellular hubs of lipid homeostasis.
Dysregulation in LD function has been implicated in prevalent metabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Indeed, the pathological hallmark of
NAFLD is the accumulation of large hepatic LDs. In addition to metabolic diseases, LDs have also been
implicated in cancer proliferation and survival, host-pathogen interactions, and neurodegeneration. Thus,
understanding how LDs are regulated has the potential to broadly impact our understanding of human health
and disease. LDs are ER-derived organelles that have a unique ultrastructure, consisting of a core of neutral
lipid surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer decorated with integral and peripheral proteins. While recent
findings have advanced our understanding of LD biogenesis, how LDs are regulated under different metabolic
conditions and how the composition of the LD proteome remain poorly understood. To overcome these critical
gaps in knowledge and define the mechanisms that regulate neutral lipid storage, we performed a series of
CRISPR-Cas9 screen in human cells using a fluorescence-based neutral lipid reporter under different metabolic
conditions. We also employed genetic screens to examine the mechanisms that regulate PLIN2, a near
ubiquitous Class II LD protein that plays important roles in regulating LD stability. Our findings establish a
compendium of neutral lipid storage regulators, revealing interesting novel regulators that are condition specific.
Furthermore, we identify several ubiquitination factors that influence neutral lipid storage and the stability of
PLIN2. The current proposal aims to build on the foundation provided by our extensive preliminary data to
characterize new mechanisms of LD regulation. In aim 1, we will complete our validation experiments to establish
an extensive, phenotypic-rich resource for the community that is hypothesis generating. We will also examine
the concept that metabolic state-dependent regulation of LDs is a significant contributor to cellular lipid
homeostasis. Finally, we will characterize high priority candidates in iPSC-derived hepatocytes and examine the
hypothesis that a subset of regulators governs LD stability as part of a host response to pathogens. In Aim 2, we
will define the role of new ubiquitination pathways in regulating lipid homeostasis, examining the hypothesis that
the identified factors regulate LD stability by controlling the degradation of PLIN2 during lipolysis. These findings
will provide new global and mechanistic insights in to LD proteome remodeling and regulation under different
metabolic conditions."

In the fetal brain, cortical plate (CP) thickness is thought to be related to the number and size of cells within a
column, packing density, intracortical myelin, and synapses, and subplate (SP) thickness associated with the
number of thalamic and cortical afferents and the amount of cortico-cortical connections. Estimation of cortical
thickness postnatally with MRI has contributed greatly to our understanding of human brain development and
cognitive function and disease onset and progression in various brain disorders. However, our knowledge and
research of human in utero CP and SP thickness remains limited due to the lack of available techniques that
automatically measure regional CP and SP thickness from fetal brain MRI. Compared to child or adult brains,
fetal brains are much smaller in size and have different image contrast. Fetal brain MRI shows lower effective
resolution and suffers from head motion which causes artifacts. Thus, it is challenging to extract accurate CP
and SP regions and define geometrically appropriate thickness between the CP and SP surfaces. This study
will develop a fully automatic pipeline to extract regional CP and SP thickness using multi-site fetal MRI
datasets. We will develop the method for CP and SP segmentation with the identification of sulcal
cerebrospinal fluid regions using deep convolutional neural networks. Based on the accurate segmentation, a
deformable model method that is optimized and specialized for fetal brains will be developed to extract the CP
and SP surfaces. CP and SP thickness will be measured based on vertex-wise correspondence between all
CP and SP surfaces. We will perform reliability and sensitivity tests using different imaging subsets within the
same subject and artificial data created by moving the CP and SP boundary. We will then define the growth
rate of CP and SP thickness in all cortical regions in typically developing (TD) fetuses from 18 to 37 gestational
weeks (GW). We hypothesize that the growth rate of CP and SP thickness, the maximum SP thickness, and/or
the maximum growth GW of CP thickness will be variable across different cortical areas in TD fetuses. The
growth of CP and SP thickness in fetuses with cerebral abnormalities (polymicrogyria and agenesis of corpus
callosum) will be statistically compared to the growth of TD fetuses. Malformations of cortical development and
cortico-cortical connections may result in altered growth of CP and SP thickness in fetuses with polymicrogyria
and agenesis of corpus callosum. This study will lay the foundation for a novel biomarker that can lead to
greater insight into the mechanisms of normal and altered in utero brain development. Our methods developed
from the proposed study will be publicly distributed using a web-based neuroimage computation platform,
which will enable more clinical applications of fetal CP and SP thickness analysis."

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) accounts for 6-8% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs). While substantial
therapeutic advances have been achieved for other NHLs, MCL remains an incurable lymphoma, the reason of
which is not known. MCL patients have a dismal prognosis with a median overall survival of 3-5 years.
Standard of care includes ibrutinib, a small molecule inhibitor of the B-cell receptor (BCR)-proximal tyrosine
kinase BTK. However, one-third of MCL patients do not respond to the drug. Even initially ibrutinib-
sensitive patients invariably develop resistance; however, the mechanisms of ibrutinib-resistance are now
clear. Since mechanistic insight into oncogenic BCR signaling in DLBCL and CLL enabled the development of
highly effective treatment approaches, this proposal will address the mechanisms of oncogenic BCR-
signaling in MCL. In an integrated functional analysis combining a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 library, gene
expression profiling and BCR signal transduction studies, we have uncovered CEACAM1 as a central
component of oncogenic BCR signaling that is essential in MCL but not in normal B cells or other B-cell
malignancies. As a transmembrane protein, CEACAM1 is expressed on the surface of activated lymphocytes
and carries two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) on its cytoplasmic tail. Owing to
recruitment of the inhibitory phosphatase SHP1 to the ITIMs, CEACAM1 functions as a regulator of T-cell
receptor (TCR) signaling in T cells, however, its function in normal B cells and MCL is not known.
Unexpectedly, our preliminary data showed that CEACAM1 function induced a net increase of BCR signaling,
leading to increased survival and proliferation of MCL cells in vitro and in vivo. Our mechanistic studies
revealed that CEACAM1 recruited the actin-binding protein filamin A to the plasma membrane
microdomains and activated the BCR-proximal kinase LYN after antigen engagement. Furthermore, super-
resolution confocal microscopy revealed that CEACAM1 promoted reorganization of the actin cytoskeletal
network following BCR cross-linking. Leveraging the clinical grade Cell Therapeutics Facility at City of Hope,
we designed and validated a novel CEACAM1 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) engineered in primary
human T cells. The CAR-T cells were highly active in eliminating CEACAM1+ MCL but lacked reactivity against
other cell types. Based on our discovery of CEACAM1 as a critical BCR signaling component in MCL and the
successful development of CEACAM1 CAR-T cells, we hypothesize that CEACAM1 functions as a
central driver of oncogenic BCR activity and represents a novel therapeutic target in MCL. The following
specific aims will test and refine the concept of CEACAM1-based therapies for MCL: Aim 1) Define the
mechanistic role of CEACAM1 in oncogenic BCR signaling in MCL; Aim 2) Dissect the role of CEACAM1 in
new genetic mouse models for MCL; Aim 3) Validation of CAR T-cell strategies targeting CEACAM1 in
refractory MCL. Results from the proposed studies are expected to provide: 1) new information on the central
role of CEACAM1 in oncogenic BCR signaling and MCL, and 2) pre-clinical validation of novel
immunotherapeutic strategies targeting CEACAM1 in refractory MCL."
10892671,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
The goal of the proposed research is to use proteomics on samples from patient-derived cells with defined
disease genotypes to identify the disrupted molecular pathways that underpin phenotypes of autism spectrum
disorder (ASD). Family history and twin studies suggest that, in at least some cases, these disorders share
genetic roots, but the degree to which environmental and genetic factors account for individual differences within
the spectrum is currently unknown. The possibility that there is a genetic antecedent to the onset of ASD
stimulated GWAS studies, but these studies were only able to identify genetic risk factors and not specific
causative genes. To gain an understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms associated with ASD, we
will use human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) from patients with diseases on the autism spectrum. We
have been reprogrammed fibroblasts from these patients and differentiated them into cells to create organoids,
thus allowing the proteomic study in human diseases that were previously unobtainable (e.g. brain diseases). In
this study, we will use large-scale proteomics combined with single cell proteomics to identify protein changes
in individual cells of two genotypes on the autism spectrum. Patients suffering from the monogenetic disease
Rett Syndrome (RTT) exhibit clinical phenotypes that mirror elements of ASD. We have fibroblasts that contain
the different mutations in the gene MECP2 that cause RTT. We also have cells that contain the copy number
variant CNV 16p11.2, a genetic variant on the autism spectrum. The molecular changes underpinning the
development of ASD are poorly understood, but patient-derived cerebral organoids recapitulate molecular and
morphological changes by gene dosage changes from CNV 16p11.2. We propose to use powerful mass
spectrometry multiplexing technologies (Tandem Mass Tags – TMT) to measure commonalities and differences
in proteome and phosphoproteome encoded by these genotypes. In addition, electrophysiology measurements
will be combined with single cell proteomics to measure protein changes in neurons with electrophysiology
disrupted by these genetic changes."
10837095,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Racial disparities in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are apparent and
pervasive. However, the mechanisms and moderators are understudied. These disparities may, in
part, be due to racial differences in available neighborhood resources such as parks and senior
centers. The presence of these resources may contribute to brain and cognitive health in older
adulthood. Furthermore, the impact of living in an under-resourced neighborhood may be buffered by
individuals' social networks. This study's overall goal is to clarify risk and resilience mechanisms
underlying race disparities in ADRD by: 1) Determining whether racial differences in neighborhood
resources contribute to racial disparities in cognitive function; 2) Examining the moderating role of
social networks in the association between neighborhood resources and cognition; 3) Characterizing
the role of brain integrity in associations between neighborhood resources and cognition. The
research plan will leverage primary data collection efforts of the Michigan Cognitive Aging Project,
which is a regionally-representative cohort study of older adults in Southeastern Michigan.
 This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award application will also facilitate the
training and professional development of a junior scientist with existing expertise in direct clinical care
to accelerate the applicant's trajectory towards ADRD research independence. The applicant will be
supported by a strong mentorship team with primary mentors at the University of Michigan's Institute
for Social Research and Department of Psychology. Together, the mentorship and advisory team will
provide expertise in cognitive aging, neuroimaging, ADRD race disparities, and social networks. The
training plan will help: a) expand the applicant's substantive knowledge of the built environment,
social networks, and the neuroanatomy underlying cognitive aging; b) improve the applicant's
statistical methodological skills, particularly those pertaining to geospatial analysis, causal inference,
latent variable modeling, pooling datasets, and operationalizing cognitive reserve/resilience; c)
develop the applicant's expertise in the recruitment and retention of older racial and ethnic minority
participants in longitudinal research; and d) enhance the applicant's grant writing skills.
 The proposed research directly addresses Goals D and F of the NIA Strategic Directions for
Research on Aging, which calls for more research on 1) contexts influencing mechanisms underlying
cognitive and brain aging and 2) understanding health disparities among older adults. Our findings
will have the potential to contextualize individual differences in ADRDs to inform interventions to
mitigate persistent racial inequalities in ADRDs."
10911307,"HER2 is an oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). It is overexpressed in about 20% breast cancer (BC)
due to gene amplification, known as HER2-positive BC (HER2+ BC). Several HER2 inhibitors are available
clinically and have significantly improved disease outcome. However, primary and acquired drug resistance
is common. Most patients with advanced disease show disease progression after some time on treatment.
Drug resistance is a major unresolved problem in HER2+ BC, and our long-term goal is to find a solution to
this problem. In this project, we propose to investigate a recombinant human protein, i.e., PEPDG278D, for
overcoming drug resistance in HER2+ BC. PEPDG278D is an enzymatically inactive mutant of peptidase D
(also known as prolidase). Exogenously-administered PEPDG278D binds to HER2 and its family member
EGFR, and in cancer cells overexpressing the RTKs, PEPDG278D disrupts their signaling units, directs them
for lysosomal degradation, and inhibits the growth of the cells in vitro and in vivo. PEPDG278D inhibits HER2+
BC cells that are resistant to current HER2 inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. Yet, PEPDG278D is well tolerated in
mouse studies and shows little effect on HER2 and EGFR in normal tissues where expression of the RTKs
is very low. Cancer cells lacking HER2 and EGFR are insensitive to PEPDG278D as well. The objectives of
this proposal are: 1) to determine the therapeutic activity and mechanism of action of PEPDG278D in HER2+
BC, and 2) to assess PEPDG278D safety and to understand how PEPDG278D spares HER2 and EGFR in
normal cells. The central hypothesis is that PEPDG278D targets HER2 and EGFR specifically and its unique
binding mode enables it to target overexpressed HER2 and EGFR strongly and selectively, thereby
inhibiting drug-resistant HER2+ BC without causing toxicity. The rationale for the proposal is that completion
of the research may propel PEPDG278D into clinical evaluation. We propose three specific aims to test the
hypothesis: 1) to elucidate the target specificity of PEPDG278D, 2) to assess its therapeutic activity and
mechanism of action, and 3) to determine its target selectivity and how it spares HER2 and EGFR in normal
cells. An innovative combination of experimental methods will be used, including but not limited to isogenic
cells, cells and tumors carrying clinically verified molecular changes that confer resistance to current HER2
inhibitors, primary normal human cells and humanized mice. The proposed research is significant, because
it addresses a major problem in HER2+ BC, i.e., drug resistance. Expected outcome of this work includes:
1) showing that HER2 and EGFR are the sole therapeutic targets of PEPDG278D; 2) showing that PEPDG278D
inhibits HER2+ BC resistant to current HER2 inhibitors and the underlying mechanisms; 3) showing that
HER2 remains a critical therapeutic target in drug-resistant HER2+ BC; and 4) showing that PEPDG278D is
non-toxic to normal cells and tissues and understanding the molecular basis. Our findings will have an
important positive impact, because they will generate strong enthusiasm for clinical study of PEPDG278D."

A large body of literature now indicates that antenatal and neonatal antibiotic exposure is associated with adverse
childhood outcomes due to disruption of the developing microbiome. In premature infants, the standard of care
for many decades has included the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics in the first hours of life as
treatment for a presumptive diagnosis of early onset sepsis. However, nearly all preterm infants receiving these
antibiotics do not actually have sepsis. This grant renewal application proposes an ancillary microbiome study
linked to the NANO (NICU Antibiotics and Outcomes) Trial, a recently launched clinical trial that will challenge
this longstanding practice of immediately prescribing antibiotics to newborn preterm infants. NANO will test the
hypothesis that antibiotics at birth worsens outcomes in preterm infants that are clinically stable. This multicenter
trial, which is led by members of our research team, will randomize 802 premature infants to receive intravenous
ampicillin and gentamicin or a saline placebo control. The study will measure the impact of variables including
mode of delivery, gestational age, sex, and receipt of maternal milk, and administration of maternal antepartum
antibiotics.
Infant fecal samples in the first month of life as well as maternal fecal and vaginal swabs will be collected in
NANO for basic microbiome profiling in the antibiotics and placebo groups using 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
Here, we propose to augment microbiome analyses of NANO study subjects using novel strain-level
metagenomic strategies and by analyzing samples beyond the first month of life. With this strategy, we propose
to Aim 1. Test the hypothesis that empiric antibiotics (EA) disrupts mother-infant strain sharing in preterm infants.
Aim 2. Test the hypothesis that EA increases the abundance of gut bacterial antimicrobial resistance genes in
preterm infants. Aim 3. Test the hypothesis that EA delays the transition from a gut ecosystem dominated by
facultative anaerobes to one dominated by obligate anaerobes. Because NANO is a first-of-its-kind clinical trial
evaluating antibiotic therapy during the first days of life, this ancillary study will provide a rare opportunity to ask
and answer a unique set of questions about the biology of early gut bacterial colonization."

Over the past several decades, dramatic breakthroughs in biomedical science have been witnessed within
laboratory research. The ability to translate those discoveries as well as to make new discoveries within human
investigations has been a challenge and has been often characterized as the bottleneck of clinical research.
Added to this context has been the dramatic changes to healthcare organizational environments, constraints on
delivery, efficiency, and reimbursements to include major structural changes to the investment in healthcare
research, both federally, and industrially. Lastly, as a result of dramatic systemic changes in healthcare funding
structure, the impact on higher educational graduates' careers, specifically doctoral graduates, has been quite
profound. Within that changing dynamic landscape, we hypothesize that the fundamental bottlenecks associated
with clinical translational research can be dramatically loosened with the training of engineers intimately familiar
with human treatment and trained in the inception of novel technology-based platforms. We further hypothesize
that continued scientific discoveries within the human environment as well as novel treatment approaches are
highly dependent on these technology-based platforms. The purpose of this training program is to create a new
cadre of researchers capable of creating, developing, implementing, clinically evaluating, and translating
methods, devices, algorithms, and systems designed with a clear focus at one particular application of medicine,
namely, to facilitate surgical/interventional processes and their outcomes. Thematically, our trainees and training
program will have a central focus – innovative platform technologies for treatment and discovery. While this
training program addresses pressing problems in biomedical research, namely the translation and facilitation of
human investigative systems, the program also speaks to improving higher education career trajectories by
providing a novel professional development atmosphere. Briefly described, the training program is a year 2, 3
program that centers on a novel dual-course clinical immersion sequence (a first course that is a context heavy
experience with physicians introducing their specialty and clinical realities, and a second course that is an
intensively immersive environment with students embedded within the clinical team). In both courses, students
are required to engage in expository writing associated with disease and therapeutic analysis, provocative
question solutions, clinical outcome analysis and reviews, and mock grant applications. This framework supports
a unique educational paradigm brought to engineering education. Apart from this sequence, training continues
with addition course work among areas associated with surgical/interventional guidance and delivery,
interventional imaging, medical image processing and analysis, robotics and medical device design, modeling &
simulation, interventional therapeutics, and new to this cycle, interventional and surgical data science. This all
takes place in one of the most strategically collocated environments for engineering, surgery, and intervention
in the world. This is a Training Program for Innovative Engineering Research in Surgery and Intervention."
10880350,"ABSTRACT
It is our ultimate goal to define the molecular basis for EBV-mediated metabolic control critical for B-cell
tumorigenesis. In this proposal, we will focus on how EBV promotes the balanced upregulation of oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis supporting B-cell immortalization and tumorigenesis. It is our central
hypothesis that the viral latent transcription factor, EBNA-LP, functions as a mimic of the OXPHOS transcriptional
co-activator PGC-1 while glycolysis and redox balance are maintained through viral upregulation of the lactate
transporters MCT1 and 4. We have formulated our central hypothesis based on preliminary data including
orthogonal approaches that define interactions between EBNA-LP and OXPHOS transcription factors, define a
new post-translational modification on EBNA-LP, and characterize the metabolic consequences of suppressing
viral-mediated lactate export. We found that the viral EBNA-LP protein associates with NRF-1, ERR, and YY-
1 mimicking the cellular co-activator PGC-1. We describe a novel post-translational modification of EBNA-LP,
hydroxyprolination, that we propose is critical for higher order complex formation enabling transcriptional
activation. Balanced with an increase in OXPHOS promoted by EBNA-LP, the upregulation of glycolytic enzymes
by EBNA2 and c-MYC leads to an accumulation of lactate in cells that must be exported to sustain B-cell
proliferation. We found that cellular monocarboxylate transporters, MCT1 and MCT4, are temporally regulated
by EBV to sustain B-cell proliferation through maintaining NAD+/NADH ratios and glutathione levels to counter
the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Therefore, the rationale for this proposed research is that
understanding how EBV regulates cellular metabolism during B-cell immortalization could reveal novel
therapeutic modalities to target EBV-infected B-cell lymphomas. We plan to test our central hypothesis and
complete the objectives in this proposal through the following two specific aims: i) to determine the molecular
mechanism by which EBNA-LP coordinates EBV-regulated oxidative phosphorylation to immortalize naïve B
cells and ii) to define the viral-mediated mechanism for temporal regulation of the monocarboxylate transporters,
MCT1 and 4, through B-cell outgrowth and the consequences of their antagonism."

Forty percent of patients with the most prevalent luminal hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer (BCa)
subtype are unresponsive to conventional endocrine therapy (ET) and readily present with incurable metastatic
disease. Patients with ET resistant (ET-R) BCa exhibit an “endocrine-switch” to androgen receptor (AR)-
dependent tumor growth and metastasis. Anti-androgens are emerging as promising therapy for other
advanced BCa subtypes but surprisingly, AR overexpressing ET-R BCa cells are unresponsive to AR
antagonists. Our new findings show constitutively active AR accumulate and evade the inhibitory actions of
anti-androgen Enzalutamide (Enz). Hence, the objective of the current project is to design a therapeutic
strategy to effectively target AR and prevent metastatic progression of ET-R BCa.
We demonstrate that unlike other cancer models, persistent SUMO post-translational modification (PTM) of AR
(SUMO-AR) occurs natively in acquired and intrinsic ET-R BCa cells. SUMO-PTM is a critical dynamic cellular
process and an imbalance in SUMO-specific enzymes drive select types of BCa including basal and Myc-
dependent BCa as reported by us and others. Independent of the established SUMO enzymatic system, we
identify a dual SUMO-ubiquitin ligase that is druggable and destabilizes SUMO-AR in ET-R BCa. This proposal
will delineate the regulatory control of this novel ligase in ET-R BCa and its role in Enz-response. Our new data
suggests that constitutive SUMO-AR genomic activity requires interaction with a lncRNA. Hence, we will
delineate how SUMO-AR/lncRNA interaction facilitates ligand-independent genomic activity in ET-R BCa cells.
Finally, the proposed studies will test unique approaches to either 1) inhibit AR activity or 2) potentiate AR
degradation versus the current standard Enz. In the process, we will generate novel therapeutics and evaluate
clinically relevant compounds specifically for advanced ET-R BCa.
Consistently, completion of the project will validate the need and establish the tools for more comprehensive
translational studies on SUMO-AR in ET-R HR+ BCa."

Targeted cancer therapy, in the form of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, has been a game changer for patients with
cancers driven by activating mutations in genes encoding these proteins. Yet, while we are seeing overall survival
beneﬁts unlike with any new agents in over a decade, cures remain elusive, or non-existent, as resistance to
these agents reliably emerges. The process driving this resistance is the same process that drives invasive
pests' resistance to pesticides, pathogens' resistance to antibiotics and many other phenomena in life: Darwinian
evolution. While this is being increasingly recognized, it has yet to change the paradigm in cancer research where
most projects are centered on a hunt for actionable mutations conferring resistance. While these secondary
mutations are often druggable themselves, we submit that this is a never-ending race that evolution will always

directly measure the eco-evolutionary interactions driving the emergence of resistance in vitro. This assay allows
us to directly parameterize an evolutionary game theoretic model with empiric studies in any system. Here, we

My work aims to uncover non-genetic mechanisms that drive cancer cell plasticity. I focus specifically on Ewing
Sarcoma, a pediatric cancer driven by a single oncogenic fusion, making it prototypical for cancers whose
disease progression likely depends on non-genetic adaptations. During my postdoc thus far, I have developed
two complimentary models to study heterogeneity of cell states in Ewing Sarcoma: (1) a quantitative high-
resolution imaging assay that uses computer-vision based classification of single cell states within Ewing
Sarcoma xenografts in zebrafish, and (2) a bimodal distribution of cell signaling states characterized by
differential expression and organization of the scaffolding protein Caveolin-1. While the precise role of Caveolin-
1 in cancer remains controversial, recent works suggest that mechanical cues trigger changes in its localization
and activity, implicating Caveolin-1 as a potential integrator of environmental cues and cell signaling. However,
the mechanism of response and the ensuing signaling cascades remain to be understood, especially in the
context of cancer. Therefore, I will leverage the unique experimental frameworks I have established to test
whether Cav-1 acts as a plasticity factor promoting tumor cell adaptation in Ewing Sarcoma. This work will reveal
mechanisms of fast cellular adaptation to diverse microenvironmental cues which will provide unique insight into
the drivers of metastasis and drug resistance.
I am eager to build upon the foundations I have established during my postdoc thus far to discover previously
unapproachable mechanisms of cell adaptation. As the proposed work requires cross-disciplinary expertise, my
continued development in several areas will be instrumental to my progress. Dr. Danuser and the Danuser lab
will provide the ideal environment to develop advanced microscopy techniques and skills in computational
analysis of 3D data. Dr. Amatruda will provide guidance and support in the use of zebrafish disease models and
relevance to pediatric cancer. Dr. Lamaze and Dr. Cobb will provide scientific insight in caveolar biology, MAPK
cell signaling, and cancer biology. Combined with the stellar training environment and resources available at UT
Southwestern, this provides the ideal environment to carry out this work. The training I will receive will enable
me to lead an independent laboratory that studies cancer cell plasticity in a variety of experimental models, with
specific focus on imaging-based approaches and physiologically relevant environments."
10854779,"Restoring employment is an important rehabilitation goal for Veterans with spinal cord injury (SCI)
because employment impacts both quality of life (QOL) and longevity. Due to the medical complexity
of SCI, however, these Veterans face unique employment barriers that are not adequately addressed
by current Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) vocational services. Vocational services for Veterans
with SCI need to address these employment barriers, which relate to physical health, finances, time
for job search, and caregiver issues. Customized employment (CE), an innovative strategy for
tailoring vocational services to meet individual needs of people with complex disabilities, could be
adapted for use in SCI rehabilitation. This research will evaluate a CE intervention to help Veterans
with SCI discover their strengths, customize employment plans, and find competitive integrated
employment in their communities. The proposed intervention, Achieving Competitive Customized
Employment through Specialized Services (ACCESS), is a user-driven, standardized CE program
delivered by a trained employment specialist and is effective for a non-clinical, community-based
population of adults with disabilities. This research is needed to test ACCESS as a complement to
clinical services for a clinically defined population and to assess the potential of CE for subsequent
implementation in the VA.
 This proposal is responsive to Veterans’ reported desire for individualized vocational rehabilitation
services and to the Modernization Plan and the MISSION Act, which emphasize Veteran-centered,
community-based approaches to care. The proposal goals align with the Transformation Plan of the
Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, which prioritizes evidence-informed, community-
based employment services. Recognizing the rapid adoption of CE in state and federal agencies, VA
is partnering with the Office of Disability and Employment Policy (Department of Labor) to introduce
and train VA vocational staff on CE as a promising practice; however, integration of CE into standard
VA clinical services has not yet been implemented. In support of VA efforts to assist Veterans to
achieve competitive employment and reintegration into civilian life, this proposal will evaluate CE
within the context of existing VA vocational services.
 The purpose of the proposal is to evaluate the impact of a CE intervention for Veterans with SCI
(ACCESS-Vets) on employment outcomes. The short-term goal is to determine effectiveness of
ACCESS-Vets for Veterans with SCI. The long-term goal is to guide research on and adoption of CE
as part of evidence-informed vocational services in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to
improve employment outcomes for Veterans with SCI. The proposed 4-year, mixed-methods, multi-
site, randomized clinical trial will test the ACCESS-Vets intervention in a sample of Veterans with SCI
who have received or are currently receiving Individual Placement and Support (IPS) services
(treatment as usual). The specific aims are: (Aim 1) Determine the effectiveness of ACCESS-Vets in
a VHA clinical setting. (Aim 2) Examine the impact of employment on QOL and participation. (Aim 3)
Identify strategies used in IPS and ACCESS-Vets for addressing barriers to employment. The sample
will consist of Veterans (N = 100) and practitioners (N = 20) at VA facilities in Tampa, Florida, and
Richmond, Virginia. Aim 1 and 2 data collection will include assessments of employment,
psychological, and social outcomes. Aim 2 and 3 data collection will include telephone interviews of
Veteran participants and their providers to examine experiences using and adapting interventions to
address employment barriers."
10874737,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
More than one million infants are exposed to HIV each year in high-burden sub-Saharan African countries. Yet
only 60% of HIV-exposed infants are tested as recommended by two months of age. The key barriers to infant
HIV testing – stigma/non-disclosure, lack of access and poor social support – may be more effectively
overcome through interventions that engage women's social networks, the patterns of relationships women
have with family, peers, and other community members. Social networks make salient contextual norms and
enable peer learning, social support, and social engagement, all of which can affect health behaviors. There
remains a scientific gap in applying social network analysis to infant HIV testing. Until this gap is addressed,
there will also remain an implementation knowledge gap on how to design interventions that engage social
networks to prompt infant HIV testing. The central hypothesis of this proposed grant is that social networks can
influence women's decisions to test their infants for HIV. The primary objective of this K01 application is to
understand how women's individual- and social network-level characteristics affect infant HIV testing to design
and assess the feasibility of a social network intervention to improve infant HIV testing. The approach
leverages the infrastructure from an ongoing longitudinal study (R01MH113494, PI: Tsai) with complete social
network data from all adults living in 8 villages of Mbarara, Uganda and extends new primary data collection to
all HIV-positive, reproductive-age women and their children born during the study period. The grant will
achieve the following specific aims: 1) estimate individual- and social-network level correlates of infant testing
through social network analysis exploring the roles of peer influence, social norms, social support and social
engagement; 2) conduct in-depth qualitative interviews among women and integrate findings with quantitative
data to understand how social network mechanisms affect infant testing and develop a conceptual framework
of infant testing; 3) design and assess feasibility, acceptability, fidelity, reach and preliminary effectiveness of a
social network intervention to prompt infant HIV testing. My long-term goal is to become an independent
researcher with expertise in developing social network interventions to enhance HIV treatment and prevention
among women and children in sub-Saharan Africa. This K01 proposal will supplement my prior training and
experience with additional training and mentorship from a team of senior researchers with expertise in social
networks, qualitative and mixed methods, and implementation science applied to the context of HIV. I will
obtain integrated training, mentorship, and preliminary data for an R01 proposal to empirically test a novel
intervention to overcome the public health problem of low infant HIV testing. The key innovation of this
proposed study is that it is one of the first to apply social network theory and analysis to infant HIV testing. This
contribution will have significant public health impact by increasing uptake of HIV testing for the nearly one half
million exposed/undiagnosed infants in sub-Saharan Africa who are not tested by two months of age."

Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) threatens our goal of ending the global TB epidemic by 2035.
Early diagnosis of drug-resistant TB for timely initiation of appropriate treatment remains a
challenge. Phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) requires Mycobacterium tuberculosis
(MTB) culture and takes 8-12 weeks. Molecular-based methods are rapid but require previously
identified and validated resistance-conferring mutations. Unfortunately, mutations are not
completely known for key drugs included in newer all-oral regimens. Our long-term goal is to
develop a non-culture-based method for phenotypic DST that provides results in 48-72
hours from sputum collection and that can be used directly on sputum. Our innovative
approach is based on MPT64, a protein secreted only during active growth that is highly specific
for MTB. We demonstrated that MPT64 secretion in MTB cultures decreases significantly within
48–72 hours of anti-TB drug exposure for drug-susceptible but not drug-resistant MTB isolates.
We have previously measured MPT64 directly in sputum samples with a limit of detection
comparable with Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). In this study we will
validate culture MPT64 DST chemiluminescence-enzyme immunoassay (CLEA) for isoniazid
(INH), rifampin (RIF), fluoroquinolones (FQs), bedaquiline (BDQ), linezolid (LZD), and delamanid
(DLM). Our proposed approach will provide results within 72 hours of the time the culture is
identified as MTB, compared to the 2-3 weeks required to obtain results from conventional DST
(Aim 1). We will use the principles of culture MPT64 DST to develop a sputum MPT64 DST
CLEIA, which will provide results in 48-72 hours from the time of sputum collection. We will identify
protocols for sputum liquefaction, antibiotic exposure times, and CLEIA that result in the lowest
limit of detection (LOD) for resistant MTB cells (Aim 2). We will prospectively evaluate sputum
MPT64 DST in 860 patients with TB in the Philippines and in the country of Georgia (Aim 3). We
hypothesize that both culture MPT64 DST and sputum MPT64 DST will meet or exceed minimum
sensitivity (>95%) and specificity (>98%), which are the WHO high priority target product profiles
for rapid DST. The innovative MPT64 DST assays will transform TB management by enabling
early initiation of effective treatment based on rapid drug susceptibility data, thus improving patient
outcomes and curtailing the spread of drug resistant TB that is critical if TB is to be eliminated by
2035."
11027406,"This submission comprises two applications (Clinical and Statistical Data Coordinating Centers). We propose
to conduct a large (N=1,100), simple, pragmatic, superiority trial in the US - IMPROVE-AD – comparing a
strategy of medical therapy (MT) plus upfront thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) to MT plus
surveillance for deterioration in patients with uncomplicated type B aortic dissection (uTBAD). Surveillance will
include clinically indicated TEVAR and/or open repair performed for deterioration during index hospitalization
or follow up. This is the first trial of this size designed to establish guidance on uTBAD management. The trial
leadership is comprised of an experienced group of investigators in a Clinical Coordination Center (CCC; Duke
Clinical Research Institute, Durham, NC, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, and University of
Washington, Seattle, WA) a Statistical and Data Coordination Center (SDCC; Duke Clinical Research Institute,
Durham, NC) and a diverse, Executive and Steering Committee of experts in the field representing clinicians,
trialists, and patient advocates. Aortic dissection (AD) is the most common fatal event involving the aorta
occurring in 5 to 30 cases per million of population resulting in 12,000 deaths in the US annually. Type B aortic
dissections involve the entire descending aorta. Based on evidence from the 1960s, the main strategy for
uTBAD is medical therapy with lifelong surveillance. This strategy has been shown to have poor long-term
outcome in 25-50% of patients (aortic related events). The emergence of TEVAR as a less invasive alternative
to open repair, however, has resulted in debate over the use of upfront TEVAR to treat uTBAD. A pilot
European trial (INSTEAD) compared the outcomes of upfront TEVAR to optimal medical therapy in 140
patients with uTBAD. Despite being significantly underpowered for all-cause mortality, the findings, along with
observational data suggest that medical therapy plus upfront TEVAR may be associated with decreased all-
cause and aortic-related mortality. We have also demonstrated from our completed surveys that there is
equipoise among practitioners with respect to the most appropriate treatment strategy in uTBAD. We propose
a pragmatic trial with centralized, telephone follow-up, remote blood pressure monitoring, a clinically relevant
hierarchical primary endpoint (mortality / aortic-related hospitalization), and multi-disciplinary teams of
investigators and patient advocates. The trial duration is 84 months with 5-month start-up. Average follow-up
is 4 year with a minimum of 2.5 years and maximum of 6 years for individuals enrolled early. IMPROVE-AD will
have 88% power to detect a 25% relative reduction in the incidence of the primary endpoint for patients
randomized to upfront MT plus TEVAR compared to MT plus surveillance for deterioration, assuming a 5 year
cumulative incidence of 20% death and 20% aortic-related hospitalization in the MT plus surveillance for
deterioration arm."
10875576,"Project Summary/Abstract
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow are responsible for the regulated production of about ten
billion blood cells per day. Inflammation plays a key role in HSC function, promoting increased production of
immune cells during conditions of stress or infection. However, Dr. King’s prior work has shown that prolonged
exposure to interferon gamma, induced during chronic mycobacterial infections, alters HSC self-renewal and
differentiation, ultimately leading to HSC depletion and pancytopenia. This discovery spawned an explosion in
research into the connections between inflammation and primitive hematopoiesis and the role of inflammation
in bone marrow failure syndromes, hematologic malignancies, and age-associated impaired immunity. Despite
its disease relevance, fundamental questions remain about the mechanisms by which inflammation releases
HSCs from quiescence and promotes differentiation, and the hematologic and immunologic consequences of
these changes. The proposed research program builds upon the PI’s productive research track record to
delineate the molecular, transcriptional, and epigenetic mechanisms by which inflammation regulates primitive
hematopoiesis. Dr. King has identified key molecular mediators of inflammation-induced HSC differentiation
including the transcription factor Batf2 and the cell surface adhesin Bst2, highlighting how both cell intrinsic
transcriptional changes and cell extrinsic alterations in cell-cell interactions contribute to altered HSC activity
upon inflammation. Furthermore, Dr. King has extrapolated this work to show how a mutation in the epigenetic
modifier Dnmt3a impairs inflammation-induced differentiation of HSCs and thereby contributes to clonal
hematopoiesis, a widespread phenomenon linked to heart disease, stroke, and increased mortality in the
elderly. Building on this groundbreaking work, the proposed research program is divided into three projects.
The first project will delineate the mechanism of action of Batf2 and Bst2 in inflammation-mediated HSC
differentiation. These mechanistic studies will provide potential therapeutic targets to preserve HSC function in
the setting of chronic inflammation. The second project will quantify the impact of HSC differentiation on clonal
competition in order to provide critical insight into infection and inflammation as an environmental contributor to
clonal hematopoiesis, which is a risk factor for leukemia and cardiovascular disease. Finally, the third project
will ascertain the importance of inflammation-induced transcription and epigenetic changes in HSCs to
immunity. These studies will elucidate how inflammatory regulation of HSCs contributes to formation and
function of immune effector cells. Collectively, the proposed research program defines the impact of
inflammatory cytokine signaling on HSCs, their longevity, and their ability to maintain a healthy blood and
immune system over time. The long-term goal of these studies is to provide physiologic knowledge that will
lead to new strategies to protect and enhance bone marrow function for patients with bone marrow failure,
cancer, stem cell transplant, and chronic inflammatory conditions, as well as for the aging population at large."

HIV cure research is a high-priority for the National Institutes of Health and is targeting a strategy that can lead
to sustained antiretroviral treatment (ART)-free suppression. However, because there are no clear biomarkers
for an HIV cure – unlike CD4+ count and viral load as markers of ART efficacy – the only way to evaluate the
efficacy of a strategy is to require otherwise healthy people living with HIV (PLWH) who have achieved viral
suppression to pause their ART. This pausing is called an analytical treatment interruption (ATI) and is the most
controversial aspect of HIV cure research. Further, to advance HIV cure research, participants are required to
tolerate extended ATIs, which are long periods of high levels of uncontrolled viremia. The goals of the proposed
research are to investigate the informed consent process and participants' understanding and experiences with
extended ATIs, and use a robust consensus-building technique to resolve the most pressing ethical challenges
in HIV cure research. Aims 1 – 2 are nested within four entirely unique trials across the U.S. with a combined
total of 120 participants. The studies are taking place through the AIDS Clinical Trials Group Network (ACTG)
and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Aim 1 will evaluate the quality of informed consent in 30
participants going through an ATI study, and survey data will be collected measuring perceived benefits, risks,
understanding of study procedures, expectations, and relevant psychosocial domains (e.g., HIV stigma,
resilience). Aims 2 will prospectively evaluate the psychosocial experiences, quantitatively and qualitatively, of
HIV cure research participants before, during and after ATIs. This involves the analysis of strategically placed,
and fully integrated prospective psychosocial survey assessments and interviews from study entry to exit.
Surveys include measures of anxiety-related outcomes to monitor potential for psychological harm and stress
levels during the ATI (among other domains). In addition, Aim 3 involves the use of a hybrid Delphi process to
build consensus for strategies to address evolving ethical challenges in HIV cure research. A panel of experts
are selected from across the U.S. to engage in four rounds of surveys, with community partners providing input
on survey results in between rounds. The goal is to hone in on consensus around how to address racial and
ethnic differences and medical mistrust as a barrier to engagement in HIV cure research (including women living
with HIV), how to implement ATIs safely, how to address psychosocial harms, and how to protect sexual partners
during ATIs. The proposed aims will show how people living with HIV understand and experience cutting-edge
HIV cure strategies that can only be evaluated through extended ATIs. The potential impact of this research will
result in concrete sets of recommendations and actionable items to enhance the informed consent process to
reduce consent misunderstanding, report on any psychosocial harms and development of risk mitigation plans,
and set guidance on implementation of HIV cure research centering on needs of priority populations."

Night shift work is known to increase risk for cardiovascular disease, cancer, and metabolic syndrome, but an
adverse effect that has received little attention is the disruption of bone metabolism. Animal and human data
suggest sleep restriction and circadian disruption, which are inherent in night shift work, are novel, potentially
modifiable risk factors for low bone mineral density (BMD) and increased fracture risk. Humans exposed to
several weeks of cumulative sleep restriction and concurrent circadian disruption induced by a recurring 28
hour/day protocol had significantly decreased bone formation, with no change or an increase in bone
resorption. These changes in bone metabolism, if persistent, would be predicted to increase fracture risk by
limiting the development of peak BMD in young adults and/or accelerating bone loss later in life. In fact, the
Nurses’ Health Study identified an increased risk of fracture in postmenopausal women who reported 20+
years of night shift work compared to those who never worked the night shift. The acute and chronic skeletal
effects of typical night shift schedules in humans, underlying mechanisms, and bone’s ability to recover or
adapt are unknown. This application will fill these knowledge gaps by using simulated acute and real-world
chronic night shift work to evaluate its effects on bone. The scientific objectives are to determine the effects
of night shift work on bone metabolism, density, microarchitecture and strength, and investigate a plausible
underlying mechanism (e.g., increased sympathetic tone) by which night shift work impairs bone metabolism to
promote optimal bone strength and healthy aging. The specific aims are to:
 1. Expose healthy adults to normal sleep or simulated night shift work to
 (a) Determine if a typical night shift work schedule acutely uncouples bone turnover markers;
 (b) Investigate increased sympathetic tone as a mechanism for the disruption in bone metabolism; and
 (c) Evaluate whether resumption of a normal sleep/wake pattern reverses bone turnover marker uncoupling.
 2. Characterize changes in bone turnover markers, BMD, bone microarchitecture and strength by evaluating
 a cohort of hospital nurses in their first year of night compared to day shift work.
This interdisciplinary, collaborative research will enhance the health of individuals. It will generate human data
to establish night shift work as a novel, potentially modifiable risk factor for impaired bone health and inform
mechanisms by which it alters bone metabolism in women and men. This knowledge will provide an
opportunity to intervene to prevent low bone mass, osteoporosis and fractures, including the loss of functional
independence and mortality they cause. Furthermore, this line of research offers new treatment options for
bone health. This research will ultimately inform clinical recommendations for night shift workers and introduce
a paradigm shift in the prevention, evaluation and treatment of osteoporosis."

The immune response to a peripheral infection is a fundamental feature of the human immune system,
providing robust protection from a myriad of infectious agents. The response necessarily invokes the innate
immune system, but many features of this orchestrated response are poorly understood, limiting our ability to
augment the response to new and ever evolving threats. In particular, the innate response engages the bone
marrow to modify the magnitude and dynamics of the response. There are important differences between the
mouse (primary model to study the innate immune response) and human innate immune responses, in
particular scale and dynamics, and new technologies in 3D cell and tissue culture provide exciting
opportunities in the field known as “organ-on-a-chip”. The primary goal of this project is to design, build, and
validate an integrated human “ImmuneChip” platform that mimics key dynamic features of the production and
trafficking of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN, i.e., neutrophils) between the bone marrow, systemic
circulation, and peripheral site of bacterial infection. Developing this technology is important because of the
alarming expansion of antibiotic resistance bacteria which will demand creative and alternative approaches to
combat. The specific aims are to: 1) design, build, and test a microfluidic ImmuneChip that simulates the
homeostatic interaction between bone marrow, systemic circulation, and a sterile skin model; 2) establish a
homeostatic circuit in the ImmuneChip in which HSPC expansion, PMN trafficking, and antimicrobial defenses
respond to soluble mediators of bacterial infection; and 3) demonstrate an appropriate response to contain a
methicillin-resistant (and sensitive) S. aureus peripheral infection within the ImmuneChip, and produce a test-
bed for novel biological strategies to combat infection. The in vitro model will be able to uniquely simulate the
dynamics of peripheral infection-bone marrow communication including transport barriers, residence time in
the circulation, and dilution due to the large difference in the size of the compartments. Accomplishing our
primary goal will create a technology that advances a new class of model systems to understand the human
response to peripheral infection."

Regulatory T cell (Treg) therapy has been widely investigated for control of immune responses in different models
of autoimmunity and transplantation. Despite promising results in using Tregs and chimeric antigen receptor
(CAR) Tregs for tolerance induction, there are still major concerns regarding the plasticity of Tregs and the effect
of T cell-depleting conditioning regimens on these cells that need to be addressed before their clinical application.
We have discovered that CD2-KO Tregs and CAR Tregs are not only resistant to a conditioning regimen that
includes anti-CD2 antibody (siplizumab), but also have increased FOXP3 expression and Treg functionality in
vitro and in vivo. CD2 is a costimulatory molecule that is present in all T cells, including Tregs. Potential direct
or indirect link between CD2 signaling and FOXP3 is not known. Our preliminary data show that CD2-KO Tregs
have increased mTORc1 activity, glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. We hypothesize that metabolically-
active CD2-KO Tregs generate metabolites that through histone modification or post-translational modifications
increase FOXP3 levels. In Aim 1, we will address these hypotheses. We will study CD2+ and CD2-KO Tregs at
the genome, epigenome, transcriptome and protein levels and evaluate their metabolism and signaling
pathways. In Aim 2, we will explore the translational aspects of this discovery in xenotransplantation setting. We
have developed and validated a CAR against a universal pig antigen (class-I swine leukocyte antigen (SLA))
and have shown that SLA CAR Tregs harbor higher suppressive capacity in suppressing anti-pig immune
responses in vitro as compared to polyclonal Tregs. We hypothesize that CD2-KO SLA CAR Tregs resist
conversion to effector T cells and protect transplanted pig organs in an antigen-specific manner. We will evaluate
the resistance of CD2-KO SLA CAR Tregs to conversion in inflammatory conditions and also the efficacy of CD2-
KO SLA CAR Tregs in preventing the rejection of pig islets in a humanized mouse model of xeno-islet
transplantation. Taken together, this work can potentially lead to the development of safer and more efficient
Treg-based immunotherapies. Mechanistic studies could uncover molecules and/or signaling pathways involved
in determining the fate/function of Tregs, targeting of which could alter the immune balance toward tolerance."

Nearly 800,000 people in the United States (US) each year experience acute stroke, which remains the leading
cause of adult disability and 5th leading cause of death. Despite the proliferation of stroke centers nationwide,
almost half of the US population lives beyond a 60-minute drive of a comprehensive stroke center (CSC) and
most patients are initially evaluated at a primary stroke center (PSC). While a key treatment, alteplase can be
delivered at most US hospitals, advanced diagnostics and treatments are only available at CSCs. However,
the PSC “Door-in-Door-Out” (DIDO) evaluation process for patients who need to be transferred to a CSC can
be time consuming and inefficient, contributing to inability to receive treatment. Building upon our prior work to
reduce PSC DIDO time, this proposal, “Implementation of a Stroke Protocol for Emergency Evaluation and
Disposition (I-SPEED)” seeks to (1) Implement a novel, evidence-based, multi-component DIDO intervention in
eight diverse stroke systems of care across multiple regions of the US and (2) Conduct a dual evaluation of its
effectiveness in reducing median DIDO time (primary outcome) and disability (secondary outcome) and of the
fidelity and quality of implementation. The I-SPEED study will definitively establish the effectiveness and
generalizability of a multi-component evidence-based DIDO intervention and provide information about
contextual adaptations for high-quality implementation and widespread dissemination. This study benefits from
our well-established interdisciplinary expertise in stroke, emergency and prehospital medicine, systems and
quality engineering, health services research, and strong multicenter research collaborations. Findings from I-
SPEED will have substantial implications for a wide range of hospitals and stroke systems of care worldwide."
10839917,"The immune system changes with age and gradually leads to incompetent immune responses against
pathogens. Immune cells experience senescence, an irreversible cell cycle arrest, and secrete senescence-
associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors, causing pathological alterations of spatial organization and
cell types in the germinal centers (GCs) of lymphoid organs. GC structures are impaired in the elderly
population, reducing antibody production in aging individuals. B cell immunometabolism is crucial to meet the
energy needs of rapid proliferation, somatic hypermutation, and affinity-based selection in GCs. However, the
coordination of metabolic pathways in T follicular helper cells (TFH) and GC B cells is still not clearly
understood. There is a critical need to decipher the TFH-dependent B cell immunometabolism at the single cell
level in GCs for identifying aging-associated molecular defects. Thus, this project will leverage the recently
developed spatially resolved metabolic profiling framework (3D-SMF) that maps the CD4+ T cell and B cell
subsets and their metabolic correlates in native lymphoid tissues. Our long-term goal is to generate single cell
metabolic insights of TFH-dependent B cell development in GCs of elderly individuals compared to young
ones. The goal of this project is to define spatially resolved B cell immunometabolism pixel-by-pixel in fixed
human tonsil and lymph node tissues. We hypothesize that unique metabolic programs of cellular senescence
and SASP factor diversity are regulated by lipid metabolism events, causing age-dependent unique immunity;
and these programs are distinctively potent in subtypes of secondary lymphoid organs in younger aged groups
compared to the older ones. The rationale for this hypothesis is based on the 3D-SMF data showing depletion
and enrichment of fatty acids in GCs located in native tonsil tissues. The central hypothesis will be tested by
pursuing two specific Aims. Aim 1 will provide a deeper understanding of the lipid-associated
immunometabolism in TFH cells and B-cell subsets (naïve, GC B cells, and plasma cells) in human tonsil
tissues. Aim 2 will define how the metabolic network modeling of TFH and B cell subtypes and overall cell
composition differs in lymph nodes in comparison to tonsil tissues. To accomplish these Aims, 3D-SMF and
multiplexed enzyme profiling will be used to analyze B cell immunometabolism using a metabolic network
comparison of B cell subsets in native tonsils and lymph nodes. This project builds an interdisciplinary team
integrating experts from single cell biotechnology, bioengineering, inflammation in aging, metabolic modeling,
and bioinformatics. The proposed application is innovative because it uses cutting-edge technology to define
spatial metabolomics and proteomics of tonsil and lymph node tissues without dissociation protocols and shifts
from the traditional focus on isolating T cell and B cells from their native microenvironment to study immune
defects in aging. This research is significant because it defines TFH-dependent B cell immunometabolism in
lymphoid tissues to decipher single-cell metabolic fingerprints of immune dysregulation in aging."
10818629,"Abstract
An attractive strategy for cancer treatment is to strengthen the ability of the patient’s immune system to detect
and clear cancerous cells. However, antibody-based immune checkpoint inhibitors have limited effectiveness
against some types of tumors such as diffuse large B cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma, while solid tumors
such as sarcomas are often more broadly resistant to both immune checkpoint inhibitors and cell-based
immunotherapy. Therefore, further immunotherapy options are necessary for these indications. The objective of
our research is to develop a drug conjugate that stimulates the immune response to cancer by targeting BTN3A1.
This protein is required for activation of gamma delta T cells and functions as an immune checkpoint in alpha
beta T cells. Gamma delta T cells exhibit different patterns of tumor infiltration relative to alpha beta T cells
targeted by current immunotherapy approaches, and some recent studies have shown that when gamma delta
cells can infiltrate tumors they can even have a stronger impact on overall survival relative to tumor infiltrating
alpha beta cells. Therefore, gamma delta T cell activation holds great promise for cancer immunotherapy in
cases where alpha beta T cells are ineffective. In contrast to T cells that express the alpha beta T cell receptor
and respond to peptide antigens, T cells that express the Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cell receptor respond to small
phosphorous-containing compounds known as phosphoantigens (pAgs) and are MHC independent, which can
be a benefit to immunotherapy. However, no known direct activators of gamma delta T cells are available for
human use. The transmembrane pAg receptor BTN3A1 is critical for TCR mediated Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cell
activation. Due to MHC independence and non-traditional antigen response, BTN3A1 ligands offer a potential
alternative to boost anti-cancer immunity when immune checkpoint therapy fails. Here, we propose to test the
central hypothesis that novel synthetic pHLIP-pAg conjugates can engage BTN3A1 in tumors to trigger an anti-
cancer immune response. To develop tumor specific distribution of the pAgs, we will take advantage of the
emerging pHLIP (pH (low) insertion peptide) which inserts into tumor cell membranes in the acidic tumor
microenvironment. We will synthesize pHLIP-pAg conjugates optimized for in vivo application and characterize
their activation of gamma delta T cells. We will examine the activity of these new conjugates in cellular and
animal models of lymphoma, assessing both the activity and potential toxicity of these novel agents. Additional
studies will evaluate the conjugates against more immunologically cold sarcomas. The ultimate goal is to identify
a pHLIP-pAg that will be used for treatment of cancers that are resistant to immune checkpoint inhibitors. These
findings will come at a time when the biological understanding of anti-cancer immunity is far from complete, and
thus these studies have the potential for dramatic impact on the field of cancer immunotherapy."

clinical centers (CCs) in enrolling and sustaining a diverse cohort; enable the efficient and
standardized capture of multi-modal cohort data with repeated measurements; model the data to
understand mechanistic underpinnings of APS, including the interplay of underlying and static risk
factors; and segment the population into similar prognostic and predictive phenotypes. This will
enable scientific progress towards a deeper mechanistic understanding of critical illness
syndromes and recovery. Functionally, we will 1) Implement the study design, data capture, and
statistical analysis unit. Coordinate protocol development; establish a REDCap-based data
collection, management, and security framework; conduct and support analyses; generate
reports; make curated data widely available for research through a facilitated storefront; 2)
Implement the clinical research management unit. Maintain cohort integrity and adherence to the
protocol and manual of operations, perform routine monitoring of data quality and site
performance; training of study staff; image and biospecimen management. Support site
communications; facilitate recruitment and retention; and 3) Implement the stakeholder
engagement and development unit. Establish bidirectional, longitudinal engagement from diverse
communities; help CCs build and sustain trust; ensure strengths of each CC are nurtured and
shared; facilitate dissemination of findings; support skills and career development among
research teams. Our efforts will expand foundational work on APS phenotyping, identify gaps,
and help create methods for redefining critical illness syndromes with the ultimate goal of
improving and personalizing management strategies that will curtail the devastating morbidity and
mortality caused by APS."
10890641,"Recently, it has been discovered that osteocytes are multifunctional cells that can serve as targets to develop
new therapeutics. However, it is not known if osteocytes can be a therapeutic target for osteomyelitis and
periodontitis, and if so, which molecular mechanism can be targeted. To our surprise, the magnitude of
Pam3CSK4-induced calvarial osteolysis in “osteocyte MYD88-restoration mice” was similar to wild-type
animals even though MYD88 was globally deleted in all other cells including immune cells. Subcutaneous
inflammatory infiltrates expressed TNF-ɑ, IL-1β, and IL-6 and were rich in neutrophils and macrophages.
These findings suggest that osteocyte-derived inflammatory factors are inducing bone resorption and
inflammatory cell migration. In vitro, the multiplex analysis showed that Pam3CSK4 stimulates the secretion of
CCL2, CCL3, CXCL1, and IL-6 from primary osteocytes. In addition, “osteocyte MYD88-restoration mice”
exhibited bacterially-induced periodontitis with alveolar bone loss. Together, our data provide the novel
observation suggesting that MYD88 pathway activation of osteocytes alone is sufficient to trigger and develop
considerable inflammatory osteolysis. More importantly, these data offer the opportunity to target the
activation of immune cells and osteoclast progenitors on the bone surface through the osteocyte and its
molecular signaling mechanisms. However, it remains unknown how bacterially-induced osteolysis is
controlled by the osteocyte MYD88 pathway when normal (MYD88-sufficient) immune and osteoclast
progenitor cells are present. Furthermore, it remains untested if MYD88 is a convincing beneficial drug target
for osteolysis due to bone infections in vivo. We hypothesize that A) MYD88-mediated osteocyte inflammation
regulates osteolysis in cooperation with normal immune and osteoclast progenitor cells and B) blocking the
osteocyte MYD88 pathway by MYD88 inhibitors suppresses osteocyte-derived inflammatory mediators,
resulting in the protection against and treatment of osteolysis due to bone infections. To test the hypotheses,
the following specific aims are proposed: Aim 1) Determine the impact of the deletion of osteocyte MYD88
function on calvarial osteolysis. Aim 2) Determine the impact of the deletion of osteocyte MYD88 function on
P.gingivalis-induced periodontitis. Aim 3) Determine whether and how pharmacological inhibition of osteocyte
MYD88 can be effective for treating osteolysis due to bacterial inflammation. We propose that the osteocytes
play a role in bacterially-induced osteolysis conditions and understanding the important role could lead to new
therapeutics. We will uncover a novel and essential role of osteocytes as inflammatory cells that regulate
immune cell activation and osteoclast formation. The new aspect of osteocytes will provide new therapeutic
strategies for osteomyelitis and periodontitis."
10652008,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Progression of chronic liver disease to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and cancer is the common course of several liver
diseases, but treatments for the end-stage liver disease are limited highlighting the critical need to identify a
novel therapeutic target. Despite the numerous evidence indicating that accumulation of hepatic progenitor cells
(HPCs) - the epithelial compartment of ductular reactions - is associated with fibrosis, definitive evidence
supporting the causal role of HPCs in progression of fibrotic liver disease and cancer remains largely uncertain
mainly due the lack of a mouse model that allows conditional labeling and tracing of HPCs. Furthermore, although
increased angiogenesis in cirrhotic livers is a risk factor for tumorigenesis, whether and how HPCs signal to
endothelial cells remains as a knowledge gap. We have previously reported that the forkhead box L1 (Foxl1)-
Cre transgenic line can be used for specific labeling and isolation of HPCs. Using this new mouse model, we
generated preliminary data indicating that inhibition of Notch signaling in HPCs leads to decreased angiogenesis
and fibrosis in mice with chronic liver disease and increased differentiation of HPCs into cells with hepatocytic
morphology. Our data also indicate that HPCs secrete several paracrine factors to stimulate proliferation of
endothelial cells and angiogenic gene expression. This led to our central hypothesis that Foxl1+ HPCs promote
progression of liver disease by crosstalking with endothelial cells and hepatic stellate cells in a paracrine manner,
and modulation of the Notch signaling pathway is a valid strategy to promote differentiation of HPCs and inhibit
pathogenic mechanisms. We propose HPCs as a novel and unique cellular target that can be modulated to
simultaneously inhibit progression of fibrotic liver disease and tumorigenesis and promote liver regeneration. Our
overall objective for the proposed study is to establish the causal role of HPCs in pathogenesis using
experimental models that recapitulate progression of human fibrotic disease. We will test our hypothesis with the
following specific aims: Aim 1 will determine the role of the Notch signaling pathway in reprogramming of Foxl1+
HPCs into mature hepatocytes in vivo. Aim 2 will determine the cellular and molecular mechanism by which
Foxl1+ HPCs regulate disease progression. Aim 3 will determine the requirement for Foxl1+ HPCs in multiple
stages of tumorigenesis."
10817961,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Sarcoidosis is a chronic multi-organ granulomatous disease of unknown etiology, typically characterized
by lung involvement, which disproportionately affects African-American women. Sarcoidosis is thought to be
caused by environmental factors in the setting of a genetically susceptible host. Although sarcoidosis has a
significant genetic basis, the genetic architecture of sarcoidosis risk is poorly defined. In preliminary studies,
the PI's team has performed a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) using the Vanderbilt University's
genetic biobank (BioVU) to investigate the phenotypic consequences of an African ancestry-specific loss-of-
function frameshift variant in the PLA2R1 gene. PLA2R1 encodes the phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R), a
transmembrane protein from the mannose receptor family, whose biological function is not clearly understood.
We have unexpectedly discovered that African-Americans homozygous for the PLA2R1 frameshift variant have
about 5-fold higher risk of sarcoidosis and 10-fold higher risk of tuberculosis. The objective of this research is
to corroborate and expand upon these preliminary findings by analyzing biospecimens from “A Case Controlled
Etiologic Study of Sarcoidosis (ACCESS)” as an independent validation cohort. Our central hypothesis is that
PLA2R1 deficiency increases the risk of sarcoidosis among African-Americans in the ACCESS study, in part
by increasing susceptibility to latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Studies proposed in Aim 1A
seek to validate genetic PLA2R1 deficiency as a monogenic cause of sarcoidosis among African-Americans in
the ACCESS study. Aim 1B will establish whether genetic PLA2R1 deficiency increases sarcoidosis risk
specifically among African-Americans with latent tuberculosis infection. Aim 2 will determine whether
sarcoidosis may be triggered by an acquired PLA2R loss-of-function triggered by the development of inhibitory
anti-PLA2R auto-antibodies. The rationale for these studies is that a detailed understanding of the phenotypic
consequences of the complete PLA2R1 deficiency is a powerful tool to unveil the actual biological roles of
human PLA2R using human genetics. This collaborative research project is highly responsive to RFA-HL-23-
018 because it will leverage unique resources from the NHLBI BioLINCC biorepository (DNA and plasma
specimens from the ACCESS study) to investigate a novel genetic cause of sarcoidosis in African-Americans.
The proposed research is innovative because it would represent the first example of a monogenic cause of
sarcoidosis, while providing insights into novel unexpected biological functions of human PLA2R1. This
research is significant because genetic PLA2R deficiency could explain as many as 4% of all cases of
sarcoidosis in African-Americans, which is highly relevant to understanding health disparities in this disease."
10923986,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Mitochondria are powerhouses of the cell that are often viewed as bacteria living in the cytosol. Stressed
or damaged mitochondria induce inflammation through activation of multiple innate immune signaling pathways
including the DNA sensing cGAS-STING pathway. We recently showed that deficiency of a cytoplasmic
deglycosylase NGLY1 results in mitochondrial damage and potent activation of the STING pathway. Mutations
in the NGLY1 gene are associated with an early childhood onset neurodegenetive disease with high mortality
and no therapy. We recently established and characterized a Ngly1-deficient mouse model that develop early
onset and progressive deteriorating coordination and motor functions. We also present exciting molecular and
genetic evidence that implicate the mitochondrion-STING axis in neuropathology. The overall goal of this project
is to define the neuro-pathological mechanism of NGLY1-deficiency, with a strong focus on the mechanism of
the mitochondrion-STING axis. Aim 1 will define cell type specificity through genetic and single-cell approaches.
Aim 2 will dissect intracellular signaling pathways in neuronal and glial cells. Aim 3 will evaluate therapies
targeting the mitochondrion-STING axis. Studies proposed here should reveal the central mechanism of the
mitochondrion-STING axis in neuropathology and neurodegeneration, which will have broad implications in many
complex neurogenerative diseases that are affecting millions of people."
10802415,"The heart must continually adapt to a multitude of stimuli and stressors, which are generally divided into
pathologic and physiologic categories. Amongst these, the physiologic stress of pregnancy and its aftermath
(i.e., the postpartum period of lactation and nursing) are relatively less well understood, and much is unknown
about how extra-cardiac signals regulate and coordinate these processes. In a number of diverse maternal
tissues, including mammary glands, adipose and pancreatic β-cells, lactogenic hormones, acting via the prolactin
receptor (PRLR), activate downstream signal transduction and transcriptional regulation machinery to
orchestrate target tissue activity during pregnancy and regression following parturition and nursing. To date,
PRLR signaling in the heart during pregnancy has not been studied. The objective of this grant is to establish a
role for PRLR in adaptation of the heart to pregnancy and the reversal of gestational changes in the postpartum.
We explore the central hypothesis that cardiomyocyte lactogenic signaling, via PRLR, is essential for cardiac
adaptation. We will investigate novel physiologic roles of cardiomyocyte lactogenic signaling in two Specific
Aims. In Aim 1, we will establish the requirement for cardiomyocyte PRLR signaling in the adaptation of the heart
during pregnancy. Similarly, in Aim 2, we will identify a role of cardiomyocyte PRLR signaling in the postpartum
reversal of adaptive gestational changes in the heart, during the nursing period when the mother is lactating. To
do so, we employ a novel and unique genetic mouse model harboring a cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of PRLR
(CM-PRLRKO mice). We examine CM-PRLRKO mice using multiple analyses, including functional
(echocardiography), molecular (gene and protein expression), cellular (histologic), and metabolic (radiolabeled
isotope tracing) studies. Together, these studies will demonstrate that PRLR is required for normal gestational
cardiac remodeling, as well as for the cardioprotective benefits of lactation and breastfeeding, such that absence
of PRLR signaling or failure to nurse and lactate will have adverse effects on cardiac function and remodeling.
This research is significant because these studies would be the first to establish a physiologic role for PRLR
signaling in the adaptive responses of the maternal heart. At a fundamental level, these studies would expand
our understanding of the context and molecular mechanisms by which hormones regulate cardiomyocyte
function, and may identify novel pathways by which the heart restores itself following acute physiologic stressors."
10911261,"The purpose of this Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award is to prepare the candidate, Dr. Maya Elias, for an independent program of geriatric critical care research. More than 60% of intensive care unit (ICU) patients are adults ages 60 and older. Following hospital discharge, about 25% of ICU survivors experience cognitive impairment comparable in severity to mild Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. Moreover, ICU survivors often experience sleep disturbances and inactivity, and almost 80% of ICU patients experience disturbances in circadian rhythm, which may affect cognitive function. The scientific premises of the proposed study are: 1) a combined sleep promotion and cognitive training intervention will have synergistic effects to mitigate the risk of cognitive impairment and development of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias in older ICU survivors; and 2) chronotherapeutic timing of interventions (i.e., adjusting timing of interventions according to circadian rhythm profiles) may improve intervention efficacy. The proposed research and training build upon prior NIH-funded postdoctoral research conducted by Dr. Elias (F32NR018585). Training Aim 1 will develop expertise in designing and refining behavioral sleep and cognitive interventions through training in clinical trial methodologies and statistical analyses. Training Aim 2 will expand knowledge of circadian science and chronotherapy to examine circadian rhythm as a mechanistic factor underlying delirium and cognitive decline related to Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias in older ICU survivors. This Career Development Award will also support Dr. Elias to lead a clinical trial, which will evaluate feasibility of existing behavioral sleep and cognitive interventions to inform the design of a larger randomized controlled trial. Using a 2 x 2 factorial design, 100 English- or Spanish-speaking older ICU survivors will be enrolled after discharge out of the ICU and randomized to one of 4 combinations of two interventions: SLEEP [nighttime use of earplugs and eye masks] and COG [daily computerized cognitive training sessions]. Specific Aim 1 will test the separate and combined effects of SLEEP and COG, versus AC [active control], in improving cognitive function for older ICU survivors. Specific Aim 2 will examine circadian rhythm parameters of continuous body temperature to determine the optimal window for timing of the COG intervention. Specific Aim 3 will examine if the effects of each intervention [SLEEP + COG, SLEEP, COG] on cognitive function are mediated by sleep and activity, and will examine if selected biological and clinical factors moderate the intervention effects. Exploratory Aim 4 will explore the effect of each intervention on cognitive function at 1 month and incident Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias at 6 months and 12 months after hospital discharge. Results will yield crucial preliminary data for future clinical trials and will guide Dr. Elias to establish a program of research testing interventions that will improve outcomes for older ICU survivors throughout recovery from critical illness."

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogenous group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders,
characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and a tendency to progress to acute myeloid leukemia in 30% of
the patients. Currently the only curative therapy for MDS is allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation
(HCT). However, the mortality after HCT is high due to relapsed disease and transplant-related complications.
The commonly used MDS prognostic models for HCT only consider non-genetic factors, thus could not
accurately predict the outcomes after HCT. Novel predictive markers are therefore critically needed to identify
patients who are most likely to benefit from HCT. Mitochondria play a critical role in hematopoietic cell
homeostasis and differentiation. Genetic and epigenetic alterations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) can impair
mitochondrial functions and play a pathophysiological role in MDS. This Career Development Award will
provide training and research experience to Dr. Dong to support her long-term career goal of becoming an
independent investigator in integrative molecular epidemiology, with a focus on applying state-of-the-art
omics technologies and innovative population-based epidemiologic methods to reduce the burden of
hematologic diseases. While Dr. Dong has had comprehensive training in genetics and epidemiology, she
requires further training in methodologies of HCT-related outcomes and epigenetics. She has assembled a
mentoring team comprised of a primary mentor, Dr. Raul Urrutia, Director in the Genomic Sciences and
Precision Medicine Center and renowned leader in genomics, epigenomics and precise medicine; and two
co-mentors: Dr. Wael Saber, Professor and Scientific Director in the Acute and Chronic Leukemia Working
Committees in the CIBMTR specializing in HCT and MDS; Dr. Paul Auer, Professor and Cancer Center Core
Director with expertise in statistics and bioinformatics. Leveraging the existing whole genome sequencing
data from the “MDS Genomics and Epigenetics Study” in the CIBMTR, Dr. Dong will focus on mitochondrial
genome to address the research gaps mentioned above: 1) determine mitochondrial genomic landscape
associated with MDS outcomes after allo-HCT; 2) quantify mtDNA copy number and evaluate its associations
with MDS outcomes after HCT; and 3) identify mtDNA methylation profiles associated with MDS outcomes
after HCT. The findings will improve our understanding of MDS etiology and provide additional molecular
predictors of MDS outcomes after HCT to help developing individualized risk prediction and targeted
treatments."

The general purpose of this proposal is to provide the principle investigator (PI) with the experience and
skills necessary to become a successful and independent vision researcher. Lowering intraocular pressure
(IOP), the primary modifiable risk factor for glaucoma and the mainstay of treatment, does not halt the
progression of glaucoma in many cases. This discrepancy highlights gaps in our understanding of how IOP-
induced mechanical stressors cause damage to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the major cell type affected in
glaucoma. Thus, the PI’s long-term goal is to develop an independent research program dedicated to
investigating mechanisms by which RGCs and their cellular and structural support system respond to
mechanical stressors. These studies will set the stage for the development of new treatments, with the
potential to prevent RGC death regardless of IOP.
The consensus in the field is that the initial site of RGC injury occurs at the optic nerve head (ONH). Of the
cells of the ONH, astrocytes are the most likely sensors of these mechanical stressors. A prime candidate
through which astrocytes sense and respond to mechanical stimuli is mechanosensitive channels. In Aim 1,
we will test the hypothesis that astrocytes are key mechanosensors within the ONH, and that they translate
changes in surrounding stiffness and mechanical strain into alterations in ECM integrity and tissue
stiffening. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that inhibition of ONH astrocyte Piezo mechanosensitive
channel activity will prevent IOP-induced astrocyte reactivity and RGC death. We will use a combination of
tissue engineering techniques, biomechanical tools, and in vivo glaucoma models to accomplish our specific
aims. By analyzing ONH astrocyte mechanosensation in glaucoma through a mentored approach, and by
acquiring a solid foundation in the fields of astrocyte/matrix biology, mechanobiology, tissue engineering,
and glaucoma model systems, the PI will uniquely position herself to identify such novel drug targets. The
success of the proposed research and career development plan is reinforced by the exceptional multi-tiered
mentoring environment at the Center for Vision Research at SUNY UMU, participation in the Syracuse
Biomaterials Institute at Syracuse University, state-of-the-art facilities, and a strongly collaborative research
community."

Computational modeling approaches are rarely applied to the right ventricle even though, like left
ventricular failure (LVF), right ventricular failure (RVF) is multifactorial, multiscale and causes significant
morbidity and mortality. In comparison to LVF, RVF is understudied with the important consequence that no
RV-specific therapies exist. Computational multi-scale modeling offers a unique opportunity to integrate
dysfunction manifest at multiple scales: at the organelle level, there are impairments of mitochondria, Ca2+-
handling, and myofilament function; at the tissue level, there is myocyte necrosis, apoptosis, fibrosis and capillary
rarefaction; at the organ level, hypertrophy and dilation; and at the organism level, exercise intolerance.
Moreover, computational modeling is ideally suited to answering the question: what are the relative contributions
from abnormalities at multiple scales to the overall phenotype of RVF?
We propose to answer this question with a data-driven, multiscale, computational modeling approach.
Beginning with an existing mitochondrial kinetic computational model fit to healthy and RVF mitochondrial
function, we will predict the emergence of dysfunction at the tissue-level. Then, fitting a myocardial tissue
computational model to healthy and RVF passive and active mechanics, we will predict emergence of
dysfunction at the organ-level. Finally, by adapting an existing biventricular mechanics computational model to
healthy and RVF pressure-volume dynamics, we will predict the emergence of dysfunction at the organism-level,
i.e., exercise intolerance. Model assumptions and predictions will be driven-by and tested against experimental
data collected using state-of-the-art techniques at the organelle-, tissue-, organ-, and organism-scales at multiple
time points in an established rat model of RVF. Finally, we will use our data-driven computational modeling
approach to confirm the human disease relevance of mechanisms of RVF found in rodent using our state-of-the-
art experimental techniques on human failing and nonfailing myocardium. Our specific aims are:
Aim 1: Determine the drivers of systolic dysfunction in RVF. We hypothesize that the major driver of systolic
dysfunction in RVF is impaired mitochondrial generation of ATP leading to impaired contraction of cardiac
myofilaments. We will test this hypothesis with scale-specific models and multi-scale experimental data collected
from rats with RVF.
Aim 2: Determine the drivers of diastolic dysfunction in RVF. We hypothesize that diastolic dysfunction in
RVF is driven by fibrosis and impaired myofilament relaxation. We will test this hypothesis with scale-specific
models and multi-scale experimental data collected from rats with RVF.
Aim 3: Determine the drivers of systolic and diastolic function in human RVF. Key predictions of organelle-
and tissue-scale structural and functional drivers of RVF will be tested with multiscale modeling validated with
state-of-the-art measurements at these scales in non-failing and failing human heart tissues."

The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) provides support for trainees from the
undergraduate to the post-doctoral level in the fields of genome sciences, medicine and ethical, legal and
social implications. The annual meeting is a venue for NHGRI trainees to present their research and learn
about other research and programs, to network and begin to develop collaborations with other trainees and
faculty, and gain experience of attending professional scientific conferences (this will be the first professional
meeting for some trainees). Through this award, we will provide continued support for this excellent annual
event for trainees and strive to enhance the impact, learning efficiency and networking opportunities with new
and innovative technologies to address the changing landscape, in part brought on by COVID19. These will
include a meeting app, quarterly virtual meetings, a virtual mentorship platform, and career development
opportunities. Specifically, we will provide pre- and post-meeting support as well as onsite support during the
meeting. To inform meeting planning and ensure that meeting activities are responsive to trainees’ needs and
interest, we will establish a planning advisory committee to work with us throughout the year, comprised
primarily of trainees. We will work closely with program staff on details regarding meeting location, structure,
and agenda. In light of the novel coronavirus and societal events regarding race and justice, facilitating regular
connections between trainees, faculty, and program staff can yield multiple benefits to maintain momentum in
research and training, personal well-being, and attainment of career goals and higher education. Through the
virtual quarterly meetings, we aim to help reduce the impact and burden of the upheaval and uncertainty in the
research and academic environment due to current events on trainees’ progress as well as their health and
well-being, foster additional mentoring and peer support, and identify areas where new interventions and
support are needed. In addition to providing a platform to discuss research and training opportunities, we
aspire to develop a culture of support and build a web-based resource for trainees in the genome community to
recognize trainees’ achievements and provide information regarding employment, training, and educational
opportunities. Overall, these changes will optimize the efficiency and productivity of the annual in-person
meeting, provide flexibility and sustain relationships formed at the in-person meeting as well as foster new
ones to provide networking opportunities and peer support."

 Vascular dysfunction, such as decreases in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and disruption of the blood brain barrier
(BBB) are early symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and could contribute to AD onset and progression. In the
brain, specialized cells called pericytes are integral to proper vascular function, as they play a major role in
regulating CBF and maintaining BBB integrity. However, the processes that govern pericyte dysfunction and the
role of pericytes in decreases of CBF in AD development have not been fully elucidated. Our previous studies
have demonstrated that increases in the transcription factor Fli-1 are associated with pericyte dysfunction and
viability via up-regulation of caspase-1 expression. Our preliminary data demonstrated that Fli-1 levels were
higher in the hippocampus and superior temporal gyrus regions of brain tissue from AD patients compared to
controls. Pericytes undergo apoptosis in the hippocampus of AD patients, and pericyte Fli-1 levels were
increased in AD patients. In addition, TNF and aggregated amyloid- induced Fli-1 expression in cultured
human brain pericytes. Furthermore, amyloid- induced pericyte apoptosis, as evidenced by decreased pericyte
viability, increased TUNEL positive cells, and increased expression of apoptosis marker caspase-3. Knockdown
of Fli-1 with antisense oligonucleotide Gapmers suppressed amyloid--induced pericyte death, apoptosis, and
caspase-3 levels. Thus, increased Fli-1 levels in AD patients may lead to pericyte loss. To determine the cause-
effect relationship between increased Fli-1 and AD development, we conducted studies in the 5xFAD mouse
model. Fli-1 levels were higher in the hippocampus in 5xFAD mice and corresponded with spatial learning and
memory impairment in Novel Object Recognition and Morris Water Maze tests. Injection of Fli-1 Gapmer into the
hippocampus significantly decreased Fli-1 and inflammatory mediator levels, mitigated pericye loss and vascular
leakage, suppressed adhesion molecule levels, reduced A deposition, and ameliorated spatial learning and
memory impairment. These data provide the first evidence that increased Fli-1 levels contribute to AD
development. We hypothesize that the transcription factor Fli-1 elevation in Alzheimer's disease leads to
pericyte dysfunction and brain hypoperfusion. Three specific aims are proposed to address this hypothesis:
Aim 1: Determine how Fli-1 regulates pericyte and neurovascular cell dysfunction in a mouse AD model. Aim 2:
Elucidate the mechanisms by which pericyte dysfunction results in brain hypoperfusion and cognitive impairment
in a mouse AD model. Aim 3: Test the therapeutic potential of intrathecal administration of Fli-1 Gapmers in
mouse AD models. The successful completion of the proposed studies will result in a better understanding of
the role of Fli-1 in regulating pericyte dysfunction in AD and the development of a novel treatment strategy for
AD."

 Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) affects 12% of Americans due to the growing number of individuals
with metabolic disorders, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, obesity, metabolic syndromes, and diabetes.
At present, there are no pharmacological options approved for NASH. Wnt/beta-catenin pathway and adenosine
monophosphate-activated kinase (AMPK) are crucial pathways in regulation of hepatic metabolism. Genetic and
pharmacological evidence supports a benefit by inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin on hepatic metabolism;
meanwhile, AMPK activation has emerged as a mechanism against NASH. We have synthesized and tested a
novel class of compounds, of which triazole YW1128 showed dual activities of Wnt/beta-catenin inhibition and
AMPK activation via the mechanism of Axin stabilization. YW1128 showed an exciting efficacy against hepatic
steatosis both in vitro and in mice. Based on the chemical structure of YW1128, we recently designed and
synthesized the new lead YA6060. While maintaining the dual activities, YA6060 has exhibited a highly promising
drug-like profile and particularly an exciting efficacy against hepatic steatosis and fibrosis. We also discovered
the tankyrase-binding protein 1 (TNKS1bp1 or TAB182) as a binding target of our lead compounds. The
proposed studies are intended to test the hypothesis that simultaneously inhibiting Wnt/beta-catenin pathway
and activating AMPK, by stabilizing cellular Axin level via targeting TAB182 with small molecules, is a novel
therapeutic strategy for NASH treatment. To test this hypothesis, we will first synthesize and evaluate new
compounds that inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signaling and activate AMPK, using an iterative process involving new
analog design, synthetic chemistry, in vitro assessment of drug properties, and in vivo pharmacokinetic and
toxicity evaluation. Second, by conducting in vitro and in vivo experiments including ligand binding assays,
genetic knockdown, transgene expression, genetic mutation, chemical inhibition or activation, and various
functional assays, we will determine the mechanism of action for lead compounds in hepatocytes and mice.
Lastly, we will evaluate the efficacy of YA6060 and a new YA6060-based lead compound and validate their
pharmacological mechanism in mouse models with a full range of NASH indications. Successful completion of
this project is expected to establish that small molecules with dual activities of Wnt/beta-catenin inhibition and
AMPK activation via targeting TAB182 and Axin stabilization is a valid resource for the development of NASH
therapeutics. The knowledge and small molecules are expected to greatly benefit future research in
understanding of NASH pathogenesis. Eventually, we expect to transform NASH patient care with a first-in-class
drug."

In many types of human diseases, pathogenesis can be attributed to impaired structure or function of biomacromolecules,
including biomolecules, macromolecular complexes, and organelles. In eukaryotic cells, mechanisms of maintaining their
integrity at the molecular/cellular level is known as quality control pathways, which monitor and repair damage to biological
entities. Interference of the quality control pathways has been linked to the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of a wide
spectrum of human diseases. Intriguingly, pathological hallmarks caused by quality control defects, such as aggregation of
defective proteins and damaged organelles, often co-occur in many human diseases, suggesting that different quality control
pathways may interact and assemble a network in response to diverse type of cellular stress. However, whether and how
they interact remains a mystery. The ambiguity in our knowledge of the mechanisms by which they interact has significantly
limited our understanding of the role of quality control pathways in pathogenesis, as well as our options for simultaneously
mitigating both pathological abnormalities in disease interventions. My long-term goal is to understand the biology of
different quality control systems, how they cooperate to maintain cell/tissue integrity, and how their deficiencies contribute
to the pathogenesis of human diseases. Currently, most research focuses on the role of a single quality control system, and
little is known about how different systems cooperate with each other. My previous work has demonstrated that when faced
with mitochondrial stress, RQC (ribosome-associated protein quality control) targets the translational arrest of a specific
group of mitochondrial proteins encoded by the nuclear genome. RQC generates CTEs (carboxyl-terminus extensions) on
nascent peptide chains in a 40S/mRNA template-independent manner. CTE-modified mitochondrial proteins severely
impair mitochondrial function, potentially linking RQC to MQC (mitochondrial quality control). I have further adopted new
methodologies to assess the efficiency of different quality control systems and developed novel animal models that pave
the way for analyzing the communication between quality control pathways. In unpublished work, we found evidence that
split ribosomal subunits from stalled translation machinery have unique and critical roles in linking different levels of quality
controls pathways, and in coordination with other cellular signaling pathways. For the next 5-year period, my lab will focus
on dissecting their molecular basis. The questions we ask are, what signaling pathways connect and regulate, or can be
connected and regulated by stalled/dissociated ribosomal subunits, during stress response. The answer to these questions
will fill gaps in our knowledge of a fundamental biological concept, namely how cells mobilize different quality control
pathways in response to various stresses. They will also gain insights into how dysregulation of quality control mechanisms
simultaneously contributes to the development of co-occurring pathological features in disease pathogenesis."

Hematopoietic cell transplantation from related and unrelated donors can cure life-threatening blood disorders;
however, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and relapse remain the major obstacles. When matched donors
are not available, the properties of that govern (un)favorable HLA mismatches are not well-defined. These
deficiencies have important implications for a large fraction of patients who lack HLA-matched donors, and for
all patients at risk for disease relapse. The advent of improved GVHD prevention regimens has increased the
safety and efficacy of haploidentical transplantation and it is anticipated that its use in multi-locus mismatched
unrelated transplantation will substantially increase options for patients. The unmet needs are to understand
the mechanisms through which HLA-DR and -DQ genes modulate transplant risks, and a means to apply the
research findings to clinical care. We have recently identified important features of HLA-DQ molecules and
HLA-DR expression that describe (un)favorable mismatches, and they represent an entirely new paradigm for
the HLA class II region. We propose to define the underlying mechanisms through which matched and
mismatched HLA-DR and -DQ function in transplantation. The specific aims are to: determine the role of HLA-
DQ structure and expression in outcome; determine the role of HLA-DRβ molecules in outcome; determine the
impact of HLA-DR-DQ haplotype variation on clinical outcome after HLA-matched and -mismatched allogeneic
transplantation, and design tools to translate class II features into clinical practice. The goals will be achieved
through systemic analysis of HLA-DR and -DQ variation, peptide repertoire and expression in large ethnically
diverse transplant populations with complete clinical data. This proposal will fill the knowledge gap in the
immunobiological basis of GVHD, relapse and survivorship in transplantation. The information will increase the
safety, efficacy and availability of transplantation for all patients in need of this life-saving therapy."

Individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have a 10%-30% higher risk of fractures than age-matched individuals
without T2D. However, the current paradox is that fragility fractures among people with T2D occur despite
apparently normal bone mineral density (BMD) measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Older
individuals with T2D have high fracture rates have low bone turnover, while high bone turnover increases the
risk of fracture in similarly aged non-diabetics. Currently available tools (BMD, markers of bone turnover) are
inadequate to screen or monitor bone health in individuals with T2D who have a high prevalence of fragility
fractures. Indirect measures of bone quality assessed from DXA images, the geometric parameters of the
femoral neck, and the lumbar spine Trabecular Bone Score (LS-TBS) has been recently associated with
fracture risk in older individuals. Identifying the best phenotype, genetic risk factors, and associated functional
changes is critical to detecting the earliest bone changes in older adults with T2D and the underlying metabolic
pathways leading to skeletal changes in participants with T2D. However, current research on skeletal health in
T2D is mainly gleaned from research in populations primarily of non-Hispanic Whites, even though Mexican
Americans (MA), the largest Hispanic/Latino (H/L) subgroup in the USA, have the highest prevalence of T2D
and osteoporosis. We propose to address these research gaps by leveraging our new and existing genetic and
phenotypic data on the population-based Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC) study using cross-
sectional and longitudinal designs. Our main goal is to investigate the causal pathways to bone loss and quality
and examine changes in metabolic and structural phenotypes in a sample of MA adults aged over 50 years.
The aims are to (1) Estimate the association of T2D on longitudinal changes in bone traits; (2) Identify
transcriptomic patterns associated with longitudinal changes in bone traits; and (3) Identify genetic
risk factors for bone traits, perform colocalization, and explore the causal role of T2D and metabolic
risk on bone quality via Mendelian randomization. We
expect
that
mechanistic insights into genetic and
transcriptomic factors associated with T2D and metabolic dysfunction that influence pathways leading to poor
skeletal health lead us to identify novel targets for early prevention and clinical intervention of osteoporosis and
fractures among older MA adults."

 Marijuana, a federal illegal drug, is used by millions of people across all age groups, race, and sex.
Tobacco, which causes more disease and death than any other preventable cause, is used by even more
people. Importantly, most marijuana users also use tobacco. This is concerning because evidence suggests
that the health risk of combined marijuana-tobacco use (also known as co-use) is greater than that caused by
use of marijuana by itself. Understanding what leads to or causes sustained co-use of these two substances
and the health consequences of co-use is important to preserving public health.
 Studies have described intake of ∆-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive chemical in
marijuana, and its effects from various marijuana-only products, including smoked, vaporized, and oral forms,
but studies assessing the combined effects of marijuana and tobacco are scarce. To the best of our
knowledge, no study has examined effects of marijuana and tobacco co-administration by systematically
changing the amount of both THC and nicotine delivered to users. This has been a barrier to understanding the
relationship between marijuana-tobacco co-use and health outcomes.
 The central aim of the project is to describe the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of THC-nicotine
co-administration. In this foundational study, we will use a loose-leaf vaporizer to deliver doses of both THC
and nicotine from marijuana and tobacco, respectively. We hypothesize that marijuana-tobacco co-
administration will lead to larger effects than when the substances are used by themselves, particularly at
lower doses of THC and nicotine. This includes higher THC and nicotine intake and systemic exposure, and
more than additive cardiovascular responses. We will test these hypotheses with the following aims:
 (1) Describe and compare THC and nicotine pharmacokinetics and acute physiologic effects, including,
heart rate changes, catecholamine release, skin blood flow, and platelet aggregation from various
combinations of marijuana and tobacco; (2) Describe and compare sensory and subjective effects such as
high, liking, craving reduction, and psychological reward from administration of various combinations of
marijuana and tobacco; (3) Examine differences in self-administration of THC and nicotine from various
combinations of marijuana and tobacco during ad libitum access.
 This proposal will advance the field, providing one of few experimental studies on marijuana-tobacco
interaction, the first that manipulates both THC and nicotine dose. It will inform our understanding of why users
co-use marijuana and tobacco and of potential health consequences related to simultaneous THC and nicotine
intake."

MicroRNAs (miRs) are evolutionally conserved small non-coding RNA molecules that are broadly involved in
regulating most biological events; previous studies have focused on the canonical mRNA interference (RNAi)
mechanism of miRs. During the previous funding period, we were the first to unveil an evolutionarily-
conserved novel biophysical action for miRs beyond its RNAi mechanism. Specifically, we revealed a
novel biophysical action of miR1, which is the most predominant miR in the heart and is downregulated in
human heart failure. We found that miR1 physically binds to an inward rectifier potassium channel Kir2.1,
directly suppresses the IK1 current and biophysically modulates cardiac cellular electrophysiology. Importantly,
we found that a human single nucleotide polymorphism (hSNP) of miR1–– hSNP14A/G (rs776480338), in
which the 14th nucleotide “A” is mutated to “G”, is a RNAi-only variant that specifically abolishes the biophysical
action while maintaining the RNAi function of miR1, validating that the biophysical modulation is independent
of RNAi. Our discoveries suggest that miRs modulate cardiac homeostasis through two different mechanisms:
1) canonical RNAi that regulates the expression of proteins, including ion channels, and 2) newly-discovered
mechanism of direct binding with proteins that quickly results in functional modulation. With this important
new finding, it is now imperative to investigate if multiple cardiac ion channels are biophysically modulated by
miRs and to elucidate the specific physiological impact of miR1’s biophysical action in the regulation of cardiac
(electro)physiology. Based on our published findings and preliminary data, we hypothesize that the
biophysical modulation of cardiac ion channels by miRs is a general regulatory mechanism that exists broadly
and plays a critical role in the homeostasis of the heart. We will study this with the following specific aims. 1)
To investigate the biophysical modulation of cardiac ion channels by miR1, 2) To understand the physiological
impact of miRs’ biophysical action on the heart, 3) To unveil the general mechanisms guiding miRs’
biophysical modulation of cardiac ion channels. In addition to a broad range of cellular activities regulated by
the large number of miRs (>30,000 miRs in >200 species) and ion channels, our study will significantly and
innovatively expand the biological significance of miR biology and ion channel biology with broad implications.
Our discoveries have pioneered a new field in miR biology and will provide a mechanistic foundation and new
avenue of RNA-medicine development for antiarrhythmic therapy."
10877815,"Active membrane transport is central to many cell processes, including the acquisition of
nutrients, the establishment of ion-gradients, the regulation of osmotic balance, ATP synthesis,
and apoptosis. The proposed work will address key questions regarding the mechanisms of
nutrient uptake in Escherichia coli, and it will address questions regarding the structure and
organization of these proteins in the bacterial outer-membrane. In E. coli, a range of nutrients
are transported by specific outer-membrane proteins that derive energy by coupling to the inner-
membrane protein TonB. These TonB-dependent transporters include BtuB, which is
responsible for vitamin B12 transport, and FhuA, FecA and FepA, which are responsible for the
transport of various forms of chelated iron. TonB-dependent transporters are abundant in Gram
negative bacteria, and they are critical to the proper functioning of the human microbiome where
they are responsible for the acquisition and initial processing of some carbohydrates. They are
also essential for the success of many bacterial pathogens, such as those that result in
meningitis, cholera, pertussis and dysentery; and because TonB-dependent transport is unique
to bacteria, it is thought to be a target for the development of new classes of antibiotics.
High-resolution crystallographic models have been obtained for approximately two dozen TonB-
dependent transporters; however, the mechanism by which transport takes place is unclear.
One difficulty is that structural and biophysical studies in-vitro have never been made on TonB-
dependent transport proteins that are known to be active. The proposed work will test models
for the molecular mechanisms of transport and examine structural states that are only observed
in cells. The role of lipopolysaccharide in altering transport protein structure will also be
examined. The proposed work will employ site-directed spin labeling and EPR spectroscopy
where novel approaches have been developed to perform pulse experiments, such as double
electron-electron resonance, in intact E. coli. In the outer-membrane, proteins are sequestered
into domains or islands, which are thought to drive the turnover of outer-membrane proteins in
bacteria. EPR will be used in E. coli to characterize the protein-protein interactions that drive
domain formation and define the supramolecular structure of the outer-membrane."

Mucosal surfaces account for the vast majority of transmission events for human retroviruses – e.g., human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). HIV-1 and HTLV-1
infection through the oral cavity represents a significant gateway for postnatal transmission from mother to child.
Virus spread via cell-to-cell transmission aids in establishment of viral infection in a newly infected individual.
While significant advancements in our understanding of retrovirus replication have been made, there are many
details that remain poorly understood. For instance, it is still unclear how virus particle assembly sites are
determined and how viral structural proteins and genetic material translocate to these locations on the inner
leaflet of the plasma membrane. The details of viral particle assembly are particularly unknown in the context of
cell-to-cell transmission. In this application, I propose to use molecular virology and state-of-the-art imaging
approaches to elucidate mechanisms of cell-to-cell transmission of different human retroviruses by comparative
analyses. It is well documented that HTLV-1 is efficiently transmitted via cell-cell contacts, i.e., the virological
synapse (VS). This is likely also the case for HIV-1 but has been commonly underappreciated. Virus transmission
at cell-cell contacts via the formation of a VS can result in polarized virus particle release into the VS. Virus
particle formation is driven by the Gag structural protein, which multimerizes at the virus assembly site (e.g.,
points of cell contact), resulting in particle biogenesis and release. In preliminary studies, our lab has observed
that the pool of Gag utilized in particle biogenesis in non-polarized cells was primarily recruited from the plasma
membrane for HTLV-1 whereas for HIV-1 Gag is recruited from the cytoplasm. This fundamental observation of
differential modes of Gag recruitment to particle assembly sites may help explain the distinct reliance of cell-to-
cell transmission as a productive mode of virus spread for HTLV-1 compared with that of HIV-1. I propose 2 lines
of investigation for this application. I will first investigate whether the differences in HIV-1 and HTLV-1 Gag puncta
biogenesis observed in non-polarized cells are also conserved in polarized cells. Second, I will investigate virus-
host cell interactions that help facilitate human retrovirus assembly, particularly in the context of cell-cell contacts,
which is of particular significance in oral biology. An important aspect of this aim will be the use of novel and
innovative technology, cryogenic-correlative light and electron microscopy (cryo-CLEM), in order to gain greater
insights into the role(s) of host cellular proteins important for virus assembly. Human retrovirus particle assembly
is a critical step in infectious virus transmission, including oral transmission at mucosal surfaces in the context
of cell-cell contacts. These studies will help contribute new information to better understand key aspects of
human retroviral replication that are not fully understood and represent knowledge gaps in the field of virology
and will provide critical information to aid in the prevention of retroviral transmission through the oral cavity."
10894131,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The striking prevalence of obesity and its associated personal and public health consequences highlights the
importance of understanding why individuals overeat and gain weight. It is widely recognized that overeating
results from a combination of homeostatic (i.e., nutrient need, hunger) and hedonic (i.e., pleasure, reward) drives.
While these homeostatic (e.g., hypothalamic) and hedonic [e.g., midbrain dopamine (DA)] systems have been
characterized as discrete drivers of food intake, there is considerable evidence that these systems overlap. For
example, DA signaling in response to food is potentiated by hunger, increasing the reward value of food during
times of homeostatic need. Our recent findings in rodent models revealed a neural correlate for the interaction
between homeostatic and hedonic systems. Activity in hunger-sensitive, hypothalamic agouti-related protein
(AgRP)-expressing neurons potentiates the DA response to food. Conversely, DA signaling enhances the
homeostatic AgRP neuron response to food. What are the circuits through which AgRP and DA neurons interact
in response to food? Do they help explain why some individuals are more likely to overeat and gain weight? This
proposal will test the overarching hypotheses that distinct AgRP and DA neuron subpopulations mediate the
interaction between homeostatic and reward signaling and that individual differences in AgRP and DA responses
to food predict future weight gain. Aim I experiments will determine the AgRP neuron projection subpopulations
that potentiate DA responses to food. We will leverage the anatomical organization of AgRP neurons, as well as
optogenetic and chemogenetic technologies, to individually test how each AgRP projection subpopulation
influences food-evoked DA signaling. Aim II experiments will determine sites of action for DA modulation of AgRP
neuron activity. We will use genetic and pharmacological approaches to examine how DA projections and
neurotransmitter signaling influence AgRP neuron activity. Aim III will determine how AgRP and DA activity
predicts future overeating and weight gain. Taking advantage of the variability in weight gain in response to a
high-fat, high-sugar diet, we will determine if individual differences in neural activity in lean mice predict future
overeating and the development of obesity. Overall, these experiments take a unique approach to understanding
weight gain by (1) determining the neural intersection of homeostatic and hedonic circuits that have classically
been considered discrete drivers of intake and (2) identifying neural activity biomarkers to predict overeating and
obesity predisposition. Ultimately, results from the proposed studies will reveal cellular and molecular targets
that can be leveraged to develop obesity prevention and more effective weight loss strategies."

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide, with 5-
year survival less than 12%. Paralleling the increased incidence of HCC is the rise of obesity and the related
metabolic syndrome including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and recent epidemiologic studies
directly link NAFLD to HCC. The identification of obesity as a major modifiable risk factor for HCC development
highlights the urgency of understanding the underlying mechanisms that drive the linkage of NAFLD and HCC.
Our long-term goal is to understand the molecular mechanism underlying obesity related HCC and develop
novel therapeutic strategies. The overall objective for this grant is to investigate how nuclear receptor CAR
regulates HCC lipid synthesis to promote tumorigenesis and determine whether simultaneously blocking CAR
and lipid uptake is effective in obesity related HCC. Our preliminary results demonstrate that suppressing CAR
activity via Inverse Agonist (CAR-IA) inhibits mouse HCC growth with normal chow diet, however this tumor
inhibition effect can be completely reversed by high fat diet (HFD) feeding. Mechanistically, we found that CAR
suppression by CAR-IA inhibits tumor lipid synthesis in both mouse and human HCC. CD36 mediated lipid
uptake potentially reverse lipid deprivation condition and growth inhibition caused by CAR-IA in HCC from HFD
feeding. These exciting results support our hypothesis that (1) suppressing CAR inhibits normal chow HCC
growth through repressing tumor lipid synthesis and (2) blockade of both CAR mediated de novo lipid
synthesis and CD36 mediated exogenous lipid uptake will provide synthetic lethality in obesity associated HCC.
In Aim 1, we will define the mechanisms by which CAR inhibition represses HCC lipid synthesis and growth.
Aim 2 will determine whether lipid uptake blockade sensitizes mouse HCC/HFD to CAR inhibition. Lastly, Aim
3 will define the impact of CAR suppression on normal and obesity related human HCC. Targeting tumor lipid
synthesis has opened a promising therapeutic window for many tumors, including HCC. However, strong toxic
effects and limited effectiveness of the current lipogenic inhibitors have confounded clinical trials. In contrast,
CAR suppression by mouse CAR-IA shows no toxicity in mice and human CAR-IA meclizine is an FDA proved
antihistamine drug. Importantly, this proposal integrates the overlapping roles of lipid synthesis and uptake in
obesity related HCC. Successful deployment of co-treatment with inhibitors for lipid synthesis and uptake
would have a major impact on obesity related HCC."
10825622,"Project Summary / Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating dementia that occurs either in rare, familial forms or in common,
sporadic forms. Current understanding of AD pathogenic mechanisms is incomplete, and amyloidocentric
clinical trials have failed to show therapeutic efficacy, highlighting the need for a better understanding of AD
pathogenic mechanisms to find new strategies of intervention. Dysregulated endosomal trafficking is
increasingly recognized as a pathological hub in AD pathogenesis, but the molecular basis of endosomal
dysfunction in AD remains unclear. Recent discovery of endosomal trafficking regulator SORL1 (sortilin-
related receptor 1, also known as SORLA or LR11) as a major risk factor for both early-onset and late-
onset AD opens up a new avenue for studying the pathogenic mechanisms that trigger endosomal
dysfunction and neurodegeneration in AD. SORL1 has emerged as the fourth gene for autosomal-
dominant familial AD, with loss-of-function SORL1 truncation mutations conferring high pathogenicity to a
similar extent as that caused by mutations in the three well-known familial AD genes: amyloid precursor
protein (APP) and presenilins 1 and 2. Furthermore, missense variants in the coding region of SORL1 gene
have been identified as a genetic risk factor for development of sporadic AD. SORL1 is a sorting receptor
in the control of cargo trafficking between endosome, trans-Golgi network (TGN), and plasma membrane.
Increasing evidence indicates that SORL1 plays a key neuroprotective role against A accumulation and
neurodegeneration by promoting APP trafficking from endosome to TGN and to cell surface, facilitating A
trafficking to lysosome for degradation, and maintaining the integrity of the endo-lysosomal system. Despite
strong evidence linking SORL1 dysfunction to AD pathogenesis, the molecular mechanisms that regulate
SORL1 function remain poorly understood. The proposed project aims to address this knowledge gap and
perform innovative research to elucidate SORL1 regulation mechanisms and their alterations in AD. The
findings and novel insights generated from this project will advance our understanding of SORL1
dysfunction and endosomal trafficking dysregulation in AD and may point to new therapeutic strategies for
AD treatment."

Binge eating disorder (BED) is a prevalent disorder, affecting 3.5% of Americans. BED is maintained by two-
pathways: (1) dietary over-restriction and (2) emotion dysregulation. Current treatments for BED, such as
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) produce suboptimal results because they only target over-restriction.
Mindfulness meditation (MM) targets emotion dysregulation and could thus be an important addition to CBT for
Eating Disorders. Furthermore, digital delivery of an MMT for BED would offer unprecedented scalability, but
there are no current digital MMTs for BED. The current K23 proposal involves developing a digital Mindfulness
Meditation-enhanced Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT-MM) for BED via two phases. CBT-MM will target the
two different mechanisms of BED (dietary over-restriction and emotion dysregulation). In Phase 1, I will finalize
the development of digital CBT-MM via interview-based user testing. In Phase 2, I will conduct a pilot feasibility
randomized controlled trial (RCT). For the RCT, 40 individuals with BED recruited nationally will be randomized
to digital: 1) CBT-MM (n = 20); or 2) an already developed digital CBT treatment (iTakeControl) only (n = 20).
The RCT will be conducted virtually, with video-based assessments at baseline, mid- and post-treatment, and
3-month follow up. Aim 1 is to develop digital CBT-MM. Aim 2 is to evaluate feasibility and acceptability. Aim 3
is to measure within-group changes from pre-to post treatment on binge eating remission, binge eating
frequency, weight, quality of life, depressive symptoms, emotion dysregulation, dietary over-restriction, and
trait mindfulness. This project has the potential for developing an innovative, theory-driven, efficacious, and
scalable mindfulness-based treatment for BED that can have a large public health impact. To carry out this
K23, I will receive mentorship from a leading team of experts in the areas of mindfulness, CBT for eating
disorders, technology-based treatment development, and qualitative methods. This K23 will specifically
facilitate my training in: (1) developing and refining mindfulness-based eating and weight disorder treatments;
(2) technology-based treatment development, (3) formalized training in conducting clinical trials, and (4)
qualitative methods for intervention development. This award will serve as a launching point for my career as I
leverage the training and research skills afforded by this award to become a leader in the field of digital
mindfulness-based treatment development for eating and weight disorders."

 4  Vanderbilt University with a focus epigenetic factors in the development and progression of renal cancer.
 5  Career Goals and Objectives: My career goal is to become an independent, tenure-track faculty member at a high-caliber
 6  research institution, working with an interdisciplinary team, and focusing on identifying new therapies for kidney cancer.
 7  Career Development and Training Activities: My training plan revolves around mentorship, didactic training, and

 9  will train me in laboratory and personnel management, grant administration, and translational kidney cancer research. Dr.
10  Jeff Rathmell will provide mentorship in tumor microenvironment, and Dr. Gyan Bhanot will provide mentorship in
11  computational biology. I will attend selected seminars and workshops, and continue responsible conduct in research training.
12  Significance and Innovation: Although immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has shown remarkable success in treating
13  metastatic kidney cancer (RCC), not all patients respond to therapy. We recently reported that high expression of
14  endogenous retroviruses, a class of transposable element (TE), occurs in a subset of RCC tumors and can predict response
15  to ICB in RCC. Mobile genomic elements, TEs are usually suppressed by a number of epigenetic mechanisms. Aberrant
16  expression of TEs can activate host antiviral responses and produce neoantigens, and in some RCCs, activate antiviral response
17  that results in increased immunogenicity, characterized by increased immune infiltrate. Thus, it is our premise that epigenetic
18  modulation of TE expression represents a novel therapeutic strategy to enhance response to ICB in RCC and other cancers.
19  Approach: Based evidence to date, I hypothesize 1) that epigenetic activation of TEs enhances neoantigen production to
20  contribute to immunogenicity in RCC, and 2) that additional epigenetic mechanisms exist that regulate TE activity and that
21  these can be manipulated to promote immunogenicity.
22  Specific Aim 1: Define the role that epigenetic activation of transposable elements has in neoepitope production. 1A)
23  Interrogate transcriptional landscapes associated with epigenetic activation of TEs. 1B) Identify naturally processed TE-
24  associated neoepitopes.
25  Specific Aim 2: Define additional epigenetic mechanisms governing TE expression. 2A) Define epigenetic mechanisms
26  mediating TE suppression. 2B) Determine how epigenetic activation of TEs mediate host antiviral response. 2C) Elucidate
27  mechanisms behind TE-induced IFN signaling.
28  Transition to Independence: I will apply to faculty positions during the Mentored phase and accepting a tenure track
29  position to transition to the Independent phase. My goal is to characterize novel mechanisms for TE-associated antitumor
30  immunity and identify novel targets regulating TEs. These studies will serve as the basis for an NCI R01 application."

The Skin Translational Research (STaR) Core aims to foster innovative and pathophysiologically relevant skin
biology and disease research by facilitating experiments using human primary samples. Fresh human skin and
primary skin cells are highly valuable resources that help to extend skin research throughout the larger
scientific community at our institution, evidenced by the large number of investigators outside the Department
of Dermatology who have previously used our Core services and subsequently submitted new abstracts,
publications, and grant applications on skin biology. By combining highly utilized primary tissue services with
innovative tissue engineering, high-throughput screening, and biobanking consultation and services, STaR
Core aims to maximize our impact within an even broader scientific community. Our long-term objectives are
to: (1) allow investigators both within and outside the Department of Dermatology to conduct research on skin
biology more efficiently and effectively by centralizing high-volume or specialized technical services and
providing the critical research infrastructure and institutional review board approvals for their use; (2) foster
innovative exploratory projects and junior investigators in skin biology through our core services, with the goal
of promoting new scientific collaborations, abstracts, manuscripts, and grants; (3) promote translational
research by providing access to normal and diseased human skin samples that might not otherwise be
available to non-physicians or have substantial administrative barriers to their use; and (4) integrate our core
directors’ research expertise into future core services to adapt to the emerging needs and opportunities of our
membership. To accomplish these goals we aim to: 1) Accelerate novel pathway discovery through both
targeted investigations of candidate pathways as well as unbiased high-throughput screening assays in
primary human skin cells; 2) Enable 3-dimensional skin biology and disease modeling through ex vivo human
skin cultures, organotypic skin cultures, and human skin xenografts; and 3) Promote research using well-
annotated skin biospecimens by establishing the Penn Dermatology BioBank, which includes both normal and
diseased human skin samples, with or without paired blood samples, including linked clinical and genetic data."

The major focus of Core C, the Data Science and Informatics (DSI) core, is to facilitate human discovery
through basic and translational research in cutaneous biology and disease by providing assistance to
investigators on the planning, design, and analysis (both statistical and informatics) of studies of the skin. The
DSI interacts directly with the other Resource Cores and the overall theme of the SBDRC in that bench and
human translational research needs to be well designed, properly conducted, and correctly analyzed in order
to maintain high standards of rigor and reproducibility. DSI achieves these goals by a combination of
epidemiologic, statistical and informatics approaches. By its very nature, DSI will continue to be highly
collaborative and will add value to the other cores. DSI Core directors will encourage investigators interested in
cutaneous research to work with Core faculty and staff at every stage of design and analysis, thus promoting a
team science approach from hypothesis inception to study execution, analysis, and interpretation. DSI’s
functions are represented by two Aims that leverage expertise of Core faculty and staff in the following areas:
Aim 1: To provide study design and biostatistical services to SBDRC Core users, including: 1) Study design
methodologies necessary to design and implement rigorous experimental and clinical investigations; 2)
Statistical methodologies critical for the evaluation of each project’s research hypotheses including
consideration of sex as a biologic variable; 3) Interpretation of research data to make scientifically and
statistically appropriate statements; 4) Translation of bench findings to human research using translational and
clinical trial designs. Aim 2: To provide biomedical informatics & computational dermatology services to
SBDRC Core users, including: 1) Bioinformatics approaches to allow for the analysis and conceptualization of
large genomic and metagenomic datasets; 2) Artificial intelligence-guided approaches to quantify patterns and
textures in microscopy images; 3) Medical informatics approaches to query medical records databases from
UPHS and extramural sources. A critical barrier to progress in cutaneous biology and skin disease research is
the lack of integration of biostatistical, epidemiological (both quantitative and qualitative), and informatics
approaches to basic and clinical investigation. DSI will significantly add to the overall success of the SBDRC by
addressing this barrier and the specific need for these approaches in human translational research.
Implementing such approaches from inception through project completion will improve the reproducibility, rigor,
and validity of research findings. The other SBDRC Resource Cores and the Administrative Core will be able to
leverage the expertise of DSI faculty and staff to enhance the efficiency, reproducibility, and validity of research

service” for local or non-local investigators interested in accessing ADRC expertise and resources, oversees the
process of timely and compliant sharing of data and resources, and administers a Developmental Project
program to stimulate and support innovative lines of AD+ADRD research. To ensure regular assessment of the
Cores’ and REC’s effectiveness and accessibility, and formal annual evaluation and subsequent response of the
Duke/UNC ADRC, the Administrative Core monitors progress of all Cores/REC and engages an Internal Advisory
Committee (IAC) of institutional leaders and leading AD+ADRD scientists and an External Advisory Board (EAB)
of both scientific and lay members. The Administrative Core Specific Aims are to: 1) Provide coordination as well
as scientific and administrative leadership and oversight to ensure operational efficiency, fiscal responsibility,
and regulatory compliance; 2) Support and promulgate a culture of rigorous AD+ADRD research; 3) Solicit,
select, administer, and monitor developmental projects (DP), from a diverse pool of high-caliber, creative
investigators; 4) Sustain and promote connection between the Duke/UNC ADRC and external stakeholders; 5)
Assess and refine the Duke/UNC ADRC program through an annual evaluation process. A critical role of the
Administrative Core in this new ADRC will be to lead the process of identifying, nurturing, and evaluating “pockets
of opportunity” with an eye toward how such areas should be developed and operationalized, possibly as new
Cores or ancillary studies, as the Center evolves."
10889950,"ABSTRACT - Clinical Core
The Clinical Core is critical to the mission of the Duke/UNC Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, given its role
in recruiting, clinically characterizing, and following a diverse group of individuals that will provide participants,
biomarker data and brain tissue to investigators working on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) at Duke and UNC.
Although we support investigators pursuing any research on AD or Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias
(AD+ADRD), the particular focus of the Core relates to the Center’s theme of identifying changes across the
lifespan, including the onset of comorbidities and cellular and molecular changes associated with aging, that
influence the development, progression, or experience of AD. A related goal is to assist national efforts to
understand the increased prevalence of memory disorders in minority and rural populations. The Clinical Core
will develop and maintain a prospectively followed cohort of 420 research participants, ages 45 to 80,
supplemented with a one-time evaluation of 120 younger participants, allowing our center to investigate age-
related drivers of AD (Aim 1); the cohort will have substantial rural and African-American enrollment, allowing us
to address known disparities related to AD. The Longitudinal Cohort (n=420) will consist of 320 participants who
are cognitively normal at entry and roughly equal in distribution between ages 45 to 80, and with at least 100
participants symptomatic at entry (MCI or dementia). This cohort will enable us to observe key transition periods
related to AD risk, including menopause, onset of comorbidities, and the transition to MCI and dementia. This
cohort design will also allow us to supply Duke and UNC investigators with symptomatic and normal participants
from the outset of the study. The second, Young Cohort (n=120) will consist of participants ages 25-44 who will
undergo a one-time evaluation and biomarker collection. The availability of this unique comparison group, which
is supported almost entirely by institutional funding, will enable investigators to evaluate the degree to which
novel biomarkers or signatures associated with AD in older cohorts are linked to other contributing factors, such
as age or genetic risk. The Clinical Core will perform UDS-based medical, neurologic, psychiatric, and
neuropsychological evaluations (Aim 2). In addition, working with the Biomarker Core, the Clinical Core will
facilitate the collection of blood and cerebrospinal fluid specimens, brain MRI and PET scans, and motor-sensory
assessments including retinal imaging to enable discovery of novel biomarkers (Aim 3). The Core will also
develop and utilize novel and portable testing modalities. The Clinical Core, with the assistance of the Outreach,
Recruitment, and Engagement Core (autopsy consent) and Neuropathology Core (brain recovery), will facilitate
collection of brain tissue obtained at the time of death (Aim 4). The Core will interact with the Data Management
and Statistics Core to ensure all datasets, biological samples and participants are accessible to qualified
investigators (at Duke and UNC for investigator-initiated studies or more broadly) and to share data in a timely
fashion with the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC)."
10889953,"ABSTRACT - DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICS CORE
The Duke/UNC Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) Data Management and Statistics Core provides
essential support to advance understanding of Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias
(AD+ADRD). In support of the Duke/UNC ADRC and the broader dementia research community, the Core will
offer two essential functions: integrated data management and statistical/ bioinformatics collaborative expertise.
Building on strong infrastructure at Duke and UNC, the Core proposes the following Specific Aims: 1) Provide
coordinated and integrated data management capabilities across the Duke/UNC ADRC to allow easy access,
tracking, and reporting capabilities for all of the Cores; 2) Provide datasets to the National Alzheimer’s Disease
Coordinating Center (NACC), to other collaborative efforts in Alzheimer’s disease discovery and prevention, and
to AD+ADRD investigators at Duke/UNC; 3) Provide statistical/bioinformatics design and analysis consultation;
4) Develop statistical/bioinformatics methods to meet the needs of the ADRC and AD+ADRD research
community; and 5) Provide educational opportunities and mentoring of investigators, trainees and junior faculty
in collaboration with the Research Education Component on statistical and bioinformatics methodologies for
AD+ADRD research. The Core’s combination of state-of-the-art, integrated data management applications and
comprehensive statistical expertise enable the creation and expansion of high-impact research initiatives at the
ADRC, including innovative multimodal research projects pursuing identification of age-related drivers of AD
through genetics, metabolomics, gerontology, and neuroimaging."
10889963,"ABSTRACT – BIOMARKER CORE
The objective of the Biomarker Core is to acquire and analyze biofluid and imaging biomarkers, characterize
their relevance to Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and determine the underlying age-related factors that drive the
development, progression, or experience of the disease. To achieve these goals, we bring together experts
across diverse backgrounds in genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and imaging to provide institutional
resources to serve ADRC investigators, help initiate new collaborations, and train the next generation of AD
and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementia (AD+ADRD) biomarkers researchers. Specifically, we propose
four aims: 1) Acquire conventional and novel biomarkers in biofluid (CSF, blood), brain images (PET, MRI),
and sensory organ data (retinal imaging) in adjudicated participant groups. Working closely with the Clinical
Core, we will acquire CSF, blood, PET and MRI biomarkers in our clinical cohort to submit to the National
Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC). At the same time, we will collaborate closely with independently
funded research projects to acquire novel and early biomarkers in high-risk populations during the prodromal
or early symptomatic stages of AD pathology. 2) Analyze biomarkers to obtain standardized measures and
support relevant funded research projects within the ADRC community. We will perform standardized
analyses in biofluid and imaging data to extract conventional biomarkers, and collaborate with existing
funded projects to develop specialized analytics to identify novel biomarkers that can lead to earlier detection
and prevention. 3) Provide resources to ADRC researchers integrating standardized multi-dimensional
biomarkers data across all participants to characterize the underlying age-related drivers for AD. Working
closely with the Data Management and Statistics Core, we will create and curate a multi-dimensional
database, integrating all acquired biomarkers and clinical measures. This database will be used to assist and
train the next generation of AD researchers in their investigations of underlying age-related drivers of AD,
through collaborations with the Research Education Component. 4) Disseminate our expertise and
knowledge to support the AD community at large. Working with the Outreach, Recruitment, and Engagement
Core, we will disseminate our expertise and knowledge on established and emerging biomarkers to the local
AD stakeholder community, other ADRC centers, and AD+ADRD researchers and providers across the
nation. Through these four aims, we hope to help achieve our overall objective to catalyze and support high-
caliber research and innovations to reduce the burden of AD and its impact on patients and families."
10889965,"ABSTRACT - Research Education Component
The primary goal of the Duke/UNC Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) Research Education
Component (REC) is to develop future leaders in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias
(AD+ADRD) research, including within the Center’s theme of identifying age-related changes across the lifespan
that mediate the development, progression and experience of AD. There are unique challenges facing
AD+ADRD research, including limited training in researchprinciples, a lack of early-career exposure to
AD+ADRD research, and research silos that impede knowledge transfer between basic and clinical investigators.
To overcome these challenges, the REC research training program will broadly disseminate a foundational
AD+ADRD research curriculum spanning both basic and clinical research, delivered to five universities across
North Carolina and made available to the public (Aim 1). In addition to delivering broad cross-campus AD+ADRD
research education, the REC will solicit “REC Scholar” applications and select 2-4 scholars annually from a
diverse pool of talented early-career AD+ADRD investigators (Aim 2). REC Scholars will receive intensive
research training and tailored professional development under the guidance of a faculty mentorship team
comprised of a clinical researcher and a basic scientist. The REC will expand the reach of its training program
by leveraging existing training assets at Duke and UNC (e.g., Duke’s “Creating AD Researchers for the Next
Generation” STARR Program (R38), UNC’s “Summer Research Training in Aging for Medical Students” (T35)
and Duke’s Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center and Edward R. Roybal Center). The
REC’s close integration with the other Duke/UNC ADRC cores provides synergistic interactions with key
research training opportunities in specimen biobanking, statistical analysis, study design, pathologic sample
analysis, patient recruitment, and research dissemination. The REC will diversify AD+ADRD researcher
perspectives and the workforce by partnering with UNC Pembroke (a designated historically American Indian
university), NC Central University (an historically black university), and East Carolina University (an institution
with expertise in rural healthcare delivery) (Aim 3). Investigators and trainees at these institutions will participate
in monthly research colloquia, the online curriculum, monthly journal clubs, research consultancies that leverage
Duke/UNC expertise to augment AD+ADRD research at other sites, and the annual Symposium for Learning
about Alzheimer’s disease-related Medical research at Duke and UNC (SLAM-DUNC), hosted by each institution
in turn. REC programming will foster interest in AD+ADRD research and cultivate the multidisciplinary expertise
needed in its next generation of leaders. By fostering interactions among investigators from different disciplines
and backgrounds through the REC’s innovative and inclusive programming, the REC will develop new
AD+ADRD researchers prepared to engage in interdisciplinary collaborations aimed at improving health
outcomes and reducing disparities by bringing novel treatments to the clinic and novel preventive measures to
the population."

Identification of cranial nerves during skull base surgery is critical to avoid iatrogenic injury. Even the
slightest damage to any one of these nerves can hugely affect patient outcomes. Despite the importance
of cranial nerve identification, preoperative imaging struggles to provide the needed information. During
the surgical procedure, electrostimulation techniques are often utilized to provide a point-based analysis
of a nerve and its functional capability, but they remain unable to picture the whole field. In fact, there is
no current clinical tool capable of mapping nerve fibers and displaying their location back to the surgeon
in real time. In this project, we propose to develop an imaging tool that can fill this obvious gap in current
technology and place it directly into the hands of skull base surgeons. This tool will be based on polarization
sensitive optical coherence tomography (OCT), an optical imaging modality that shows exquisite contrast
for myelinated nerves. Recent advances in laser technology (known as circular ranging, invented by
Mentor Dr. Vakoc) have brought OCT lasers to a point where their use is compatible with the motion
induced by standard surgical workflow. This two-aim project seeks to bring circular ranging into the
operating theater during skull base surgery and assess its capability to enhance cranial nerve visualization,
uniquely combining both surgical and technical expertise. This work will take place between two NIH-
funded P41-holding institutions: the Wellman Center for Photomedicine at Massachusetts General Hospital
(MGH), home to the Center for Biomedical OCT Research (CBORT), and Brigham and Women’s Hospital
(BWH), home of the National Center for Image-Guided Therapy (NCIGT) where the resources of the
Advanced Multi-modality Image Guided Operating suite (AMIGO), both in terms of equipment and
experience, will provide the perfect environment to conduct such a study. The candidate for this award is
Dr. Danielle J. Harper, a postdoctoral fellow at MGH and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Harper has been
well trained in the field of biophotonics. Her area of expertise is OCT and its functional extensions, including
polarization mapping and depth-resolved spectroscopy. Her long-term career goal is to reach academic
independence and lead a research group focused on intraoperative optical neuroimaging. To help her
achieve this, Dr. Harper has built a strong team to guide her in all aspects of research and career
development. Dr. Benjamin J. Vakoc at MGH/HMS, an expert in optical imaging, will serve as the primary
mentor. Neurosurgeons Dr. Alexandra J. Golby and Dr. Michael Mooney at BWH will provide mentoring,
guidance, and assistance with all clinical aspects. Dr. Lei Tian of Boston University will provide supervision
and guidance for the deep learning aspects of the project, and Dr. Tayyaba Hasan at MGH/HMS will
provide general career development advice. Supported by this team, this career development award will
give Dr. Harper the remaining skills and training she requires to make the transition to full independence."
10813111,"Policymakers and researchers have long expressed concerns about resident wellbeing in nursing homes because of abuse, neglect, and exploitation. Nursing home residents are particularly susceptible to abuse and neglect because of their age, as well as physical and cognitive decline. Since individuals with Alzheimer ’s disease (AD) and Alzheimer’s Disease Related-Dementias (ADRD) have poorer functional status, more severe cognitive impairment, and are heavily dependent on caregivers for their daily activities, they are more likely to face abuse and mistreatment. Over 20% of nursing homes are cited for abuse, neglect, and exploitation every year. The National Background Check Program (NBCP) is a state-level voluntary program aimed at reducing abuse, neglect, and exploitation of vulnerable residents in long-term care settings including nursing homes. As part of the program requirements for participation in NBCP, states are required to check a) abuse registries of all states in which the prospective employee lived, b) state criminal history records, c) fingerprint-based FBI records, and d) any other records in the state that may have disqualifying information. Federal legislation allows each state to obtain up to $3 million in grants to implement NBCP. Since 2010, 29 states and territories have obtained the funding to implement NBCP over different years and are in various stages of implementation. However, link between background checks and abuse/resident outcomes is not clear. There is some evidence to show that background checks may catch potential abusers before they are hired. Moreover, background checks may also deter potential abusers from applying for jobs in nursing homes. However, background checks may not catch all perpetrators of abuse and implementation of NBCP may also lead to workforce shortages. Our objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of NBCP in lowering resident abuse, neglect, and exploitation and improving patient safety outcomes in nursing homes, overall, and by AD/ADRD census. To achieve this goal, we propose an econometric analysis for three specific aims: 1) To estimate the effect of NBCP on employment of staff who are guilty of abuse, neglect, and exploitation, 2) To estimate the effect of NBCP on citations for abuse, neglect, and exploitation, overall and stratified by high vs. low AD/ADRD census, and 3) To estimate the effect of NBCP on adverse patient quality outcomes: malnutrition, dehydration, depression, falls, pressure sores, infections, and utilization on antipsychotic drugs, overall and for individuals with AD/ADRD. The study results will yield important new knowledge about the effectiveness of NBCP in lowering resident abuse, neglect, and exploitation and improving patient safety outcomes in nursing homes, overall, and for persons with AD/ADRD. Our results have the potential to affect CMS policies on states’ use of NBCP to improve outcomes for AD/ADRD population."
10808956,"Project Summary
Chagas disease, a major public health problem in Latin America, is caused by the infection with the protozoan
parasite Trypanosoma (T.) cruzi and has been spread to non-endemic regions by migratory movements. Chagas
cardiomyopathy represents the most severe complication of chronic Chagas disease in Argentina. This important
illness has become a frequent cause of heart failure, cardio-embolic stroke, and sudden death in our and other
endemic countries. There are still no effective prophylactic vaccines, and chemotherapy mainly relies on
benznidazole, a 60-year-old drug linked to prolonged treatment and significant side effects. This parasite is an
obligate intracellular pathogen that can infect any nucleated cell, but the clinically relevant niches are the
cardiomyocytes since the parasite remains in the heart for several decades before the development of the
cardiomyopathy. Therefore, one of the main challenges in understanding Chagas disease immunopathology is
to find out why the parasite is not completely eliminated, being able to sustain a pathological inflammatory
environment. After infection, the influx of immune cells consumes large amounts of oxygen, and ischemic cells
rapidly respond to the hypoxic and inflammatory environment by releasing ATP to the extracellular milieu. This
extracellular ATP (eATP) triggers microbicidal immune responses but is quickly hydrolyzed to the potent
immunosuppressive metabolite adenosine, mainly via the concerted activity of CD39 and CD73 ectoenzymes.
Increasing evidence suggests that the balance of purinergic signaling determines the immune response's
outcome in different pathological scenarios. We hypothesize that the balance of purinergic responses to eATP
and the nucleosides generated by CD39 and CD73 determines anti-T. cruzi immunity and triggers pathogenic
mechanisms in Chagas disease. Hence, manipulating these signaling pathways could provide new approaches
to limiting cardiac pathology. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Validate
the participation of purinergic signaling in the cardiac response to T. cruzi infection in advanced human Chagas
disease, 2) Determine the impact of CD39-CD73 ectoenzymes on the cellular immune response, and the
progression of Chagas cardiomyopathy by employing experimental murine models, 3) Explore the benefits of
pharmacological targeting of purinergic signaling in a mouse model of Chagas cardiomyopathy. These
investigations will provide a comprehensive understanding of crucial mechanisms through which T. cruzi
infection subverts immune response to sustain parasite persistence and a detailed insight into the biology of the
cardiac response to infection.

 A fundamental step in understanding sensation is understanding how neural circuits in the brain
transform patterns of sensory neuron activity into robust and efficient representations of the external world.
Sensation is an active process in which the detection and initial encoding of sensory information is dynamically
modulated by sampling behavior. Understanding how central circuits process sensory information in the
context of active sampling is critical for understanding the neural basis of sensation in the behaving animal.
The goals of this project are to understand how neural circuits in the mammalian olfactory bulb transform
sensory inputs in vivo and in the context of active odor sampling, or sniffing.
 First, we will examine circuit-level determinants of the diverse patterns of excitatory drive onto mitral
and tufted cells, focusing on the respective roles of sensory inputs and glomerular circuits in generating this
diversity. Second, we will define if and how stimulus features themselves – in particular, odorant chemistry and
intensity – relate to the dynamics of excitatory drive onto MT cells, as well as how these dynamics are shaped
by sniffing behavior. Finally, we will ask how dynamics and glomerular patterns of excitatory input impact the
input-output transformation of the olfactory bulb.
 The proposed experiments implement several innovative approaches to dissecting circuit function in
the intact olfactory bulb; these include using second-generation optical reporters of glutamate to directly image
excitatory signaling onto mitral/tufted cells with high temporal resolution, dual-color imaging of glutamate and
calcium to simultaneously monitor presynaptic inputs and readouts of mitral/tufted cell activity from the same
glomerulus, and the use of identified glomeruli with well-characterized response spectra to design powerful
tests of model predictions.
 The overall impact of the project will be to advance a mechanistic understanding of the relationship
between the dynamics of odor sampling and the resulting dynamics of neural activity in the olfactory bulb.
These findings will pave the way for ultimately understanding the role that neural dynamics and active
sampling play in odor perception."

 Bone injuries are a major health problem. There are 7.9 million bone fractures sustained annually in the U.S. Healing
is impaired in about 10% of these fractures with seriously delayed union or non-union, causing morbidity for patients and
enormous healthcare costs. While strategies such as bone grafting, synthetic polymers, low intensity pulsed ultrasound and
electromagnetic fields, growth factors and cell therapy are currently being used or investigated to promote bone healing,
each of these therapies have their own advantages and disadvantages in terms of cost, effectiveness and safety. Thus, there
is a compelling need to find novel effective therapies that promote fracture healing. Vitamin C and thyroid hormone (TH)
are known to play key roles in endochondral bone formation (EBF). Our recent studies on the molecular pathways for TH
and vitamin C actions revealed evidence that sequential activation of hedgehog and hypoxia signaling pathways contribute
to key steps involved in EBF. Our focus in this project is on the therapeutic utility and mechanisms of action of two small
molecules, SAG 21k and IOX2, that activate hedgehog and hypoxia signaling pathways to promote EBF at the fracture site.
In this proof of concept study, we propose to deliver SAG21K and IOX2 locally using 3D printed fibrin gel/β-tricalcium
phosphate (βTCP) scaffolds at the defect site to provide mechanical strength and minimize unwanted side effects on other
tissues. A clinically relevant segmental defect model in the femoral midshaft in which a 2.5-mm defect is stabilized by an
intramedullary threaded rod with attached plastic spacers that does not heal over a prolonged period will be used. Three
aims are proposed. In aim 1, we will 3D print fibrin gel/β-tricalcium phosphate (βTCP) scaffold preparations containing
SAG21k and IOX2 and evaluate the suitability of these preparations for delivery of effective concentrations of SAG21k
and IOX2 at the optimal therapeutic time window for activation of hedgehog and hypoxia signaling at the fracture site by
measurement of downstream signaling targets of these signaling pathways by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and real time
PCR in the fracture callus of mice at different times. In aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that sequential activation of
hedgehog followed by hypoxia signaling will be effective in promoting healing of femoral segmental defects. We will
compare the efficacy of bone healing with SAG21k and IOX2 with that of autografts, a gold standard used for healing of
nonunion defects. We will use validated microCT, bone strength and histological measurements to evaluate the fracture
healing phenotype. Therapeutic effectiveness of SAG21k/IOX2 combination therapy will be studied using aged and
diabetic mice with impaired fracture healing. In aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that sequential activation of sonic
hedgehog and hypoxia signaling induces bone healing by promoting direct conversion of chondrocytes-to-osteoblasts.
Fracture callus chondrocytes will be labeled with TdTomato by genetic inducible fate mapping approaches and the fate of
labeled chondrocytes to form osteoblasts in the bony callus will be evaluated. The role of chondrocytes in bone healing
will be evaluated after chondrocyte ablation with diphtheria toxin in chondrocyte-specific Col10α1-CreER;iDTR mice. In
terms of clinical relevance, we believe that the potential impact of understanding the utility of SAG21k and IOX2 in bone
healing and their mechanisms of action is huge, and therefore the work proposed in this project is significant."

 This K01 application seeks protected time for mentored research and career development training for Dr.
Rosalyn Sayaman, PhD to successfully transition to tenure-track faculty with an independent research program
in computational and systems biology, supported by the Chair of Department of Laboratory Medicine. Leveraging
the advances in computational and Machine Learning methods and spearheading multi-omic technologies, Dr.
Sayaman seeks to develop a highly integrative research program that can bridge the gap between in-silico
research and translational medicine, with specific focus on advancing personalized medicine in breast cancer.
As a computational biologist with broad training and methodological experience, and a solid experimental
background, Dr. Sayaman is uniquely positioned to carry out this comprehensive study incorporating the parallel
multi-omic dataset for ~2000 women from the I-SPY 2 Trial. The I-SPY 2 neoadjuvant breast cancer clinical trial
is a personalized, adaptive trial designed to improve outcomes in high-risk breast cancer patients.
 Dr. Sayaman’s research proposal employs computational and Machine Learning approaches to dissect
the complex interactions between intrinsic host germline and tumor somatic mutations, and extrinsic tumor
microenvironment (TME) features that mediate the tumor immune response. In Aim 1, Dr. Sayaman elucidates
the role of genomic and TME features in determining the topography of immune populations in the tumor bed. In
Aim 2, she assesses the relative predictive value of these genomic and TME features in predicting subtype-
specific response to neoadjuvant therapy, and 5-year survival in patients who do not respond to therapy. This
work has the potential to generate response-predictive biomarkers that could inform optimal treatment decisions.
 To address the multi-disciplinary aspect of this study, Dr. Sayaman has assembled an exemplary team
of mentors who have complementary domains of expertise. Dr. Sayaman’s primary mentor is Dr. Laura van ‘t
Veer, the Co-Leader of the NCI-designated Breast Oncology Program (BOP) and Director of Applied Genomics
at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and Chair of the I-SPY 2 Biomarker Committee. Dr. van ‘t

10857029,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Latinx adolescents experience higher rates of behavioral health risks compared to their non-Latinx Black and
White peers, particularly for marijuana, alcohol, and cocaine use, depression, and suicidality. Poor mental
health and substance use have been attributed to experiences of adversity, stress, and perceived interpersonal
discrimination. Advances in the field of Latinx youth mental health research has been largely focused on
individual and interpersonal determinants. Few studies examine the impact of social and environmental
contexts, such as those related to immigration status, on Latinx youth mental health. Laws and policies at
federal, state, and local levels, or the absence of such laws, also affect Latinx immigrant stress and access to
resources, increasing mental health risk for Latinx adolescents. These policies shape anti-immigrant
environments and prejudice toward Latinx youth, amplifying experiences of stress and mental health issues.
Inclusive immigration policies increase access to health and social resources. Research examining pathways
between state and local and the mental health of Latinx youth is needed. The proposed study will fill gaps by
applying a transdisciplinary approach to understand and intervene a health disparity and equity issue. The
objectives of this research are to: (1) construct a state-level dataset on interrelated policies that structure
access for Latinx youth; (2) use quasi-experimental methods to quantitatively estimate the effects of state-level
policies on Latinx youth mental health and qualitatively explore how policies shape the social lives of Latinx
youth; and (3) develop community-informed recommendations for prevention and intervention solutions. With a
focus on interdisciplinary collaboration, Temple University offers early career scholars the intellectual and
practical resources to develop into successful independent investigators. The overarching training plan for this
K01 application serves to consider the effects of macrolevel policies that either promote health or produce
inequities related to mental health. The training plan is designed to develop the candidate’s skills in public
health law research and legal epidemiology, quasi-experimental design methods and community-engaged
research to develop ground-level recommendations for prevention and intervention. By engaging in
coursework, trainings, applied experiences, and national conferences, complemented by a transdisciplinary
team of mentors from law, public health, health behavior and translational research fields, Dr. Villamil Grest’s
training and career development plan provides an opportunity to advance her interdisciplinary skills to
understand the upstream, structural level factors that affect the health and well-being of Latinx youth. To
achieve success as an independent scholar and researcher, this K01 will provide skills for the PI to become a
multimethod investigator, examining the social and structural factors that contribute to Latinx youth mental
health disparities, and to inform community-engaged prevention programs and policies."

Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a neurovascular disorder that occurs mainly among extremely preterm
infants. The National Eye Institute (NEI) estimates that every year between 400 and 600 children become legally
blind due to ROP. The goal of this project is to plan a large, multicenter cohort study designed to gather
comprehensive social, clinical, and biomarker data needed to further elucidate the etiology and pathogenesis of
ROP and adverse visual outcomes (AVO) in extremely low gestational age newborns (ELGANs, <28weeks
gestation). The aims of the project are (1) to finalize the consortium and create expert working groups (WGs)
that will tackle the planning tasks in their area of expertise, (2) to develop the study protocol and Manual of
Procedures (MOP), and (3) to outline and perform preliminary and feasibility studies. The planned study will have
multiple innovative elements, the most important being (a) first multicenter observational study with a focus on
ROP/AVO, (b) retina imaging at multiple timepoints after birth, (c) artificial intelligence/machine learning
approaches, (d) social determinants of health, (e) pre- and postnatal biomarker measurements, and (f) visual
and neurodevelopmental outcome assessment."
10832684,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a sudden and severe economic shock which hit low-income households
and households of color most severely. Many U.S. renter households were already housing-cost stressed,
leading to fears of a wave of housing instability and evictions and related effects on other forms of hardship
such as food insecurity. Given that housing instability and eviction are key social determinants of health and
health disparities, overflow effects on mental health were also expected. In 2020-2021 the federal government
allocated $46.6 billion in funding for the Emergency Rental Assistance Program (ERAP) to support state,
county, and municipal governments in addressing rental housing difficulties. The bulk of ERAP funds must be
used for financial assistance for rent and rent arrears, utility assistance and utility arrears, and a limited set of
other housing-related expenses arising from the pandemic (e.g., relocation expenses); states and
municipalities were otherwise given extensive flexibility over the distribution of funds. This project seeks to
provide the first systematic and rigorous evaluation of the ERAP policy.
The overarching goals of this study are to carefully document variation in state and local ERAP design,
including timing of adoption and implementation of various rules, and to evaluate the effects of different
approaches to ERAP using quasi-experimental methods that take advantage of differences across geography
and across time. This study has three key aims. First, we will create a unique, publicly-accessible, and user-
friendly dataset that tracks local, state, and national ERAP policies, the Rental Relief Policy Database (RRPD).
Second, we will merge the RRPD with household survey data from the nationally representative Household
Pulse Survey fielded by the U.S. Census Bureau throughout the pandemic. Pulse includes measures of
housing instability, food insufficiency and other material hardships, and mental health. We will analyze these
data using logistic regression models with state and year indicators which will allow us to estimate the causal
effect of ERAP policies on critical outcomes in renter households. Third, we will link the RRPD to weekly
counts of eviction filings at the Census tract or ZIP code level in 31 U.S. municipal areas. Employing
sophisticated techniques—multilevel zero-inflated negative binomial models—we will evaluate the effects of
state and local ERAP policies on the rate of eviction filings. Results from this work will both increase
understanding of COVID-19 policy effectiveness and trends in inequities, and serve as a blueprint for additional
policy and public health initiatives necessary to stabilize increasingly precarious rental housing."
10834285,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This exploratory project is a collaboration between Huntington's disease (HD) researchers and BRAIN tool
developers and will utilize novel interventional tools for changing neural circuit dynamics to causally link brain
activity to behavior in the context of HD. Almost 30 years after identifying the genetic mutation causing this
debilitating neurodegenerative disease, treatments remain limited to managing late-stage symptoms of motoric,
psychiatric, and cognitive deficits. Findings from patients and mouse models of HD point to pre-symptomatic
imbalances in neuronal circuit activity, well before any overt symptoms are observed. This project will explore
modulating specific microcircuits in the HD brain using tools developed under the BRAIN initiative. Our central
hypothesis is that manipulating the firing activity within selected microcircuits before the onset of symptoms by
chemogenetic inhibition and/or excitation of key target populations will slow HD disease progression. A crucial
early event in HD is the pathological increase in the overall excitatory output from cortex onto striatum. Underlying
mechanisms could be enhanced excitability of cortical pyramidal neurons (PNs) and/or decreased inhibition by
cortical parvalbumin interneurons (PVs) that provide the main inhibitory drive onto PNs. Stimulating PVs offers
a physiologically relevant approach, as it restores this critical input while preserving other modulating synaptic
inputs to the PNs (Aim 1). A second, and more direct, correction is to decrease the firing of the PNs themselves
(Aim 2). Finally, a third approach will convert excitatory synapses into inhibitory ones at the PN terminals which
would directly reduce the hyperactivity of specific striatal neurons during the prodromal phase of the disease
process (Aim 3). Our major goal will be to determine which of the three key entry points provides the most
efficacious strategy for preventing or delaying and mitigating the behavioral deficits in the R6/2 transgenic mouse
model of HD. For manipulation of neuronal activity this project will utilize the bioluminescent optogenetic (BL-
OG) platform that employs light emitting luciferases to activate light sensing opsins, including the recently
developed ‘interluminescence’ approach that enables controlling synaptic transmission by expressing the light
emitter and sensor in pre- and post-synaptic partners, respectively. To achieve our goals, we are combining
expertise in circuit manipulation tool development and HD mouse model behavioral research towards a more
refined understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying complex behaviors. At the same time our project will
drive translational progress toward potential novel therapeutic purposes. In addition to the impact on HD research
our results are expected to have a significant impact on approaching other neurodegenerative diseases that
show circuit imbalances."

The four dengue virus serotypes (DENV1-4) cause the most important mosquito-borne viral disease of humans,
with ~50 million dengue cases annually and over 3 billion people worldwide at risk of infection. Yet, no treatment
is currently approved for use, and the only registered vaccine is not safe and effective in all populations. The
overall approach of this study is to take advantage of unique longitudinal sample sets from our long-standing
cohort study in Nicaragua to address complex questions about DENV antibody and B cell immunology in a
relevant epidemiological context. While antibodies generated in primary DENV infection confer protection against
the same serotype, they can either protect against or enhance a subsequent infection with a different DENV
serotype; however, after a secondary DENV infection, individuals acquire broader protection against multiple
DENV serotypes, and the risk of severe disease is lowered. There is a critical gap in understanding the
generation and maintenance of broadly neutralizing circulating antibodies and B cell immunity stemming
from secondary DENV infection. Our preliminary results show that expansion of B cell recall contributes to
acute secondary DENV immunity and that post-secondary memory B cells (MBCs) display broader cross-
serotype neutralization as compared to post-primary MBCs. We hypothesize that the recruitment of B cell
memory from a primary DENV infection into acute secondary circulating IgG, and then substantial addition of
new lineages from the secondary DENV infection into long-lasting serological and B cell repertoires, together
shape the distinct broadly protective profile of durable post-secondary dengue immunity. In this study, we will
investigate how pre-existing MBCs generated during primary DENV infection and newly elicited lineages in
secondary DENV infection contribute to broad neutralization. In particular, we will identify whether broadly
neutralizing antibodies originate from the pre-existing B cell compartment or are newly elicited in secondary
infection (Aim 1), and how they are maintained in serological or B cell repertoires for future protection (Aim 2).
We will use innovative viral antigens for isolation of DENV-specific antibodies and B cells coupled with state-of-
the-art IgG antibody proteomics (Ig-Seq) and B cell receptor sequencing (BCR-Seq) platforms, with robust
bioinformatics pipelines. Selected representative monoclonal antibodies will be expressed and functionally
evaluated using established, standardized neutralization assays. We have assembled a team with
complementary expertise in B cell biology, flavivirus virology, immunology, and epidemiology, coupled with
cutting-edge ‘antibodyomic’ serological and genomic sequencing technologies and analytic systems. Overall,
the proposed research will begin to define at the cellular and serological level the evolution of antibody-
mediated immunity that generates broad neutralization against DENV upon secondary infection in order
to guide improved vaccine design strategies."
10876928,"The future of dental education and support for biomedical research require investment in the selection and
training of tomorrow's scientists, including basic, translational and clinical researchers. One of the stated goals
of the NIDCR is to “ensure that a diverse network of highly trained scientists is available in appropriate
scientific disciplines to address the Nation's biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research needs”. In an effort to
achieve this goal, we are seeking renewal of our NIDCR-sponsored Institutional Training Program in Oral
Health Research, which provides an array of training opportunities in craniofacial health research. This grant
thus requests support to provide education and intensive, integrated research training for a select cadre of
scholars seeking either a PhD degree or postdoctoral training (for both DDS/MD and PhD graduates) with a
major focus on dental, oral and craniofacial health and disease. Only the most highly qualified and motivated
predoctoral and postdoctoral candidates will be selected for T90/R90 support. The T90 and R90 award
components will allow us to continue to train U.S. citizens and permanent residents as well as non-permanent
residents, who bring a global perspective. International scholars, clinician-scientists and underrepresented
minorities have made, and will continue to make, significant contributions to dental and craniofacial research
and teaching, serving as outstanding role models. We will continue to emphasize selection of qualified,
exceptional candidates from underrepresented backgrounds to further enhance diversity in the biomedical
workplace. At a time when inclusion and understanding have never been more important, fostering a diverse
cohort of academic researchers is a core component of our mission to prepare this next generation of leaders.
Outstanding predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees will be interviewed and chosen by an Internal Steering
Committee (ISC) for an initial 12-month period of support, and provided they demonstrate satisfactory
progress, will be awarded support for another 12 months. Program oversight will be from the Principal
Investigator and Co-Investigator, the ISC, and an advisory External Steering Committee (ESC). Trainee
mentors will be primarily tenured faculty from either the Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry (Ostrow) or the
Keck School of Medicine (Keck) of USC. Mentors have been selected using two simple criteria: 1) they
maintain active research profiles and have a significant history of successful mentorship, and/or 2) they have
current independent research funding from the NIDCR, which serves as a strong indication that their research
interests are in alignment with the stated goals of the NIDCR. During the T90/R90 appointment period trainees
will enroll in grant writing classes, attend seminars and workshops, and submit a competitive peer-reviewed
grant application. Both Ostrow and the Provost's Office at USC remain fully committed to this and similar
federally supported NRSA training grants, and will ensure that additional financial support is in place to achieve
all stated outcomes."
11006240,"Previous studies suggest that use of the recommended prosthetic foot stiffness category and/or ankle
power output setting may not optimize the function of Veterans with transtibial amputations (TTAs). Due to the
functional impairments and lifetime of healthcare costs incurred by Veterans with TTAs, it is vital to determine
how different prosthetic foot and ankle properties/parameters such as passive-elastic prosthetic foot stiffness
and battery-powered prosthetic ankle power output affect the metabolic cost and biomechanics of Veterans
with TTAs. Further, determining the optimal prosthetic foot stiffness and/or power output could dramatically
improve the function of people with TTAs, which would promote increased physical activity, while reducing pain
and the risk of comorbidities. Veterans with TTAs typically use a passive-elastic prosthetic foot such as the
Össur Low Profile Vari-flex with Evo (LP) with a stiffness category based on manufacturer-recommendations,
user body mass, and anticipated activity level. Previous evidence demonstrates that Veterans with TTAs using
the recommended passive-elastic prosthetic foot stiffness category for walking have greater metabolic
demands, asymmetric biomechanics, leg and back pain, and discomfort compared to non-amputees. Further,
some Veterans use a battery-powered ankle-foot prosthesis such as the Ottobock BiOM. [The Össur Low
Profile Vari-flex with Evo (LP) is the only passive-elastic prosthetic foot that integrates with the BiOM. The LP is
utilized beneath (in-series with) the BiOM with a stiffness category based on manufacturer-recommendations,
user body mass and activity level. Then, the BiOM is tuned by adjusting nine different parameters within the
prosthesis using different software settings so that the combination of the user and prosthesis produce net
positive prosthetic ankle work equivalent to average non-amputee net positive ankle work within two standard
deviations (SD) of the mean. Use of BiOM has resulted in normative metabolic costs and biomechanics for
people with TTAs compared to non-amputees, but one study found that use of the BiOM with a recommended
LP prosthetic foot stiffness category and prosthetic power output setting did not elicit differences in metabolic
cost at preferred walking speeds compared to use of participants’ own passive-elastic prosthesis.]
 We will systematically assess how prosthetic foot stiffness and power output affect physical function in
Veterans with TTAs. First, we will quantify prosthetic and torsional stiffness (force/displacement or
torque/angle) values of LP prostheses. Determining stiffness values (in kN/m and kN·m/rad) for a given
passive-elastic prosthetic foot stiffness category is essential for deriving the dynamic biomechanical function of
prosthetic feet. Then, we will systematically measure and compare the metabolic cost, biomechanics, muscle
activity, and satisfaction resulting from using the LP passive-elastic prosthetic foot alone with four stiffness
categories, and the BiOM battery-powered ankle-foot prosthesis combined with four LP prosthetic foot stiffness
categories and three different magnitudes of prosthetic ankle power output during walking over a range of
speeds. Our results will provide a mechanistic understanding of prosthetic stiffness and power to inform
prosthetic design and control, which will improve and expedite rehabilitation of Veterans with TTAs and the
quality of services provided by the VA, while saving time, money, and resources. By improving prosthetic
design and control, our results could ultimately allow Veterans with TTAs to regain the greatest possible level
of physical function, improve their health, maximize their recovery and rehabilitation, facilitate their return to
work/duty, and potentially improve their quality of life. Long-term goals for prosthetic design should include
“smarter” prostheses that can change stiffness dynamically, generate net positive mechanical work, and
dissipate mechanical work. However, a critical barrier to developing such advanced prostheses is our lack of a
fundamental understanding of the effects of different prosthetic foot stiffness and power output on the
metabolic costs, biomechanics, and satisfaction of Veterans with TTAs during level-ground walking."
10844571,"The pattern of social connections within a population (whether a school, firm, village, or online group) is
mentally perceived by those embedded within it. Such “cognitive social networks” (the mental maps people
make of the social world around them) are relevant to people’s social, mental, and physical well-being. More
formally, a sociocentric social network defines a set of dyadic relationships between individuals in a defined
population and can be represented by a 𝑁 × 𝑁 matrix A where each element Aij represents a tie between
individuals i and j, e.g., reported by individual i. But individuals not only form mental representations of their
own relationships, they also cognize relationships between others. For instance, an individual k may have a
perception of the relationship between i and j, say, that i is a friend of j. This yields a three-dimensional network
structure with entries 𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑘 ∈ 𝑁 × 𝑁 × 𝑁, where i is the “sender,” j the “receiver,” and k the “perceiver” of the
relationship. Humans are innately interested in tracking relationships, despite the cognitive burden. Such
knoweldge is often the basis for introductions, strategic information disclosure, and accessing social support. In
an ongoing longitudinal cohort involving 24,862 people aged 12-93 in 176 villages in rural Honduras, we have
mapped real, face-to-face network ties. Pertinently, we have 4,589 participants older than 50 at baseline (in
2016). Here, in new work involving an ongoing subset of 136 villages, we will assess how people form such
cognitive social maps, how these maps vary, and how these perceptions might matter. We have four specific
aims. In Aim 1, we ascertain the actual and perceived ties among individuals in the networks of 136 villages.
We will ask each resident, in every village, about their perceptions of the connections that might exist among
40 randomly chosen other pairs of people in their village. In Aim 2, we compare the actual ties seen in village-
level social networks to the ties perceived by members of the village. Our primary hypotheses are that ties
geodesically further away from individuals will be assessed less accurately; that more socially connected
individuals will be more accurate; and that older, male, or cognitively impaired individuals will be less accurate.
In Aim 3, we assess how the accuracy of perception depends on the characteristics of the perceived tie. Our
primary hypotheses are that ties between older individuals or ties involving fewer public displays of connection
will be less well perceived by others. In Aim 4, taking advantage of a randomized experiment, we evaluate if
being better able to accurately perceive social connections in one’s village is associated with one’s ability to
spread novel information, including health information. Our primary hypothesis is that more socially perceptive
individuals will have a greater ability to spread exogenously introduced information. Our results have
fundamental implications not only for the social neuroscience of aging, but for a practical understanding of
social isolation and whether and how social cognition can affect the spread of information and behaviors."
10811680,"Project Summary/Abstract
Nicotine addiction among individuals with chronic pain is a serious public health concern with significant health-
care expenses and lost productivity. Chronic pain-associated negative affective state, such as anxiety, is a risk
factor for tobacco use. Greater chronic pain intensity increases sensitivity to anxiety, which is, in turn, associated
with increased smoking and vaping. Therefore, I hypothesize there is a neurobiological mechanism in which
chronic pain decreases mesolimbic dopaminergic signaling to causally induce a negative affective state, thereby
increasing the risk of nicotine use. To investigate this causal mechanism in the comorbidity of chronic pain and
nicotine use, I propose modeling this comorbidity in rats and the following aims: Aim 1: Evaluate ventral
tegmental area – nucleus accumbens (VTA-NAc) dopamine (DA) signaling in a model of chronic pain to
determine whether decreases in DA signaling underlie the chronic pain-induced negative affective state. Aim 2:
Determine whether nicotine has increased reinforcing efficacy in chronic pain states compared to pain-naïve
states. This proposal combines behavioral, pharmacological, neurochemical, and optogenetic approaches to
reveal whether chronic pain-associated decreases in VTA-NAc DA signaling underlie chronic pain-induced
negative affective states, and whether nicotine is more rewarding in chronic pain states compared to pain-naïve
states due to decreased baseline DA signaling, thereby exacerbating nicotine’s effects on DA signaling.
My overall career goal is to become an independent academic scientist, identifying neurobiological mechanisms
underlying these phenomena to develop new interventions for patients with co-morbid pain and nicotine
addiction. The proposed K01 trainings will increase my knowledge of neurobiology and circuitry of the mesolimbic
reward pathway, allowing me to investigate its mediation in chronic pain-induced negative affect and nicotine
addiction. My primary mentor Dr. Addy, an expert in neurobiology and neurochemistry of substance abuse and
Director of Scientist Diversity and Inclusion at Yale, will provide training on mechanisms of drug reinforcement
and in vivo voltammetry along with insight into building an inclusive and diverse work environment. My co-mentor
Dr. DiLeone, an expert in neuronal circuits controlling reward-related behaviors, will provide training on
neuromodulation and in vivo optogenetics. My co-mentor Dr. Porreca, an expert in pain-induced affective and
motivational behaviors and reward circuits, will provide training and oversight on modeling and understanding
brain reward circuitry in chronic pain and negative affect. My co-mentor Dr. Picciotto, the director of the Junior
Faculty Mentoring Program for the Department of Psychiatry at Yale, will mentor my career enhancement
trainings together with Dr. Addy. My consultant Dr. Ditre, an expert in human comorbidity of chronic pain and
nicotine addiction, will provide insights in the discussions of human data. I will also receive extensive training by
attending courses, seminars, conferences, and workshops. Through the proposed K01, I will effectively gain new
technical skills and perspectives, ultimately facilitating a successful transition to become a principal investigator."
10911077,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the common type of acute leukemia in adults, is an important health
concern for Veterans due to its high incidence and frequent poor response to treatment. Internal tandem
duplication (ITD) of the fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) receptor tyrosine kinase is present in AML cells of
30% of patients and is associated with poor treatment outcomes. FLT3 inhibitors have activity, but responses
are limited and transient, with rapid development of resistance occurring by diverse mechanisms.
 FLT3-ITD causes constitutive FLT3 signaling, which is also aberrant. In addition to activating the
PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MEK/ERK/RAS pathways, which are activated by signaling of wild-type FLT3, FLT3-ITD
activates signal transducer and activation of transcription (STAT) 5, which transcriptionally upregulates the
oncogenic serine threonine kinase Pim-1. Pim-1 contributes directly to the proliferative and anti-apoptotic
effects of FLT3-ITD, and also phosphorylates and stabilizes FLT3, promoting STAT5 signaling in a positive
feedback loop in cells with FLT3-ITD. Cells with FLT3-ITD also exhibit inactivation of the serine/threonine
phosphatase protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which has tumor suppressor activity. The transcription factor c-
Myc is transcriptionally upregulated downstream of FLT3-ITD, along with Pim-1, and knockdown of c-Myc or
Pim-1 has anti-proliferative effects in cells with FLT3-ITD. In addition, PP2A and Pim-1 both regulate c-Myc
post-translationally. We hypothesize that concurrent targeting of aberrant signaling pathways will enhance the
efficacy of FLT3 inhibitors and prevent development of resistance to FLT3 inhibitors, and overcome resistance.
 Mechanisms of acquired resistance to FLT3 inhibitors include development of point mutations in the FLT3
kinase domain, a FLT3-dependent mechanism, and of RAS mutations - a FLT3-independent mechanism.
Expression of Pim kinases is also further upregulated in cells with FLT3-ITD with FLT3 inhibitor resistance.
 Work in our prior VA Merit Award focused on cellular and molecular effects of pan-Pim kinase inhibition in
 AML cells with FLT3-ITD. Pim inhibition has little effect by itself, but potentiates the anti-proliferative and pro-
 apoptotic effects of FLT3 inhibitors and of chemotherapy drugs in cells with FLT3-ITD. We found that Pim
 inhibition enhances induction of apoptosis of AML cells with FLT3-ITD by FLT3 inhibitors in vitro and in vivo
 via post-translational downregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 and its deubiquitinase USP9X. We
 subsequently found that post-translational c-Myc downregulation precedes these changes. We also found
 that concurrent treatment of cells with FLT3-ITD with PP2A-activating drugs and FLT3 inhibitors causes
post-translational downregulation of c-Myc and Pim-1; and that these effects are mediated by AKT
 inactivation-dependent activation of GSK-3 which phosphorylates both c-Myc and Pim-1, enhancing their
 proteasomal degradation.
 The overall hypothesis of this Merit award proposal is that concurrent treatment with PP2A activating
 drugs or Pim kinase inhibitors enhances the efficacy of FLT3 inhibitors in AML with FLT3-ITD, abrogates or
delays development of FLT3 inhibitor resistance, and has the potential to re-sensitize cells with FLT3
 inhibitor resistance occurring by diverse mechanisms.
 Our Specific Aims are: 1. To test the hypothesis that PP2A-activating drugs and Pim kinase inhibitors
 increase FLT3 inhibitor efficacy through GSK-3-mediated post-translational c-Myc downregulation; 2. To test
 the efficacy of PP2A-activating drug or Pim inhibitor co-treatment in preventing FLT3 inhibitor resistance; and
 3. To determine the efficacy of Pim inhibitor or PP2A-activating drug co-treatment in re-sensitizing AML cells
 with FLT3-ITD with FLT3 inhibitor resistance occurring by diverse mechanisms.
 The long-term objective is to develop clinical trials, with the ultimate goal of improving outcomes for
patients with AML with FLT3-ITD, a common AML subtype with poor treatment outcome."

 The latest census indicates that 50+ million adults in the US bear some form of arthritis and by 2030, an
estimated 67 million Americans ages > 18 years are projected to have the diagnosis of arthritis. Osteoarthritis
(OA) represents the most common form of arthritis and is a major cause of morbidity in the aging population
but for which there are limited medical treatments and no disease modifying drugs. Although effective disease-
modifying OA drugs (DMOADs) are critically needed, none has successfully emerged in the clinic. Post-
traumatic OA (PTOA) is a form of OA that develops after a joint injury and in which the nature and time of
trauma is generally known. Approximately 12% of the overall OA burden can be traced to joint trauma. True
prevalence for PTOA may be higher, given the long delay between injury and PTOA (10-15 years). PTOA
affects 5.6 million individuals in the US. The projected lifetime risk of developing PTOA of the knee in
individuals who sustain anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture or meniscal damage is 50-70%. PTOA
accounts for 20% of all joint replacements. Veteran Health Relevance: Among the population of service
members, all causes of PTOA result in some degree of permanent disability in 28% of soldiers compared to
12% of civilians who sustain joint trauma. In addition, the frequency of arthritis among combat veterans from
ongoing US military operations is estimated at 11.8%. The diagnosis of arthritis resulting from combat-related
injury is accelerated and often accompanied by poor outcomes, requiring joint replacement at a younger age in
the veteran population compared to the general population. Thus, any intervention that shifts the curve and
decreases the risk of PTOA development will benefit the patients in the general population as well as military
service members and veterans.
 Studies have documented a robust inflammatory response in the immediate aftermath of joint injury (i.e.
during the first week up to 2-3 months) that persists for months to years, albeit at a lower level. This
inflammatory response likely contributes to chondrocyte death, impaired cartilage repair and the subsequent
cartilage degeneration that characterizes PTOA. We posit that modulation of this early inflammation limits
acute cartilage damage while delivery of an anabolic factor that promotes cartilage repair/homeostasis will
further delay or prevent eventual PTOA development. We employed a peptide-based self-assembling
nanocomplex, delivering a wide range of nucleic acids [small interfering (si)RNA and messenger (m)RNA] and
allowing for the simultaneous targeting of multiple pathways using the same cell-penetrating peptide, with no
need for backbone or end-piece alterations. We show that intra-articular (IA) delivery of our peptide-based
nanoparticle to knock down expression of NFKB mitigates early established PTOA in the Destabilization of the
Medial Meniscus (DMM) model of surgery-induced PTOA. We also demonstrate that simultaneous delivery of
NFKB siRNA and mRNA that overexpresses WNT16, a signaling pathway important for the maintenance of
cartilage homeostasis, further mitigates early established PTOA in the DMM model. To explore the unique
potential of our self-assembling peptide-nucleic nanoplatform we propose to determine the long-term outcomes
of combined anti-inflammatory and anabolic nanotherapy in the DMM model. We believe these efforts will likely
produce a disease-modifying nanotherapeutic approach for PTOA. Insight gained from these studies may be
applicable to OA treatment in general."

 Despite major advances in diagnosis and treatment, there remains a need for sustained research and
therapeutic innovation to reduce cancer burden. Besides experimental biology, the landscape of oncology
research now encompasses computational patient dataset mining for new biomarkers and therapeutic targets,
genome and epigenome analysis-based personalized medicine, and application of how sociodemographic and
socioeconomic disparities affect cancer incidence and outcomes. The next generation of researchers must
receive early exposure to this comprehensive, integrated view of modern oncology, so they can make informed
and innovative decisions regarding specialization or cross-specialization options throughout their future
education. The proposed CREATE program for future cancer researchers aims to accomplish this goal by
integrating a 10-week mentored undergraduate cancer research program with foundational modules on
computational drug discovery and development and cancer health disparities-based research. This program will
build and expand on the UMMSOM/Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center (SCCC)-sponsored pre-existing
summer program infrastructure to facilitate research projects tailored to individual scholar interest alongside
comprehensive academic and career development support. Complementarily, through a hands-on mini-project,
CREATE scholars will receive hands-on instruction in bioinformatics and computational approaches required to
develop a robust therapeutic pipeline. SCCC serves a diverse catchment area that will be leveraged to provide
CREATE scholars with unique opportunities for understanding the impact of cancer disparities at the community
level on disease incidence and treatment outcomes. Currently, only undergraduates actively engaged in
computational projects or health disparities research benefit from their exposure to these essential research
areas. Our proposed curriculum will ensure all our scholars develop a working understanding of these areas in
addition to accomplishing substantive bench research with world-class faculty mentors. CREATE scholars will
also experience clinical oncology components including physician shadowing and basic instruction in Phase I
trial design. They will receive sustained programmatic and peer mentoring support as they navigate the next
steps in their academic training. An important aspect of enhancing the cancer research workforce is outreach
and engagement with student populations who do not have research opportunities due to their location or
circumstances. SCCC is only the second NCI-designated center in the entire state of Florida. As such, our
institutional summer program receives more qualified applicants than we can support, demonstrating a clear
interest from undergraduates across the country in our cancer research resources and environment. We are,
thus, in a unique position to offer the innovative CREATE program to help produce the next generation of cancer
researchers with the comprehensive training and knowledge to succeed in oncology-based careers."
10843852,"ABSTRACT: Endometriosis is a chronic pathologic condition that affects approximately 176 million worldwide,
and can cause severe abdominal pain and subfertility. Despite its prevalence, there is currently no widely
accepted theory of pathogenesis for endometriosis. Further, there are currently no clinical biomarkers for non-
invasive diagnosis as most patients are only diagnosed at the time of exploratory laparoscopy. Thus, application
of new molecular technologies to advance the understanding, diagnosis, and intraoperative detection of
endometriosis is critically needed to improve patient care and management. Ambient mass spectrometry (MS)
techniques offer the chemical specificity and sensitivity to perform rapid and in-depth molecular analysis of
unprocessed tissue samples. We propose to conduct a rigorous study applying MS techniques in conjunction
with statistical methods to identify, characterize, and validate metabolic and protein markers of endometrial and
endometriosis tissues correlated to patient symptoms and disease presentation. Further, we propose to evaluate
the performance of ambient MS techniques as tools for rapid diagnosis of endometrial tissues, and in vivo
intraoperative disease detection. Combining our team’s expertise in MS, statistics, gynecological surgery,
pathology and endometriosis, we are unique poised to successfully carry out the following proposed aims:
Aim 1. Characterize metabolic and proteomic markers of endometriosis tissues from endometriosis
patients using MS imaging. Characterization of molecular markers that are specific to endometriosis lesions
within tissue microenvironment can lead to new understanding of the biological mechanisms governing
endometriosis development and pinpoint potential targets for treatment. Using a large cohort of tissues
prospectively collected from surgeries, we will use MS imaging and statistical analysis to identify molecular
signatures of endometriosis tissues and uncover significant molecular alterations correlated to patient
phenotypes and disease presentation within controlled patient subgroups.
Aim 2. Define diagnostic markers of endometriosis using endometrial tissues from endometriosis and
unaffected patients. New methods for accurate and rapid diagnosis endometriosis are critically needed to
advance patient care. We propose to use MS imaging and statistical analyses to identify diagnostic markers of
endometriosis using endometrial tissue samples obtained from eutopic endometrium of endometriosis patients,
and endometrium tissues from unaffected patients undergoing other benign gynecological procedures, with the
goal of identifying molecular markers that could use for diagnosis of endometriosis from tissue biopsies.
Aim 3. Test the MasSpec Pen as an intraoperative tool for in vivo endometriosis detection. Complete
excision of endometriosis lesions and preservation of healthy adjacent tissues is of utmost importance in the
surgical treatment of patients. We propose to conduct a clinical study to evaluate the performance of MasSpec
Pen technology for in vivo detection of endometriosis lesions and surgical guidance in laparoscopic procedures."

Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) consists of a series of processes that takes place in the
inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). Energy flux through OXPHOS appears to be intrinsically modulated by
the lipid composition of IMM by mechanisms that are not clearly understood. In particular, phosphatidyl-
ethanolamine (PE) is a cone-shaped non-bilayer lipid that induces membrane curvature in cristae and binds
with high affinity to mitochondrial respiratory complexes and regulate their functions. We found that
interventions that induce high OXPHOS flux are accompanied by increases in mitochondrial PE, and such
increase was sufficient to increase mitochondrial respiratory capacity. The central premise of this proposal is to
provide a comprehensive bioenergetics prognosis for altered mitochondrial PE content. Combining high-
resolution respirometry, fluorometry, electrophysiology, and microscopy, we will examine the role of PE in the
following processes: 1) Regulation of mitochondrial pyruvate entry at IMM to facilitate the Warburg effect, 2)
Origin of electron leak in the electron transport chain to induce oxidative stress, and 3) Efficiency of ATP
synthesis to alter cellular fuel economy."

The ribosome is the macromolecular machine, conserved throughout evolution, that is
responsible for the synthesis of proteins and is therefore a fundamental component of gene
expression. Because of its central role in biochemistry, the ribosome has become the target of
more than half of all antibiotics, and the evolution of antibiotic resistance due to mutations in the
ribosome has become a major threat to human health. Understanding the molecular basis of
antibiotic resistance therefore has significant implications for the fight against the threat of
resistance. In deciphering the mechanism of antibiotic resistance, fundamental insights into the
mechanism of ribosome function can also be acquired, leading to possible novel antimicrobial
agents through rational drug design. Through an ongoing collaborative effort, this proposal
capitalizes on the ability of the PIs to combine genetics and structural biology to address
fundamental questions of ribosome structure and function and provide a framework for future
development of novel antimicrobial agents. The Aims of this proposal are: (1) Dissect 30S subunit
conformational dynamics during tRNA movement through the ribosome; (2) Define the role of two
intersubunit bridges in 30S-50S rotation during translocation; (3) Determine the structural basis
for signaling pathways through the ribosome.
 Achieving these aims will involve exploiting the expertise of the three PIs to generate and
characterize functionally impactful mutants and determine their structures by X-ray
crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy. The strengths of our proposal include: (1) extensive
expertise in the experimental methods to be applied; (2) a long track record of effective
collaboration between the PIs; (3) an extensive publication track record in the field of ribosome
structure and function; (4) a large volume of preliminary data and ongoing studies, including
multiple studies nearing completion. Accomplishing these goals will significantly advance the field
by answering long-standing questions about antibiotic resistance mechanisms, while
simultaneously expanding our understanding of the basic underlying mechanism of the ribosome."

This proposal seeks to engage high-school aged youth in establishing schools as clean air environments
during and beyond wildfire season. This training and research plan will build upon Dr. D’Evelyn’s expertise in
air pollution toxicology and community based participatory research (CBPR) and prepare her for a career in
environmental health science and implementation science at the nexus of climate, health, and community
action. During the K99 mentored phase, Dr. D’Evelyn will utilize the expertise from her thoughtfully assembled
mentorship team and course-based learning to gain training in: 1) best practices in CBPR and Youth
Participatory Action Research (YPAR); 2) qualitative methodology, implementation science and evaluation; and
3) exposure science to address health equity questions in a community setting. This training will provide Dr.
D’Evelyn with interdisciplinary skills as she moves toward an academic career in independent research. Over
the course of the K99 phase, Dr. D’Evelyn will expand air quality knowledge in schools through implementation
of an air quality curriculum and a youth-led air quality monitoring network. Aim 1 will establish a permanent
monitoring network in the school community which will enable students to collect, analyze and disseminate
information about their school’s air quality with the goal of increasing education and awareness of the health
impacts of exposure to wildfire smoke. This work will build upon Dr. D’Evelyn’s previous experience working
with high school students and will enable her to translate her expertise in air pollution toxicology into an
understandable, place-based curriculum to improve awareness and student self-efficacy in smoke-impacted
communities. Educational and behavioral outcomes from this aim will be measured through observations and a
pre/post survey given to students and teachers to evaluate the impact of their involvement in the project. Upon
completion of the K99 phase of this award, Dr. D’Evelyn will move into the R00 phase in which she will
complete Aims 2 & 3 that will transition her to an independent researcher. The R00 phase will focus on air
quality interventions, implementation science, and evaluation. In Aim 2, Dr. D’Evelyn will continue to foster
youth engagement through co-development of an intervention plan that will address the specific exposure
concerns of each school community. She will then work with students and school administrators to support
implementation of this plan, utilizing the new implementation science skills and knowledge she gained during
the training phase. Aim 3 will conclude this independent phase with a full evaluation of the effectiveness of a

Health policies, educational programming, and health-related services require accurate and up-
to-date data on the sexual behaviors, attitudes, and experiences of the population. We propose
to conduct Wave 8 of the National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior (NSSHB) in order to
support such public health efforts. Sexual health is an important part of human health. Since
2014, sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates have increased annually. STIs challenge the
health of individuals and newborns, and cost billions of dollars each year. Unintended
pregnancies have decreased overall, though adolescent and young adult women are at greater
risk for unintended pregnancy as are sexual minority women. Among adolescents aged 15-19, 3
of 4 pregnancies are unintended. Sexual health has been conceptualized by the World Health
Organization (WHO) as a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to
sexuality; it refers not only to the absence of disease but also to the possibility of pleasurable
and safe sexual experiences that are free of coercion, discrimination, and violence. From
adolescence through old age, people have diverse sexual health needs. These sexual health
needs include choosing when to become sexually active with a partner, preventing unintended
pregnancy, reducing risks of HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI), accessing and using
condoms/contraception, sexual identity development, patient/provider sexual health
conversations, painful sex, vaginal dryness, sexual coercion and assault, sexual function, as
well as the development and maintenance of satisfying relationships. Since 2009, the NSSHB
has served as the nation's only U.S. nationally representative probability survey that is focused
on sexual health, assesses diverse sexual behaviors and attitudes, and samples individuals
from adolescence through advanced age (often ages 14 to 94). We have a unique opportunity
to develop the NSSHB-Wave 8 so as to maximize cross-national comparisons with other
nationally representative probability surveys of sexual health being conducted in a similar time
frame in the U.K., France, and Australia. We aim to: (1) Design and field NSSHB-Wave 8,
surveying 9500+ individuals; (2) Demonstrate the scientific and public health importance of
NSSHB-Wave 8 by updating population-prevalence of sexual health behaviors, establishing the
population-prevalence of understudied sexual behaviors, and examining associations between
certain sexual behaviors and reproductive coercion and sexual coercion; and (3) work closely
with an Advisory Board of sexual and reproductive health scientists, educators, and key leaders
to disseminate findings and to facilitate data availability to other scientists."

Hypertension (HTN) is the most significant modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and involves multiple pathways including those in the neuroendocrine and immune systems.  Antihypertensive drugs manage HTN but do not address the central sympathetic and inflammatory pathways and approximately 50% of hypertensive (HTNive) patients do not have their blood pressure (BP) controlled.  The World Health Organization has suggested acupuncture for HTN; however, prior clinical trials utilizing acupuncture have shown modest or null outcomes and not achieved clinically meaningful reductions in BP. These conflicting outcomes result from the lack of a mechanistic-based approach to using electroacupuncture (EA), a form of neurostimulation. The reasons for inadequate treatment and BP control are complex, but one reason for this therapeutic misalignment may be an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development and progression of HTN including autonomic dysfunction and resulting low-grade inflammation.  Using neuroanatomical mapping, phenotyping, and recording of neurophysiological responses that correspond to neuromodulatory mechanisms underlying effects of EA, we successfully selected specific acupoints that in combination (or combined (c)EA) show complementary mechanisms of sympathoinhibition and parasympathoexcitation and not only reduce BP to clinically meaningful levels but also improve underlying autonomic dysfunction and low-grade inflammation.  Our proposed study addresses one of NCCIH’s top priorities, “Determine and analyze the neural pathways by which acupuncture exerts its therapeutic effects.”  Our strong preliminary data, from Dahl Salt Sensitive (DSS) HTNive rats, show that our targeted acupoints, which simultaneously activate afferents in the median, tibial, and deep peroneal nerves then modulate CNS regulation by activation of neurons in the nucleus of tractus solitarius (NTS), dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV).  This modulation resulted in an increase in descending peripheral parasympathetic splenic activity.  Treatment with cEA also reduced presympathetic neuronal and splanchnic sympathetic nerve activities.   In this study, we will investigate if cEA treatment leads to BP reduction by improving autonomic dysfunction and decreasing inflammation through the neural mechanistic pathways we have preliminarily discovered.  Our main aim is to assess mechanisms of the BP lowering effect of cEA in HTNive animals and then validate the improvement in autonomic indices by translating it in mild-moderative HTNive patients.  We plan to achieve this by:  1) direct assessment of the effect of cEA on neurons in the hypothalamic and brainstem regions controlling sympathetic and parasympathetic balance including NTS, DMV, paraventricular nucleus, and rostral ventrolateral medulla, as well as sympathetic and parasympathetic efferent activities; 2) investigating if cEA reduces inflammation through acetylcholinergic receptors (AChR) activity in DSS HTNive rats; and 3) using a parallel 2x2 factorial design in a human randomized control study, primarily assess effects of cEA compared to sham-EA (as well as secondarily compare sympathoinhibitory-EA, anti-inflammatory-EA, and cEA) on physiological alterations in autonomic function and secondarily on chronic inflammation. If successful, this study would address the mechanistic basis for the effects of EA as a therapeutic option for HTNive patients who are not at optimal BP goals with conventional therapy alone."

Heterozygous truncating variants in the essential sarcomere protein titin (TTNtv) are the most common genetic
cause of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), dilatation and contractile dysfunction of one or both ventricles of the
heart. DCM often progresses to heart failure (HF), a devastating disorder associated with high morbidity and
mortality including death in 50% within 5 years after the first HF hospitalization. While an exact mechanism of
how TTNtv leads to pathogenesis of DCM is still under investigation, insufficient amount of TTN protein caused
by TTNtv significantly disrupts cardiac physiology and contributes to development of DCM. To define therapeutic
strategies for DCM caused by dominant truncating variants in TTN (TTNtv DCM), Dr. Kim first developed an
efficient model system: isogenic wild-type (WT) and mutant human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived
cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) carrying heterozygous TTNtv. TTNtv/+ hiPSC-CMs have decreased TTN
expression and impaired contractility, similar to human patients with DCM. Additionally, by comparative analyses
of sequence conservation and transcriptional activation signals during cardiomyocyte differentiation of hiPSCs,
Dr. Kim identified a transcriptional enhancer of TTN, when deleted from WT hiPSC-CMs, markedly reduced TTN
expression and disrupted sarcomere formation and function. Furthermore, Dr. Kim’s preliminary work
demonstrated that transcriptional activity of the TTN enhancer can be increased by modifying its sequences and
by directing clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-mediated activator to the TTN
locus in human cells. Based on these preliminary data, Dr. Kim formed the hypothesis that increasing TTN gene
expression by modulating endogenous TTN regulatory elements and by introducing exogenous transcriptional
activators will improve function of cardiomyocytes in TTNtv DCM model systems. In this proposal, Dr. Kim plans
to test her hypothesis in three specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, Dr. Kim will identify regulatory genetic elements
of TTN gene expression, which are currently unknown. In Specific Aim 2, Dr. Kim will modulate regulatory
elements of TTN via genome editing to augment TTN expression. In Specific Aim 3, Dr. Kim plans to assess
effects of increased TTN expression in TTNtv DCM model systems. This work will take place in the Division of
Cardiovascular Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), a core teaching hospital of Harvard Medical
School (HMS). Dr. Kim will perform the research under the mentorship of Dr. Christine Seidman, the Thomas W.
Smith Professor of Medicine at HMS and director of Cardiovascular Genetics Center at BWH, and Dr. Jonathan
Seidman, the Henrietta B. and Frederick H. Bugher Foundation Professor of Genetics at HMS. Dr. Kim’s goal is
to become an R01-funded independent clinician-scientist with expertise in genetics of cardiomyopathy. Dr. Kim
plans to use her K08 award to strengthen her skills and knowledge in gene regulation and genome editing, which
will serve as a foundation for her R01 application where she will apply genetic engineering technologies to
develop therapeutic strategies for DCM."
10849868,"The goal of this research is to understand how the retina contributes to motion processing in the dorsal
visual pathway. The neural circuitry within the retina extracts visual information and sends that
information through the axons of retinal ganglion cells to the visual thalamus and, subsequently, to the
cortex. Much is known about the neural pathways that perform motion computations in the cortex, but
far less is known about how the retina contributes to this pathway. The proposed research will further
our understanding of how the retina contributes to motion processing and the mechanisms that contribute
to this neural computation.
Our first aim will directly determine whether selectivity for object versus background motion is present in
the retina and the neural mechanisms that mediate these computations.
Our second aim will study circuits tasked with detecting the orientation and motion of visual objects.
Our third aim will test whether signals from short-wavelength-sensitive cones are utilized for neural
computations outside of classical color vision.
If successful, this research will provide several significant contributions. First, it will increase our
understanding about how ethologically relevant information is encoded in parallel neural circuits—a
fundamental goal of systems neuroscience. Second, it will explain how excitatory and inhibitory neural
networks differentially shape information flow and contribute to neural computations. Finally, these
findings will be applicable immediately to ongoing development of retinal prostheses and other
techniques designed to restore visual function in blind humans."
10828402,"Our preliminary data implicates inflamed adipose tissue as a factor that may lead to biochemical abnormalities
in muscle and attenuate some of the adaptive responses to exercise in obese individuals. The objective of this
project is to evaluate a hypothesis that adipose tissue inflammation activates inflammatory cascades in skeletal
muscle that, in turn, attenuate molecular responses to exercise.
Aim 1 will determine how adipose tissue phenotype influences skeletal muscle function and exercise
response parameters in humans. Humans with obesity will complete studies to assess molecular response
to acute exercise from protein synthesis rates, mRNA of exercise-responsive genes, and activation of signaling
proteins in skeletal muscle. Subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) will
be assessed using a combination of non-invasive imaging and biopsy-based molecular phenotyping. This aim
will determine if acute exercise response is attenuated with increasing IMAT or in people with inflamed adipose
tissue phenotype.
Aim 2 will determine the mechanisms by which SAT and IMAT secretomes influence muscle phenotype
and exercise response. Primary muscle cultures and adipose explants (SAT and IMAT) will be generated
from participants in Aim 1. Myotubes will be exposed to conditioned media from IMAT, inflamed SAT, or non-
inflamed SAT to evaluate their influence on molecular phenotype and exercise response pathways. Genetic
and pharmacological approaches will be used to target key inflammatory pathways in skeletal muscle (TLR4,
IKK, JAK/STAT) to assess their roles in exercise response in vitro.
The contribution of the proposed research is expected to be a detailed understanding of the mechanistic links
between adipose tissue inflammation, local inflammatory responses in skeletal muscle, and molecular
response to acute exercise. The knowledge gained in the proposed study will have a positive impact because
“exercise resistance” represents a significant barrier to the prevention and reversal of disease and disability in
humans, and understanding the role of anatomically distinct adipose tissue pools in skeletal muscle physiology
may lead to new approaches to enhance the beneficial adaptations to exercise in populations that stand to
benefit most. Discovering new ways to enhance training responses in people, particularly those at risk for
metabolic disorders, will have significant benefit since exercise non-responders have increased risk for
metabolic disease."

3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)
a Phase 3 clinical trials as an adjunct to psychotherapy for
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Published data show that MDMA therapy has a rapid onset and a
ability to foster feelings of social connection, empathy and trust. However, MDMA itself may not be an ideal
therapeutic, as it has a well-known potential for abuse and is associated with cardiovascular and neuro-
psychiatric toxicity. Despite these and other limitations, the apparent efficacy of MDMA suggests that directly
enhancing sociability and social reward sensitivity are feasible, potentially powerful therapeutic strategies. In
mouse models we can use MDMA as a unique probe to understand evolutionarily conserved social behaviors
with potential therapeutic relevance. Conventional approaches to understanding the mechanism of MDMA and
other psychiatric drugs, focusing on high affinity receptor interactions and select brain areas, have had limited
success at developing novel therapeutics for psychiatric disease. My lab has developed a way to define
with few assumptions about pharmacology or brain areas involved. This method, in mice,
maps brain-wide activity evoked du
for MDMA-linked behaviors. Combining social behavioral testing and imaging could be used to screen novel
therapeutics for MDMA-like profiles and provides testable hypotheses for human imaging studies with MDMA.
 MDMA releases supraphysiological levels of serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) among other
neuromodulators and evokes acute social preference, social reward learning, and nonsocial drug reward in
humans and mice. Mechanistically similar drugs that primarily release 5-HT (d-fenfluramine, FEN) or DA (d-
methamphetamine, METH) recapitulate selective components of the total MDMA effect, but neither induces
social reward learning. Here, we propose to take advantage of the overlapping yet distinct behavioral and
unique prosocial
effects. First, we compare brain-wide Fos expression maps between groups of mice under drug/environmental
conditions that
on brain-wide neural activity -like behavioral
effects. Second, we test whether activity in identified regions is required for expression of four MDMA-evoked
behaviors: acute social preference, drug craving, social reward craving and social operant conditioning. My
preliminary data demonstrates proof-of-concept: we have discovered that the dorsal endopiriform nucleus/
ventral claustrum (DEn/VC) has an obligate role in MDMA-evoked acute social preference. Third, we detail the
anatomy and connectivity of the DEn/VC, and test whether its activity can suffice to drive prosocial behaviors."
10810700,"The centromere is a unique chromosomal region that is essential for high-fidelity chromosome transmission
during cell division. In mitosis, microtubules attached to the kinetochore help ensure the faithful segregation of
sister chromatids into daughter cells. Our goal is to understand the mechanisms that govern centromere function.
Centromere identity relies on the deposition of the centromere-specific histone H3 variant, CENP-A but not on
specific DNA sequences. After DNA replication, “old” centromeric nucleosomes are transferred onto the newly
replicated chromatids. In mammals, deposition of CENP-A occurs in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The
mechanisms of CENP-A deposition and maintenance are crucial for proper centromere inheritance and function
but remain to be delineated. We recently found that EWSR1 (Ewing Sarcoma Breakpoint Region 1) is required
for CENP-A deposition and maintenance at the centromere. We show that EWSR1 and EWSR1-FLI1 (the
oncogenic fusion protein in Ewing sarcoma) bind to CENP-A through the SYGQ2 region within its prion-like
domain known to be important for phase separation. We found that EWSR1 is required for CENP-A deposition
at the centromere. CENP-A is associated with centromeric RNA, which is important for centromere function. We
demonstrate that EWSR1 plays a key role in promoting this association. We also have biochemical evidence
that EWSR1 binds R-loops, a three-stranded RNA-DNA hybrid, through its RNA-recognition motif. Based on
these findings, we hypothesize that EWSR1 plays crucial roles in maintaining centromere structure and function
by binding RNA and anchoring CENP-A in centromeric chromatin. We will test this hypothesis. Aim 1: To
determine the function of EWSR1 and RNA/R-loops in centromere maintenance. We generated EWSR1
conditional KO cells using an AID (auxin-inducible degron) system, which allows us to remove EWSR1 upon
auxin addition. We will test if auxin-induced degradation of EWSR1 abolishes CENP-A signals at the centromere
at different cell cycle stages. We will induce the expression of SETX, which clears RNA-DNA hybrids, at different
cell cycle stages to ask whether centromeric RNA/R-loops are required for CENP-A maintenance at the
centromere. Aim 2: To investigate the function of EWSR1-CENP-A interaction. We will generate EWSR1 mutants
defective in binding to CENP-A by introducing mutations into the SYGQ2 region of EWSR1. We will examine the
phenotypes of the EWSR1 KO cells expressing CENP-A binding deficient mutants. We will also identify the
EWSR1-binding domain of CENP-A. We will then isolate CENP-A mutants impaired for EWSR1 binding. We will
express Flag-tagged mutants in CENP-A KO cells to examine the localization of CENP-A and the phenotypes of
the mutant cells. We will investigate if EWSR1 association with CENP-A is unique for interphase. We will
investigate the mechanism that regulates cell cycle specificity of EWSR1-CENP-A interaction. Aim 3: To test if
EWSR1 anchors CENP-A at the centromere via RNA binding. To test this model, we will directly examine this
model by constructing and testing CENP-A and EWSR1 variants with engineered functional domains."

Classification of protein domains have historically served to contextualize the 3D structural data collectively generated by
experimental structure determination methods such as X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy,
and electron microscopy. Our database, Evolutionary Classification of protein Domains (ECOD), has served the biological
community for seven years cataloguing evolutionary relationships between domains from experimental structures. The
recent advent of high-accuracy structure prediction methods, such as AlphaFold (AF) and RoseTTAFold (RF), and the
consequent release of 1 million predicted structures in AlphaFold Database (AFDB) heralds a paradigm shift in structural
biology and domain classification. The rate of structure deposition is expected to jump between a hundred to a thousand-
fold. We propose to take advantage of this revolution and transform ECOD into a comprehensive classification of the
entire protein university using sequence, structure, and functional evidence. By simultaneously classifying experimental
and predicted structures of proteins from model organisms and human pathogens, our classification will help the scientific
community to critically evaluate structure models and utilize the evolutionary information to discover and experimentally
characterize protein function.
Classifying AF models challenges the ECOD pipeline by a 50-fold increase in the workload and by the significant fraction of
non-globular and low-quality regions in the models. Thus, our first Aim is to upgrade ECOD’s infrastructure and develop
methods to identify single domains from AF models and to integrate sequence, structure, and functional site similarities
into our automatic classification. Compared to the current ECOD workflow that relies on human experts for structure-and-
function-based classification, these improvements will drastically decrease the need for manual curation and will allow us
to achieve our second Aim, i.e., classifying domains of over 1 million released AF models into ECOD via a combination of
computational pipelines and minimal manual efforts (0.25%  1% cases). Utilizing the deluge of AF models, the new
automatic pipeline, and expertise of human curators, we expect both to significantly improve ECOD and to evaluate the
quality of AF models by (1) covering all known protein families in Pfam, (2) confirming remote homology via evolutionary
intermediates, (3) comparing evolutionarily related experimental and predicted structures, and (4) resolving errors and
inconsistency through periodic quality checks. Finally, we will take the lead in making functional discoveries for
biomedically important proteins classified by ECOD in our third Aim, studying virulence factors (VFs) in bacterial pathogens
modelled by AFDB or studied by our experimental collaborators, the Orth lab. Fast evolving VFs were a challenge for
structure prediction or functional inference by sequence. We will identify candidate VFs in two dozen bacterial pathogens,
obtain their structure models, and infer their function using similarities to known proteins in structure and functional sites.
Promising hypotheses will be tested experimentally in the Orth lab through biochemical and genetic assays."
10814253,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This work is designed to understand the mechanism of how the protein encoded by the human deafness gene,
TMPRSS3, leads to hair cell death and hearing loss. Hair cells are surrounded by apical tight junction protein
complexes, which form a barrier between the endolymph which covers the apical side of the hair cell and
perilymph, which covers the basolateral side of the hair cell. The endolymph contains a high potassium
concentration and high electrical charge, while the perilymph has low potassium concentration and low
electrical potential. Disruption of the apical tight junctions leads to permeability of endolymph K+ and death of
sensory hair cells. Variants in the multiple genes encoding tight junction proteins cause human deafness and
result in rapid hair cell degeneration during the rapid rise in endocochlear potential. This unique temporal
pattern of hair cell death mimics what is seen with variants in the gene encoding the serine protease,
TMPRSS3. Our preliminary data shows that loss of TMPRSS3 disrupts apical tight junction formation. We
hypothesize that TMPRSS3 functions to prevent hair cell degeneration by maintaining the tight junction barrier
between hair cells through proteolysis of tight junction related protein substrates. The goal of this application is
to define the biological mechanism of how loss of TMPRSS3 leads to disruption of tight junction function. In
Aim1, we will test if TMPRSS3-mediated hair cell death is dependent on the endocochlear potential in vivo and
we will determine if the location and/or proteolytic cleavage of tight junction proteins are altered in TMPRSS3-
deficient hair cells. Using immunohistochemical, biochemical and ultrastructure techniques, we will determine
how loss of TMPRSS3 physically alters tight junctions. Aim 2 we will use AAV-mediated gene delivery in vivo
to determine if TMPRSS3 function is protease dependent and if hearing loss variants TMPRSS3 are functional.
In Aim 3, we will use multiomic approaches in human stem cell-derived inner ear organoids to determine
transcriptomic and proteomic pathways regulated by TMPRSS3. By accomplishing these aims we will not only
advance our understanding of the molecular mechanism and protease substrates of TMPRSS3 in the inner
ear, but also gain insights into the dynamic regulation of tight junctions. This has the potential to impact
multiple forms for genetic deafness."

Dermal injury leads to fibrosis and scar formation, which can be a significant source of morbidity. Interestingly,
humans respond to identical skin injuries with different degrees of scar formation that range from low to high
scaring phenotypes. Understanding the mechanisms that drive heterogeneous scarring outcomes will allow us
to design strategies to direct wound healing toward regeneration and reduced scarring. Biomechanical forces
are known to influence how the skin heals. Biomechanical tension signals fibroblast proliferation, migration,
inflammatory functions and production of extracellular matrix (ECM). These responses, in conjunction with
oxidative stress in the wound, place a high energy demand on fibroblasts. Typically, metabolic requirements of
cells are met via mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) under homeostatic conditions or via
glycolysis when oxygen is limited. Recent studies have shown that increase in mechanical cues can alter energy
metabolism by promoting glycolysis. Notably, the phenomenon of a metabolic shift towards ‘aerobic glycolysis’
(Warburg effect) was mainly described in progression of fibrotic diseases, but our data showed that fibroblasts
from uninjured skin of healthy patients with high scarring phenotype (HS) have higher OXPHOS and glycolysis
than those from low scarrers, and demonstrated changes in mitochondrial function that suggest a higher energy
state at baseline. Expression of PKM2, a key rate-limiting enzyme of aerobic glycolysis, was also higher in HS
fibroblasts, with increased PKM2 phosphorylation/dimerization shunting metabolites toward increased ATP
production and promoting aerobic glycolysis and pro-fibrotic pathways under TGF-β stimulation. HS fibroblasts
also had an exaggerated response to mechanical tension, with an increase in total and phosphorylated PKM2.
These data support the concept that PKM2-mediated aerobic glycolysis in fibroblasts under tension may
influence the magnitude of fibrosis. Consistently, we also noted an exaggerated increase in phosphorylation of
Hsp27 in HS fibroblast under tension. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of differential aerobic glycolysis
and biomechanical tension responses being linked to opposing scar outcomes in physiologic wounds, which
could explain wound healing heterogeneity. We hypothesize that patient-specific scarring responses are due to
PKM2/Hsp27-dependent alterations in fibroblast aerobic glycolysis that are influenced by wound biomechanical
forces. In Aim 1, we designed in vitro and in vivo experiments with low and high scar-derived patient fibroblasts
to investigate differences in PKM2 and Hsp27 phosphorylation/activation and their effect on metabolic pathways,
energy metabolism, and ECM production. In Aim 2, we will utilize in vitro and human skin xenotransplant wound
models to examine how biomechanical tension alters PKM2/Hsp27 mediated energy metabolism to drive patient
scarring responses and then develop and validate a novel predictive model for individual scarring propensity
(low or high) based on fibroblast bioenergetic signatures. This will lead to the development of anti-fibrotic
therapies based on an individual’s metabolic profile, which could have implications for other fibrotic diseases."

 Enzymes perform amazing multielectron reductions of N2 and CO2, and for these challenging reactions they
use iron-sulfur clusters. The iron-sulfur clusters in the active sites of N2-reducing (nitrogenase) and CO2-reducing
(FeNi CO dehydrogenase) enzymes have unique shapes that are thought to generate binding sites on two
adjacent metals. The cooperative reactivity of two metals may be the key to reducing these small molecules, but
we do not yet understand how these metals work together, how they channel electrons and protons to the
substrates, and how they mediate bond rearrangements under mild conditions. Direct studies on each enzyme
have led to working models of the mechanism, but aspects of the protein crystal structures of intermediates are
confusing and sometimes contradict inorganic chemistry principles. Moving the field forward requires new iron
compounds that demonstrate what is reasonable behavior expected for these clusters.
 Our guiding hypothesis is that synthetic iron-sulfur ""model"" compounds can reveal the feasible geometries
and spectroscopic signatures of cluster intermediates. Because the synthetic compounds have known structures,
they enable us to correlate spectroscopic signatures with specific structural features. More importantly, they can
be used to test the feasibility of mechanistic steps and pathways. The synthetic model strategy will be used for
iron-sulfur and iron-sulfur-nickel compounds that contain key aspects of the active-site clusters in the nitrogenase
and CO dehydrogenase enzymes.
 Taking advantage of our long experience in the organometallic chemistry of iron and nickel, we use innovative
synthetic approaches based on bulky supporting ligands. These ligands protect active sites to enable binding of
the gaseous substrates, and proton-coupled electron transfer facilitates substrate reduction without buildup of
charge. In nitrogenase modeling, we will test a new mechanism where a preorganized multimetallic iron/sulfur
environment enables rapid proton-coupled electron transfer to N2, rapidly converting the N2 to diazene (N2H2).
Success in this aim would reveal the way that nitrogenase traps the normally unreactive N2 molecule under mild
conditions, using the coupling of proton and electron movement. In CODHase modeling, we will prepare and
study the first iron-sulfur clusters with three-coordinate nickel sites, which have great structural fidelity to the
proposed enzyme active site. We will experimentally evaluate their redox chemistry, spectroscopy, and reactivity
with CO2 and other compounds, in order to test the feasibility of mechanisms proposed in the enzyme.
 By studying chemistry relevant to both these iron-sulfur enzymes, we will gain generalizable knowledge about
how hydrogen bonding, proton-coupled electron transfer, sulfur donors, electron migration, and multimetallic
cooperativity enable biological systems to process small molecules. Further, this understanding contributes to
the future ability of chemists to reduce N2 and CO2 for use in energy science."
10819527,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are finely tuned signaling molecules that are central to diverse
neurophysiological processes and serve as major drug targets for neurological and psychiatric disorders. A major
form of GPCR regulation occurs through the action of multifunctional β-arrestins (β-arrs) which bind to activated
receptors to drive functional desensitization, control receptor trafficking, and initiate G protein-independent
signaling cascades. Despite progress, our mechanistic understanding of GPCR/β-arr coupling is limited and
based on a small number of prototypical family A GPCRs. It is critical to improve our understanding of GPCR/β-
arr coupling by unraveling the biophysical basis and biological consequences of variability between different
GPCR subfamilies and subtypes, as well as between different pharmacological ligands.
 The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) form an eight-member family of family C GPCRs with a
unique architecture consisting of large extracellular, ligand binding domains that mediate constitutive
dimerization. Due to their roles in synaptic neuromodulation, mGluRs have emerged as drug targets for
neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, and psychiatric disoders, as well as cancers. However, it has been
difficult to harness mGluRs therapeutically because of a lack of understanding of their basic signaling
and regulatory properties. Deciphering the mechanisms of mGluR regulation is particularly challenging since
this subfamily is dramatically expanded by heterodimerization and is targeted by a broad panel of orthosteric
and allosteric ligands with distinct properties. Until recently, mGluR/β-arr coupling has been poorly characterized,
but we recently found that a subset of mGluRs is capable of robust β-arr coupling while others are highly resistant,
providing another dimension of molecular diversity to this GPCR family.
 We will build on our recent findings with a battery of structural, biophysical, and cell-based
measurements, to understand the underlying mechanisms and physiological consequences of mGluR/β-arr
coupling. In aim 1, we will develop and harness a single molecule imaging assay to define the determinants and
stoichiometry of mGluR/β-arr complex formation and then use electron microscopy (negative stain, cryo-EM) to
solve high resolution structural snapshots of mGluR/β-arr complexes. In aim 2, we will use in vitro and live cell
biophysical assays to define the basis of mGluR C-terminal domain and transmembrane core coupling to β-arrs
across subtypes and probe the effects of distinct ligand types and heterodimerization on mGluR/β-arr coupling.
In aim 3, we will investigate the trafficking and functional consequences of mGluR/β-arr coupling using high-
resolution optical and proximity proteomics techniques in both cell lines and cortical neurons, with a focus on
presynaptic signaling and trafficking. Together, this project will provide a full picture of the regulation of mGluRs
by β-arrs, providing a deeper understanding of this critical receptor family and gaining broader insight into
GPCR/β-arr coupling."
10839439,"Adoptive cellular therapies (ACT), including the two modalities: Engineered T Cell Receptor (TCR) Therapy
and Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T Cell Therapy, are currently at the forefront of cancer immunotherapy.
While CAR-T therapies has gained clinical success in the treatment of hemopoietic cancers and are approved
by FDA, the clinical efficacy for treatment of solid tumors has not been confirmed. In contrast, TCR-T Cell
therapies seem more promising for solid tumors, though a main barrier is the disarmament and suppression of
the engineered T cells by the fibrotic tumor stroma that contains stiff and structurally-complex extracellular
matrix (ECM), cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and various immune cells such as tumor associated
macrophages (TAMs). With intensive ongoing clinical investigations on the TCR-T cell therapies that
outnumbers the studies on CAR-T therapy, there is an urgent need to understand the mechanism of interaction
between TCR-T cells and the tumor stroma. The objective of this project is to dissect and understand the
mechano-immunological interaction between TCR-T cells and the fibrotic tumor stroma for improved TCR-T
cell immunotherapies. The main hypothesis is that the anti-fibrosis strategies can reduce tumor-associated
fibrosis and enhance the ability of TCR-T cells to overcome the immunosuppressive microenvironment, thus
leading to improved therapeutic efficacy. The research team consists of a medical scientist who pioneered a
two-pronged TCR-T cell therapy (super T cell) that targets tumor antigen NY-ESO-1 and blocks
immunosuppressive TGF-β signaling at the same time and is under clinical trials funded by NIH and DoD. The
second team member is a biomedical engineer who is specialized in the organotypic modeling of fibrotic
diseases and anti-fibrosis drug development. In the current study, novel microphysiological tumor stroma niche
models will be developed to investigate the interaction between TCR-T cells and the fibrotic stromal factors
with and without the combination of anti-fibrosis therapies. The aims include investigating the competing effect
of fibrotic factors on the TCR-T cells to determine the dominant fibrotic factors that suppress the TCR-T cell
functions, modeling the dynamic fibrosis progression in the tumor stroma and investigate the different effect of
fibrosis inhibition, degradation and blockade on the functions of the TCR-T cells and investigating the
mechanism and efficacy of combined anti-fibrosis therapy and TCR-T cell therapy. This project is innovative
because the study to dissect the mechanism by which tumor fibrotic stroma suppresses the transgenic TCR-T
cells will help to identify the therapeutic targets for the design and optimization of future fibrosis-targeting T cell
therapies. The comparison between NY-ESO-TCR-T and Super T cells will directly benefit our ongoing clinical
study and help with the evaluation of these therapeutic T cells. It is expected that the combination of anti-
fibrosis therapies with TCR-T cell therapy will lead to new avenues of anti-cancer therapy that can become the

Obesity and type 2 diabetes are increasing dramatically worldwide. Recent data has shown that obesity rates
have more than doubled since 1980 and if these trends continue unabated, by 2030 estimates predict that
approximately half the U.S. population will be obese, with 25% developing type 2 diabetes. Adipose tissue is
an important site for initiation and aggravation of obesity and type 2 diabetes because it is a key endocrine
organ that functions to maintain energy homeostasis, and recent studies have identified lipokines, or signaling
lipids, released from adipose tissue as molecules that can mediate metabolic effects. One class of these
lipokines are oxylipins, oxidized lipid metabolites that exert metabolic effects. An important oxylipin for
metabolic control is the linoleic acid metabolite 12,13-diHOME, which is released from brown adipose tissue
(BAT) in response to cold and exercise in rodents and humans and beneficially impacts glucose and fatty acid
metabolism. 12,13-diHOME increases fatty acid uptake into brown adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and
cardiomyocytes, and is negatively correlated with circulating triglycerides and BMI in humans. However, due to
its very short half-life, systemic regulation is difficult to maintain and thus its therapeutic potential has not been
fully realized. To address this essential issue, we developed a paradigm-shifting approach to increase 12,13-
diHOME via tissue nanotransfection (TNT), a non-viral gene delivery technology with high translational
potential. TNT delivery of the genes Ephx1/2, coding for the enzymes that make bioactive 12,13-diHOME
results in a sustained systemic increase of 12,13-diHOME in circulation and corresponds to reduced adiposity
and improved metabolic health. In these proposed studies we will optimize a therapeutic upregulation of
Ephx1/2 via TNT in pre-clinical models and comprehensively establish the physiological ramifications of a
sustained systemic increase in 12,13-diHOME and provide new therapeutic approaches to combat obesity and
type 2 diabetes. We will do this using the following two specific aims: 1) Determine the effectiveness,
efficiency, and mechanisms through which TNT-based delivery of Ephx1/2 into the skin increases 12,13-
diHOME in circulation and; 2) Determine the physiological ramifications of a sustained increase in the oxylipin
12,13-diHOME by TNT. The proposed studies have the potential to provide paradigm-shifting results and
elucidate novel mechanisms to sustain oxylipin up-regulation and providing new therapeutic approaches to
combat obesity and type 2 diabetes."

 Dr. Rebecca Muhle is a practicing child psychiatrist and an Early Stage Investigator with a strong track record
of developing molecular genetic tools to elucidate the mechanism of neurodevelopmental disorders. Her long-
term goal is to identify cell types, circuits and regulatory networks affected by loss of Chromodomain Helicase
DNA-binding Protein 8 (CHD8), a high confidence autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk gene. Dr. Muhle initiated
her studies of CHD8 during her fellowship with James Noonan, Ph.D. with co-mentorship by Matthew State,
M.D., Ph.D. She successfully obtained research funding from the National Institute for Mental Health and the
Simons Foundation for Autism Research to determine the impact of CHD8 and its loss on regulatory networks
of the developing cortex, and she showed that CHD8 in developing cortex regulates other ASD risk genes.
 She is extending this research at Columbia University in collaboration with Jeremy Veenstra-VanderWeele,
M.D. and Muhammed Osman Chohan, M.D., experts in translational animal models of neurobehavioral disorders
and the study of monoaminergic neurotransmission. Together, they have found reduced stereotypy and
attenuated hyperlocomotor activity in male, but not female Chd8+/- mice after inhibition of the dopamine
transporter, with an intact response to dopamine receptor agonism, suggesting that CHD8 plays a critical role in
the development of the dopaminergic circuit between the midbrain and striatum. The overall objective of this R01
proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms whereby CHD8 genetic mutations affect cells and pathways critical for
core symptoms of ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders, by integrating state-of-the-art single nuclear
transcriptomics and cell type specific functional genomics with electrophysiologic and behavioral probing of
animal models with a loss of CHD8 expression.
 The following three independent specific aims will address the central hypothesis that CHD8 regulates genes
that are critical for the function of the basal ganglia and dopaminergic system, and that loss of CHD8 will
dysregulate these genes and other ASD risk genes. This project will 1) identify the cellular, transcriptional, and
epigenetic changes in the developing Chd8+/- mouse ventral midbrain and striatum using single nuclear RNA
sequencing (snRNAseq) and chromatin accessibility (snATACseq), 2) elucidate how CHD8 loss causes a defect
in the molecular transmission of the DA stimulus in the basal ganglia using fiber photometry and in vivo
extracellular recordings using constitutive and conditional CHD8 haploinsufficiency mouse models, and 3)
localize CHD8 binding activity in specific cell types of the dopaminergic system using chromatin
immunoprecipitation and sequencing of a conditionally biotinylated Chd8-tag transgene. By studying CHD8, a
key regulatory molecule that targets other ASD risk genes, Dr. Muhle will close a critical knowledge gap in the
role of CHD8 in the circuitry implicated in ASD-related behaviors."
10838553,"Santa Ana in Orange County (OC), California (CA) is a predominantly Latina/o, immigrant and low-income community
that is bound by multiple freeways, has a large industrial corridor, and has 65% of houses built prior to 1960. Residents of
Santa Ana have identified lead (Pb) exposure in the community as a major environmental health concern. Responding to
the concerns, we established the ¡Plo-NO! Santa Ana! (Lead-Free Santa Ana!) community-based participatory research
partnership to examine elevated Pb levels in urban soil in Santa Ana since 2017. In this study, we propose to address the
community-identified concerns of lead exposure and its impact on children’s health and academic performance using a
community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach. We will also address important gaps in previous Pb research
and practice, including 1) limited consideration of both life course exposure and susceptible time window for chronic low-
level Pb exposure; 2) lack of research based on repeated outcome measures; 3) few studies on synergistic effect of metal
mixtures; 4) few studies on multi-level (e.g. household, school, neighborhood) intervention; and 5) lack of community-
driven research devoted to translating knowledge to effective public health equity strategies. Our overarching goal is to
examine associations of life course and current Pb exposures with children’s academic performance and neurobehavioral
outcomes, identify risk factors of current Pb exposure, and develop and implement a Public Health Equity Action Plan
(PHEAP), with particular attention to health equity. Study population involves 600 children 7-10 years old at
enrollment and their primary caregiver. Individual-level exposure to Pb and other metals will be estimated from 1)
deciduous tooth-based exposure at a weekly resolution from the 2nd trimester of gestation up to the 1st year of life and
every 6-months from age 1 up to the time when the tooth is shed; 2) blood for current exposure. Repeated outcomes
include 5 years of academic performance and 3 years of behavior outcomes based on validated Child Behavior Checklist
(CBCL) questionnaire. We will examine associations of academic performance and behavioral outcomes with deciduous
teeth-based early life Pb exposure (Aim 1) and current blood Pb exposure (Aim 2). Further, we will develop, disseminate,
implement, and evaluate a multi-level (e.g. household, school, neighborhood, city, county) Public Health Equity Action
Plan, with a focus on equity (Aim 3). The strengths of this study include: bridging CBPR and implementation science by
leveraging results from Aims 1-2 of this study and practice-based evidence to inform the PHEAP, responsiveness to
community-driven priorities, strong community and university leadership, life course measurements of Pb and metal
mixtures, a large prospective cohort with longitudinal measurements of both exposure and outcomes, and multiple levels
of assessments (i.e. household, school, neighborhood) that advance the science on environmental health inequities to
develop, evaluate, and pilot action plans and community-driven interventions. We will advance knowledge on how low
levels of Pb exposure over the life course adversely affect children’s school performance and behavioral outcomes. The
translational value of this study is noteworthy, as it integrates etiologic data and practice-based evidence to an equity-
oriented multi-level action strategy to improve child academic and neurodevelopmental outcomes."

Household air pollution (HAP) from solid fuel use causes an estimated 400,000 chronic obstructive pulmonary
(COPD) deaths each year. Although lung function and lower respiratory disease in childhood are determinants of
COPD risk later in life, there are few studies of the influence of early life HAP exposure on respiratory health later
in childhood. We propose a HAP study design that is sensitive to emerging chronic respiratory effects by
incorporating three key features: 1) assessment of exposure during early life windows of susceptibility, 2) a strong
exposure contrast introduced by a randomized intervention, and 3) sensitive endpoints that predict chronic
disease later in life. Gestation and infancy are critical windows of susceptibility due to the rapid lung development.
Previous HAP intervention trials had only low to moderate effectiveness for reducing HAP exposure. The
Household Air Pollution Intervention Network (HAPIN) trial (2017-2021) offers a time-sensitive, unique research
opportunity because the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) stove and fuel intervention lowered median gestational
fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure in Guatemalan participants by 77%, from 98 to 23 µg/m3. The intervention
continued until age 1 year and extensive health data were collected, including pneumonia incidence and severity.
We have maintained follow-up of the cohort post-intervention, assessing HAP exposure and child growth at age 2
years plus lung function at age 3 years. We posit that childhood lung function and lower respiratory disease
episodes are sensitive indicators of HAP health effects that relate to adulthood COPD. DNA methylation (DNAm)
and pneumonia during infancy may influence these respiratory endpoints later in childhood. We propose to
leverage our successful LPG cooking intervention in Guatemala to investigate effects of early life HAP exposure
on longer-term respiratory health and explore DNAm as a biomarker. We hypothesize that the randomized LPG
cooking intervention and lower PM2.5 and black carbon (BC) exposure will be associated with DNAm at age 1 year
and greater lung function and fewer lower respiratory disease episodes at age 4-7 years. Aim 1. Estimate effects
of a randomized LPG cooking intervention during gestation and infancy (age <1 year) (Aim 1.A) and HAP
exposure (PM2.5 and BC) during and after the intervention (Aim1.B) on lung function trajectories (age 3-7 years)
and lower respiratory disease incidence (ages of 4 to 7 years). Aim 2. Estimate effects of a randomized LPG
cooking intervention (Aim 2.A) and HAP exposure (Aim 2.B) during gestation and early infancy (age <1 year)
on DNAm biomarkers at the end of the intervention period (age 1 year). Aim 3. Determine whether DNAm at age
1 year (Aim3.A) and pneumonia episodes until age 1 year (Aim 3.B) are associated with lung function
trajectories and lower respiratory disease incidence between ages of 3 to 7 years. Effects of early life HAP on
lung function and lower respiratory disease later in childhood would have important implications for the early life
origins of COPD in populations exposed to HAP, and identifying epigenetic changes that might underpin this
relationship could lead to improved research and interventions."

Copy number variations (CNVs) of the human 16p11.2 genetic locus, containing 29 coding genes, are associated
with a number of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. The deletion (16pdel) and duplication (16pdup)
variants of this region have poorly understood pleiotropic effects. Although autism is more common in patients
with deletions, and schizophrenia is more common in those with duplications, underlying mechanisms are not
clear. Several molecular pathways from the 16p11.2 region modulate neuronal differentiation, migration, axonal
development, and synapse formation, as well as energy and lipid metabolism. Studies of 16p-animal models
have suggested deficits in the KCTD13-RhoA pathway activation, neuronal migration, axonal development, and
behavior. In turn, disruption of ceramide homeostasis due to 16p11.2 CNVs at FAM57B locus altered lipid
abundance, cell membrane dynamics, synaptic protein expression, and synaptic transport, suggesting that
lipidome dysregulation could contribute to neuronal function and activity. However, the exact molecular
mechanisms underlying these neuronal dysfunctions in excitatory versus inhibitory neurons are lacking.
Moreover, contradictory results have been reported from different animal and human cell models. To address
this gap of knowledge, we developed human iPSC-derived neuronal models of 16p11.2 CNVs and demonstrated
that i) KCTD13 regulates RhoA pathway activation, and increased RhoA expression leads to hyperactivity of the
16pdel human cortical neuron networks, and ii) there are significant changes in key mitochondrial and lipid
enzyme transcripts, including decrease in FAM57B-mediated ceramide synthase expression, that directly
correlate with observed changes in the metabolome and lipidome. These data suggest that 16pdel leads to
complex metabolic disruptions and deficient ceramide expression that might contribute to the observed functional
neuronal network phenotypes. These data have led us to hypothesize that 16p11.2 CNVs cause dysregulation
of ceramide abundance in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons that in turn promotes deficits in synaptic
development and function leading to network disorganization and hyperactivation. Here, we will investigate this
hypothesis and the effects of 16p11.2 CNVs on cortical neuron development and function in human iPSC-derived
2-dimensional excitatory-inhibitory neuron co-cultures and human iPSC-derived 3-dimensional forebrain
organoids. To reduce variability caused by different genotypic backgrounds, we will study CRISPR-Cas9 induced
16p11.2 CNV iPSC lines in addition to iPSC lines derived from patients and healthy controls. We will utilize state-
of-the-art molecular methodologies to uncover mechanisms underlying the synaptic dysfunction of the excitatory-
inhibitory neurons in 16p11.2 CNVs, including single cell transcriptional gene expression profiling and
lipidome/metabolome profiling. Finally, we will investigate the excitatory-inhibitory network function, connectivity,
and oscillation patterns with multi-electrode arrays and patch clamping. We anticipate that this study will uncover
new molecular targets related to cortical neuron dysfunction in 16p11.2 CNV disorders."

 Gastrointestinal (GI) complications cause significant morbidity among patients with systemic sclerosis
(SSc), and mortality is high in severe disease. Within SSc GI diseases, constipation can be particularly significant,
culminating in recurrent pseudo-obstruction, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, megacolon, and/or the
requirement of total parenteral nutrition to sustain life. Despite the negative influence on quality of life and
association with poor outcomes, the factors that cause SSc-constipation are not well-understood. This presents
clinical challenges because patients with SSc-constipation may have similar symptoms but experience variable
responses to therapy. Importantly, recent data suggests that distinct physiological mechanisms of constipation
may distinguish SSc-constipation subgroups. For instance, inadequate anal muscle relaxation is associated with
dyssynergic defecation (DD), while abnormal neural control is hypothesized to drive rectal hyposensitivity (RH)
and slow colonic transit (SCT). Our group and others have found that symptoms of autonomic nervous system
(ANS) dysfunction are present in SSc associate with more severe GI dysfunction. As the ANS coordinates colonic
transit and contains sensory pathways which trigger timely defecation, it is plausible that ANS dysfunction may
disrupt normal colorectal mechanisms and cause SCT and RH in SSc.
 In order to determine whether ANS stimulation improves colorectal physiology in SSc-constipation, we
developed a convenient, well-tolerated intervention, known as transcutaneous electrical acustimulation (TEA) that
enhances nervous reflexes and promotes bowel motility and evacuation in patients with constipation mediated
via ANS pathways. Our prior studies demonstrate that TEA enhances parasympathetic activity and improves SCT
and RH in constipated patients without SSc. In a pilot study, we also determined that TEA significantly improved
GI symptoms after 2 weeks in patients with SSc-constipation. Finally, our data also suggest that TEA improves
ANS function and suppresses inflammatory cytokine production (e.g. IL-6), which associates with improvement
in the balance of vagally-mediated inflammation and GI symptoms. We hypothesize that SSc-constipation is
driven by distinct, clinically-relevant mechanisms, and that TEA will enhance ANS function to improve SCT and
RH.
 To test this hypothesis, we will first determine the prevalence of RH, SCT, and DD among symptomatic
patients with SSc-constipation using comprehensive objective GI testing. We will then interrogate the responses
of GI physiology to a 4-week home-based noninvasive TEA in symptomatic patients with SSc-constipation.
Finally, we will examine the mechanisms of TEA as they pertain to autonomic function and inflammation. This
work will 1) determine the relative contributions of RH, SCT, and DD to SSc-constipation; and 2) identify the
subgroups where autonomic dysfunction is involved. This work is not only relevant for SSc, but also for other
rheumatic diseases where GI complications and ANS dysfunction co-exist."

Protein detection and biomarker profiling have wide-ranging significance in many areas of disease prognostics,
diagnostics, and therapeutics. For example, the progression and development of various cancers are
accompanied by alterations in specific protein expressions. These variations in different biofluids are indicative
of disease-like conditions. A long-standing difficulty of existing methods is the detection of multiple proteins in a
complex biological sample with high sensitivity and a broad dynamic range. In addition, scalable protein
identification and quantification techniques are usually created with sacrificed sensitivity, so their applicability in
clinical settings remains limited. To overcome these fundamental and technical shortcomings, we will develop,
optimize, and validate a next-generation class of sensing elements for targeted protein biomarker detection at
single-recognition event precision. These proposed studies aim to engineer synthetic sensors made of a
single-polypeptide chain protein nanostructure. This protein nanostructure encompasses a membrane protein
pore and a programmable protein binder. The protein pore is a reporter that generates an output signature,
which depends on the identity and quantity of the biomarker. A programmable binder is a small antibody-
mimetic scaffold, such as a monobody or an affibody, sampling the targeted biomarker in solution. Hence, a
generic binder can be modified for multiple protein analytes. This way, such a modular design significantly
expands the utility of these sensing elements for numerous biomarkers while preserving their high sensitivity
and specificity using the resistive-pulse technique. This critical benefit is facilitated by the genetically encoded
nature of these sensors so that they can form combinatorial libraries of tethered binders. These manipulations
of modular pore-based detectors equipped with antibody-mimetic binders have not been conducted previously.
They are intended for use in challenging biofluids, where specific binder-biomarker interactions will be
unambiguously distinguished from nonspecific interactions of the medium constituents. Further advantages of
this real-time and label-free technology include maintaining an amplified signal-to-noise ratio in a wide dynamic
range due to the superior bandwidth of time-resolved electrical recordings. The expected immediate outcomes
of these proposed studies will be the following: (i) development, optimization, and validation of monobody- and
affibody-based sensors for protein detection; (ii) protein biomarker detection in multiplexed and high-
throughput formulations; (iii) protein biomarker detection in heterogeneous solutions. These results will
represent a platform for fingerprinting panels of multiple protein targets in biofluids without impairing the
sensitivity of these determinations. This proposed research will impact quantitative proteomics and biosensor
technology by providing a fundamental basis and tools for ultrasensitive biomarker detection."
10844405,"Circadian rhythms are fundamental for understanding biology: they date to the origin of life, are found in
virtually every species from cyanobacteria to mammals, and coordinate many important biological functions from
the sleep-wake cycle, to metabolism, to cognitive functions. Circadian rhythms are equally fundamental for health
and medicine: diet modifications have been linked to molecular-level changes in circadian rhythms; disruptions
of circadian rhythms have been linked to health problems ranging from depression to learning disorders to
diabetes, to obesity, to cardiovascular disease, to cancer, and to premature aging; finally, a large fraction of drug
targets have been found to oscillate in a circadian manner in one or several tissues. A better understanding of
circadian oscillations at the molecular level has many direct applications to precision health and medicine.
 To illuminate circadian oscillations at the molecular level, modern high-throughput technologies are being
used to measure the concentrations of many molecular species, including transcripts, proteins, and metabolites
along the circadian cycle in different organs and tissues, and under different conditions. Yet informatics tools for
processing, analyzing, and integrating the growing wealth of molecular circadian data are not yet in place.
 This effort will fill this fundamental gap by continuing to develop and disseminate informatics tools to
enable the collection, integration, and analyses of this wealth of information and lead to novel and fundamental
insights about circadian oscillations' organization and regulation, roles in health and disease, and future
applications to precision medicine. Specifically, via close collaborations among computational and experimental
scientists, this effort will have four main aims: (1) Data: Aggregate the largest possible collection of circadian
omic (e.g., transcriptomic, metabolomic, proteomic) experimental datasets covering as many species, cells,
tissues, organs, and conditions (e.g., genetic, epigenetic, environmental) as possible. (2) Analysis: Develop
analytical tools, including deep learning tools, to analyze these datasets to identify molecular species with a
periodic concentration profile with statistical determination and conduct integrated differential analyses across
the different datasets. (3) Web Platform: Import the analyses' datasets and results into an integrated database
and serve them publicly through a web server (CircadiOmics platform) as a one-stop shop for viewing or
downloading circadian data, annotations, tools, and analyses, enabling other scientists to view and analyze
circadian data comparatively. And (4) Applications: Apply the CircadiOmics platform's datasets and tools to
specific biomedical problems via multiple efforts in collaboration with other experimental labs to identify the role
of circadian oscillations in health and disease and generate mechanistic molecular hypotheses that can then be
tested in the lab. One example of such collaboration is the study of the interplay between Alzheimer's disease
and circadian rhythms. All data, software, and results will be freely available for academic research purposes
and broadly disseminated through multiple channels to benefit the biomedical community and society at large."
10827977,"This investigator's proposal describes a 5-year project designed to study mesenchymal stem cells derived from
inducible pluripotent stem cells as a treatment modality for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). NEC is a devastating
intrabdominal emergency in the neonatal population that often requires the surgical resection of intestine, thereby
leaving infants with a suboptimal length of bowel to absorb nutrition. It occurs in roughly 10% of preterm infants,
carries a 40-50% mortality rate, and costs $1.3 billion in medical costs annual. There has been lack of
advancement in treatment modalities over the last decade for NEC, and cellular therapy may provide beneficial
improvements in outcomes. Investigators hypothesize that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a key paracrine factor in
mesenchymal stem cell mediated intestinal protection during necrotizing enterocolitis. To more readily study the
effects of hydrogen sulfide, they propose the development of a near infrared H2S specific probe to more
accurately quantify H2S in biological systems. Further proposed studies overexpress hydrogen sulfide producing
enzymes in iPSC derived MSCs and aim to identify the secreted polysulfides which likely serve as intracellular
signaling molecules. Finally, they assess the role of Cys440 on eNOS as a critical residue that interacts with
hydrogen sulfide to promote mesenteric vasodilation and improved clinical outcomes in experimental NEC. The
investigators propose three Specific Aims: 1) To define the role of hydrogen sulfide signaling from MSCs during
cellular therapy for NEC, 2) To develop and validate a hydrogen sulfide probe to effectively measure H2S in
biological systems, and 3) To evaluate the interaction of iPSC derived MSCs, H2S, and Nitric Oxide (NO) on the
mesenteric endothelium during experimental NEC.
The investigator is a pediatric surgeon scientist who was formally funded through the NIDDK as a K08 awardee.
This grant support expired in May 2022. He is now seeking out his first R01 award as an Early Stage Investigator.
His career goals are to use this R01 to further develop cellular therapy as a viable treatment for necrotizing
enterocolitis. Dr. Markel has a long standing collaborative and mentor relationship with Dr. Ken Olson at Notre
Dame/IU Southbend. He is an international expert in hydrogen sulfide signaling and will continue to assist Dr.
Markel with assays designed to further quantify the secreted polysulfide pool. Dr. Markel has also collaborated
with Dr Ben Gaston at his local institution who is an expert on nitric oxide signaling, as well as Dr. Tim Lescun,
a large animal veterinarian at Purdue University, who has assisted in establishing a piglet model of NEC in Dr.
Markel's laboratory.
In summary, this research aims to understand the mechanism that iPSC derived MSCs use to provide
protection in NEC. The proposal is highly innovative and the investigator has the appropriate support,
collaborations, and infrastructure in place to carry out the study. Results of this study will be used to provide
final preclinical data before human clinical trials can ensue."
10857033,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cervical cancer is one of the most preventable cancers and when diagnosed early and appropriately treated, the
likelihood of survival is close to 100%. However, nonattendance at abnormal follow-up appointments reaches
63% among urban, underserved minority women. Cervical cancer prevention and timely diagnosis requires that
patients be monitored over time. Existing intervention protocols to promote attendance have significant
limitations given a limited focus on urban, underserved minority women and reduced sustainability in resource-
limited settings. To fill this void, we propose a tailored mHealth intervention available in both English and Spanish
targeting follow-up attendance for abnormal test feedback at 3 urban clinic sites serving predominately low-
income minority women. We propose a hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial that is theoretically-
guided by the Cognitive-Social Health Information Processing model and the Exploration, Planning,
Implementation and Sustainment Implementation Framework to operationalize and assess the efficacy of the
Health Enhancement Resource System (HERS) intervention. HERS aims to increase patient follow-up after
abnormal test results through text message-based barriers counseling for women and supplemental telephone-
based Health Coaching for women who miss their appointment. Using a sequential, multiple assignment,
randomized trial (SMART) design and stakeholder-engaged approach our aims are to: (1) conduct a randomized
control trial (RCT) using the SMART design to evaluate the efficacy of HERS; (2) qualitatively assess the
contextual factors (patient factors, healthcare team resources, and organizational factors) affecting HERS
implementation outcomes and potential for scalability and sustainability; and (3) explore patient-level moderators
of the relationship between the HERS intervention and attendance at the colposcopy appointment. Women
(N=546) scheduled for initial or repeat colposcopy following an abnormal test result will be recruited and
randomized to one of 2 conditions (HERS text messages or Standard of Care) and, through the SMART design,
will remain in their assigned group or re-randomized to HERS or HERS + Health Coaching, depending on initial
appointment attendance. The primary outcome is attendance at the baseline colposcopy and the secondary
outcome is long-term follow-up at 12-months. Additional research questions will evaluate the best initial
intervention (e.g., Standard of Care or HERS) for increasing attendance at the baseline and 12-month follow-up
appointments. In-depth interviews with healthcare stakeholders and exit interviews with patients will assess the
impact of team and healthcare system context on the HERS implementation. Finally, exploratory analyses seek
to identify moderators of intervention effect (e.g., race/ethnicity, Spanish or English language, health literacy) at
baseline and 12-month follow-up appointments to evaluate which patients should receive the HERS intervention
as a first-line intervention rather than Standard of Care."
10825604,"SUMMARY
Development of novel therapeutics targeting cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying health disparities is
among the top priorities of Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC). Our thoracic
oncologists have been actively treating lung cancer patients with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) drugs with
up to 30% efficacy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We found that Black lung cancer patients
showed significantly better response to ICB than White patients, suggesting that disparities experienced by Black
patients could be overcome with ICB. Given ICB-resistance over time, we posit that increased efficacy could be
achieved through novel ICB and targeted combination therapies. Our preliminary single-cell RNA sequencing
(scRNAseq) studies show more infiltrating exhausted CD8+ T cells and fewer myeloid and natural killer cells in
NSCLC biopsies from Black compared to White patients. In tumors from Black patients, exhausted CD8+ T cells
expressed high levels of CTLA-4 and CD137(4-1BB), suggesting a possible beneficial response to ICB by
reversing the pool of exhausted T cells to restore anti-tumor function. Transcriptional pathway analysis of
scRNAseq data also identified redox and lipid metabolism as top altered molecular changes. Based on these
findings and published data showing redox- and lipid-mediated regulation of immune cell reprogramming, we
propose two central hypotheses: (a) In Black NSCLC patients, unique features of redox and lipid metabolism
give rise to dysfunctional immune cell ecosystems that underlie health disparities, and (b) these can be exploited
by innovative redox and lipid metabolism-targeting therapeutics to further improve response to ICB. Lung cancer
is the most frequent cancer diagnosis at WFBCCC. Among patients seen at our Cancer Center, 14% are Black,
and epidemiologic data collected by our Office of Cancer Health Equity show that Black patients in our region
have lung cancer incidence and mortality rates 15.1% and 15.5% higher, respectively, than rates among Black
patients in the U.S. We are in a unique position to investigate the molecular events that lead to differences in
ICB responses by Black lung cancer patients and to develop effective therapeutic strategies to overcome health
disparities. We will achieve these goals through three Specific Aims: 1) To generate high-resolution spatial
single-cell expression profiles of tumors and the tumor microenvironment in Black and White patients with
NSCLC; 2) To generate supporting data linking specific genomic events in NSCLC from Black patients to
reprogramming of redox and lipid metabolism; 3) To generate pre-clinical data demonstrating that targeting
mitochondrial redox and lipid metabolism can reshape the tumor microenvironment and improve response to
ICB. We will use NSCLC patient-derived organoids and cell lines in humanized mouse models to determine
whether MCL1 inhibitors (AZD5991 or VU661013) and Devimistat (CPI-613) can reprogram the tumor
microenvironment and improve response to ICB. Results from the proposed research will inform future study
directions and guide potential clinical trials aimed at reducing cancer disparities in Black NSCLC patients."
10854796,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Increased intraindividual variability (IIV) in task performance is a robust symptom of attention deficit/hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD). However, while theoretical frameworks suggest inefficient neural processing as a potential
cause of IIV, evidence is limited because IIV is typically measured using summary statistics of behavioral
outcomes, such as response time variability (RTV). Not only are such measures limited by sparse temporal
sampling, but they also aggregate time, ignoring underlying dynamics, and limiting the specificity and thus the
translational value of IIV in ADHD. In this project, we propose that neurophysiological measures of neural
processing efficiency can be continuously derived from the oscillatory and signal properties of EEG, to track the
contribution of top-down signals (low-frequency power), network efficiency (low-frequency oscillatory small-world
index) and network interaction stability (signal complexity). These measures can be used as a continuous, within-
subject neurophysiological index of neural processing efficiency, and one that bridges summary statistics derived
from reaction times and underlying network dynamics.
To test this idea, we revisit three existing datasets (n=514) that include children and adults, with and without
ADHD, and that contain EEG and concurrent EEG and fMRI, collected during sustained attention tasks. In each
dataset, we compute continuous measures of neural efficiency based on EEG signals to, in Aim 1, differentiate
between alternate neurophysiological profiles and mechanisms of IIV in ADHD and test if these predict
performance outcomes and individual differences in symptoms. In Aim 2, we additionally test if neural
efficiency measures predict, within-subject, aberrant interactions between core attention networks and
those previously associated with ADHD – namely fronto-parietal, default-mode, ventral/dorsal attention, visual
and fronto-striatal. The goal of the present work is to establish the neurophysiological basis of IIV in ADHD, and
thus speak to putative clinical targets of IIV, differentiate between current theories of IIV, as well as to validate
EEG-based neural efficiency as an effective intermediate indicator of underlying network dynamics."

Outcomes for patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remain poor despite
recent therapeutic advances, particularly in the area of immunotherapy. Classification of solid tumor
microenvironments as immune “inflamed” or “non-inflamed” through bulk transcriptional profiling enriches for a
subset that is checkpoint blockade therapy (CBT) responsive. Conversely, the DLBCL immune landscape has
not been as well-characterized, and the extent to which immune environmental features can predict for
immunotherapy response in DLBCL patients is unknown. Given that a growing number of immunotherapies are
being explored in the relapsed/refractory DLBCL space, a deeper understanding of the DLBCL immune
landscape might uncover clues that aid in identifying patients likely to benefit from checkpoint blockade and/or
CAR T cell therapies. Additionally, growing evidence indicates that cancer cell-intrinsic alterations can
profoundly affect the tumor immune environment, which directly impacts immunotherapy sensitivity. How
recurring genetic alterations and related pathways in malignant B cells contribute to shaping the DLBCL
immune environment is unclear. Additional research is clearly needed in order to address these gaps in
knowledge. Toward that end, we incorporated curated immune- and cell-of-origin (COO)-related gene sets into
a gene set variation analysis (GSVA) on transcriptomes of 874 DLBCL specimens. Among the four clusters
that emerged (germinal center B cell (GCB) hot, GCB cold, activated B cell (ABC) hot, and ABC cold), analysis
of whole exome sequencing data revealed significantly enriched genetic alterations in each. For instance, loss-
of-function (LOF) mutations in SOCS1, a negative regulator of JAK/STAT signaling, were enriched in GCB hot
DLBCLs, suggesting these lymphomas may be particularly sensitive to IFNγ signaling and vulnerable to anti-
PD-1 therapy. Conversely, LOF alterations in TMEM30A, which regulates phosphatidylserine (PS) orientation
in the plasma membrane, were common among ABC cold DLBCLs, which may render these lymphomas
sensitive to immunotherapies that enhance macrophage phagocytosis. These observations support the central
hypothesis that lymphoma cell-intrinsic mechanisms contribute significantly to shaping unique DLBCL immune
environments, the characterization of which will identify patients who will or will not benefit from CBT or CAR T
cell therapy. The main objectives of the proposal are: 1) to determine mechanisms by which select genetic
alterations in lymphoma cells shape the DLBCL immune environment, and 2) to develop a DLBCL “immune
score” and determine its utility in identifying patients for whom PD-1 blockade or CAR T cell therapy will be
effective. The principal investigator, a physician-scientist with clinical expertise in lymphoma and a research
background in cancer immunology, is well-suited to oversee the experiments proposed in this application. In
order to execute computational aspects of the proposal, the principal investigator has recruited a rising star in
the field. Together, their complementary skills will ensure successful completion of the planned research."
10896420,"The liver is near-unique among the body organs in its ability to extract glucose and store it as glycogen under postprandial conditions, as well as to maintain a substantial rate of glucose production under fasting or hypoglycemic conditions. Our previous work has clearly shown that a morning period of hyperinsulinemia enhances hepatic glucose uptake and glycogen storage during an afternoon hyperinsulinemic hyperglycemic clamp mimicking a second meal. The goal of our current proposal is to identify factors influencing meal responses that can be utilized in improving the care of those with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will determine which aspect of morning hyperinsulinemia (direct effects on the liver or indirect effects brought about by insulin’s impact on the brain and/or fat tissues) is the key element involved in enhancement of afternoon hepatic glucose uptake. Furthermore, in Aim 2 we will determine the importance of the route of insulin delivery (intraportal vs peripheral circulation) in the morning on the afternoon response. This question is highly relevant to the treatment of those with insulin-dependent diabetes since most of the currently available insulin therapy involves delivery by a peripheral route. In addition, we will determine what factor or factors in the afternoon response are most clearly impacted by morning hyperinsulinemia (Aim 3). We will utilize the conscious, chronically catheterized dog model which is near-unique in that it not only makes possible the delivery of glucose and insulin into the portal circulation, the usual route of entry for ingested nutrients and secreted insulin, but also permits sampling from the hepatic and portal veins to allow the assessment of the liver’s response to the treatments. Importantly, the canine model has been shown to display many physiologic responses very similar to those in the human. The innovative aspects of the proposed experiments include the fact that the model allows us to clearly separate factors that may impact the response to the initial and subsequent meals of the day and examine the effect of each factor individually. The proposed studies are highly significant because the knowledge gained through these experiments has great potential to contribute to the development of new therapeutic approaches, more accurately tailored to bring about normal nutrient disposition, for those with impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes) and diabetes."
10897825,"PROJECT SUMMARY
With antibiotic resistance mechanisms spreading rapidly among disease-causing bacteria, our ability to treat
common infections is becoming increasingly difficult. To combat resistance, we desperately need new antibiotic
agents possessing novel modes of action. Natural products, also called secondary metabolites, are small
molecules produced in nature. Secondary metabolites play pivotal roles in many cellular processes and
represent some of the most important pharmaceutical agents in human health care. This especially holds true in
the antibiotic arena as a majority of the clinically prescribed antibiotics are natural products or derivatives thereof
and have been isolated primarily from soil-dwelling bacteria. In recognition that microorganisms have been the
most prolific source of new antibiotics, this project turns back to Nature to exploit the completely unexplored
hypersaline microbes in the Great Salt Lake as a resource for drug discovery. Our observations are that
environmental pressures influence the structural diversity of compounds produced in Nature and microorganisms
thriving in extreme environments often produce chemical agents not observed in their terrestrial counterparts.
The Great Salt Lake, also recognized as “America's Dead Sea”, is an endorheic (fully isolated) hypersaline lake
located near the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, Utah. While seawater has an average salinity of ~3.3%, the
Great Salt Lake ranges between 8-28%. Our preliminary data demonstrate that the unexplored hypersaline
microorganisms of the Great Salt Lake possess antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive
bacterial pathogens, produce metabolites containing molecular scaffolds never before observed, and their
genomes contain unprecedented biosynthetic machinery. Thus, these microbes serve as an ideal resource for
the discovery of new antimicrobial agents possessing novel modes of action. To access and develop these
agents, we have developed an integrated project that will leverage the strengths of our collaborative team
including expertise in natural products isolation and structural elucidation, microbial biochemistry, genome
mining, bioinformatics and bioengineering of recombinant natural products. From this project, unique antibiotic
agents can be discovered along with information defining their biosynthetic pathways, their molecular targets,
and likely other mechanisms of drug resistance. To exploit this novel resource, our specific aims will focus on:
1) Creating a hypersaline microbial library from sediment collected from the Great Salt Lake and screening the
isolates using innovative methods for antimicrobial activity; 2) Identifying and validating new antibiotic agents
using chemical and molecular networks; and 3) Identifying the biosynthetic machinery and molecular targets of
the newly discovery antibiotic agents using genomic and bioinformatic approaches."

10911017,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
The overall goal of our research is to develop novel strategies to treat secondary complications of acute kidney
injury (AKI). Remote acute lung injury (ALI) is a frequent and often lethal complication of acute kidney injury (AKI)
that lacks therapies. Molecular mechanisms of AKI-ALI are incompletely understood, but circulating inflammatory
cytokines, e.g. tumor-necrosis-factor (TNF) and T cells have been implicated. Which specific kidney cell types
release and which lung cell types or immune cells are targeted by these mediators is unknown. Macrophage
accumulation in the lung has been reported in AKI-ALI in mice and human, but whether this occurs by recruitment
of bone marrow-derived circulating CCR2+monocytes or proliferation of tissue resident macrophages is
unknown. Macrophage responses as well as their heterogeneity are critical determinants of tissue responses to
injury. The overall lung remote immune response to AKI and the origin and heterogeneity of lung macrophages
in AKI-ALI are unknown. The objective of this application is to determine the role of proximal tubule cell (PTC)-
derived TNF and of TNFR1 in lung interstitial macrophages in AKI-ALI, to determine the origin and heterogeneity
of kidney/lung macrophages after AKI, and to compare local and remote injury responses in kidney and lung
after AKI. Our central hypothesis is (1) PTC-derived TNF is an AKI-ALI mediators and (2) local and remote
immune responses share common features but have important differences. Our preliminary work suggests that
PTC-derived TNF mediates inflammation and CCR2+-dependent interstitial macrophage recruitment to the lung,
and targets lung interstitial macrophages. We detect similarities in local and remote injury responses, but also
significant differences, e.g in response of the lung to AKI vs. to acute myocardial infarction. The rationale for this
project is that completion will (1) identify PTC-derived TNF as an AKI-ALI mediators, and lung interstitial
macrophages as its target cell in the lung, and (2) identify common features and significant differences in local
and remote immune responses that could be exploited for targeted therapies. We plan to test our central
hypothesis with two specific aims: AIM 1: Determine the role of PTC-derived TNF and of TNFR1 interstitial
macrophage knockout in AKI-ALI (using cell type-specific KO mice) AIM 2: Determine the origin of interstitial
macrophages in AKI-ALI and their heterogeneity, and compare local kidney immune cell responses to remote
lung immune cell responses in AKI-ALI (using fate-mapping and scRNAseq). As outcomes, we expect that TNF-
PTC-KO protects against AKI-ALI, and that comparison of local and remote injury responses identifies important
differences. This contribution is significant because it is expected to have translational impact in the development
of treatments for secondary AKI complications with high mortality, such as AKI-ALI. Our research is innovative,
in our opinion, because, it would for the first time identify the source (PTC) and target cells (interstitial
macrophages_ of AKI-ALI mediators in the kidney, and for the first time use single cell RNAseq to define local
and remote immune responses AKI-ALI."

10908282,"ABSTRACT
Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is an invariably fatal autosomal recessive lipid storage disorder affecting all
ages. Patients develop a clinically heterogeneous phenotype that includes severe, progressive
neurodegeneration, hepatomegaly, and early death. NPC is commonly caused by loss-of-function mutations in
the NPC1 gene (95% of cases), encoding a multipass transmembrane glycoprotein required for exporting
unesterified cholesterol from late endosomes and lysosomes. Despite our emerging understanding of the role of
NPC1 in intracellular cholesterol trafficking, a diagnosis of NPC remains particularly bleak. There are currently
no FDA-approved disease modifying therapies and patients most often die in childhood, reflecting both gaps in
our current knowledge of disease pathogenesis and a significant unmet medical need. Our long-term goal is to
contribute toward the development of disease-modifying therapies for NPC patients. The next step in attaining
this goal is to pursue the overall objective of this application: to define critical targets in CNS disease
pathogenesis that can be exploited by drug development efforts. Our central hypothesis is that NPC1 deficiency
causes toxicity in both neurons and oligodendrocytes that underlies NPC neuropathology. Moreover, we
hypothesize that this toxicity can be rescued by novel therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing the intracellular
lipid storage that is characteristic of the disease or by correcting the misfolding of mutant NPC1 protein. These
notions are based upon robust preliminary data supporting our model of NPC pathogenesis and the use of
innovative therapeutic approaches to rescue disease phenotypes. We will use genetic, biochemical, histological,
and phenotypic analyses to: establish the extent to which neuronal lipid storage and toxicity are rescued by
optimized synthetic HDL nanoparticles (Aim 1); determine the role of oligodendrocyte lineage cells in NPC
neuropathology (Aim 2); and establish effects of proteostasis regulators in humanized NPC1 model systems
(Aim 3). These studies are expected to establish that targeting intracellular lipid storage using optimized sHDLs
and modulating mutant NPC1 proteostasis will ameliorate disease phenotypes. Moreover, we expect to
demonstrate an important, yet under-studied role for oligodendrocyte lineage cells in NPC neuropathology."
10881726,"In Veterans, cancers of the colon and rectum rank third in incidence behind those of the prostate and lung; about
one-third of Veterans diagnosed with colon cancer will die, primarily from metastatic disease. However, the
molecular events underlying the spread of colon cancer remain uncertain and current treatments for advanced
disease are limited and provide only transient benefit. More effective, durable treatments are urgently needed. With
previous VA Merit support, we found M3 muscarinic receptor (M3R) activation promotes colon cancer progression
by many adverse actions. Our new findings reveal that two muscarinic receptor subtypes, M1R and M3R encoded
by CHRM1 and CHRM3, are overexpressed early in the colon cancer continuum and in colon cancer stem cells
(CCSCs) which drive tumor resilience, relapse, and metastasis. These findings suggest concurrently targeting M1R
and M3R directly may have great translational potential. Accordingly, we propose to test the central hypothesis that
selectively targeting muscarinic receptor subtypes attenuates colon cancer progression and resistance to therapy.
To do so, we must fill key gaps in knowledge regarding how M1R and M3R expression is regulated in colon
neoplasia and identify the individual roles of M1R and M3R in driving cancer progression. Our new data reveal that
as neoplasia progresses, M1R expression is progressively reduced compared to M3R expression; in most colon
cancers M3R levels greatly exceed those of M1R and we could not detect M1R in CCSCs at the tumor invasive
edge. Notably, we identified a reciprocal relationship between M1R expression and that of two microRNAs, miR-
107 and miR-103, predicted by computational analysis to interact with the CHRM1 3’-UTR. These findings are
consistent with miR-107/-103 suppressing CHRM1 mRNA translation in advanced cancer, thereby damping M1R
levels. As miR-107/-103 can also amplify β-catenin signaling, which targets CHRM3, these miRNAs may indirectly
augment M3R levels. Increased levels of M3R may also result from reduced expression of miR-30-5p which can
interact with the CHRM3 3’-UTR and has an inverse relationship with M3R levels in colon cancer. Intriguingly, our
new findings also show colon cancers also express a circular (circ)RNA, cTFRC, capable of ‘sponging’ miR-107 / -
103; and, thus indirectly regulating M1R and M3R levels by reducing levels of free miR-107 and miR-103 – we
propose to leverage the therapeutic potential of circRNAs. Building on these new findings, we propose to use
sophisticated in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo models to perform a meticulous, focused investigation of the post-
transcriptional regulation of M1R and M3R expression by these non-coding RNAs and learn how modulating M1R
and M3R levels impacts important preclinical endpoints – tumor growth, spread, response to chemo- and
immunotherapy, and animal survival. To accomplish these goals, we propose two comprehensive Specific Aims:
 Aim 1: Rigorously test the effects of selectively depleting and inactivating M1R and M3R on colon cancer
 progression, responses to chemo- and immunotherapy, and survival.
 Aim 2: Define the exact roles of miR-107, -103, and -30-5p as regulators of M1R and M3R levels and
biomarkers for colon cancer progression, and the therapeutic potential of circRNA sponges.
 As muscarinic receptors are selectively druggable by inhibitors already FDA-approved for other indications, we
believe demonstrating the therapeutic benefits of modulating muscarinic receptor activity in animal models that
mimic human disease will spur clinical trials of such agents repurposed to treat colon cancer. Identifying a novel
microRNA/circRNA/muscarinic receptor axis linked to colon cancer progression will be a major conceptual advance
whose therapeutic promise is exemplified by our newly proposed circRNA sponges for miR-107/-103."
10808109,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Aggressive behavior is a transdiagnostic indicator of both youth and adult psychiatric disorders and a
significant public health concern due to the direct harms to victims and its broader economic impact.
Nonetheless, prediction of aggressive behavior is challenging due to significant variability in how, why, and
when people act aggressively. This heterogeneity impedes efforts to establish etiological factors, identify
biological substrates, and develop uniformly effective treatments. Though theories of aggression emphasize
that it is a context-dependent, dynamic interpersonal behavior, research rarely attempts to study aggression in
the contexts where it normally occurs and is most consequential (i.e., daily life). The current project seeks to
improve on past research by studying the transdiagnostic mechanisms of aggression using novel analytic and
measurement methodology necessary for pursuing a personalized medicine approach in aggressive behavior
research and prevention. This project will use real-time data capture in conjunction with state-of-the-art analytic
methods to deconstruct the heterogeneous behavioral phenotypes that relate to aggression. To achieve this,
we will use relevant passively-sensed and self-reported data via smartphones from a sample of young adults
(age=18-30; N=150) diagnosed with mental and behavioral disorders and at elevated risk for aggression. Data
will be collected over the course of a 3-week ambulatory assessment protocol. We will apply machine learning
methods capable of uncovering and modeling the complex dynamic processes observed in aggression at the
level of each individual (i.e., personalized models) to prospectively predict aggressive urges and behavior. The
results will pave the way for scalable just-in-time adaptive interventions tailored to an individual’s specific
antecedents of aggression. The proposed study will contribute to NIMH Strategic Priorities 3.2 by 1) focusing
on personalized models that can accommodate the complex topography of aggression and its antecedents and
2) applying innovative computational approaches (i.e., machine learning) to multiple streams of data (passively
sensed, self-report) to identify potential just-in-time intervention targets for aggressive individuals. The
comprehensive research and training plan detailed in this proposal will allow this candidate to address the
primary research questions of the proposal and develop the expertise necessary to be an independent
scientist. Specifically, this candidate will receive training in 1) personalized models of psychopathology and
aggression; 2) methods for carrying out EMA-based studies and modeling intensive longitudinal data; and 3)
collecting, processing, and predictive modeling with passive sensor data. This candidate has assembled a
team of expert mentors (Wright, Jacobson) and consultants who possess the expertise to supervise the project
and provide the training necessary to support the candidate in his development as an independent scientist.
The expertise of the mentorship team, and the resources offered by the University of Pittsburgh, place the
candidate in an ideal position to achieve his training, research, and career goals."
11167327,"T cells are greatly impacted by their environment, interacting with neighboring cells that may attract,
stimulate, inhibit, and otherwise alter T cell activity. Examining multicellular tissue organization is thus required
for unraveling the T cell anti-tumor response. Yet, little is known about what multicellular networks exist in
cancer, how they are organized, and how they modulate T cell activity. This project explores the mechanistic
basis of a tumor immunity multicellular network (hub) discovered in the candidate’s (Dr. Jonathan Chen) recent
single cell transcriptomic study of human colorectal cancer. The objective of this proposal is to investigate the
composition, spatial organization and function of this immunity hub in relation to the anti-tumor T cell response.
This proposal aims to (1) spatially map cellular interactions in the immunity hub that may shape T cell behavior
and (2) identify environmental factors in the immunity hub shaping CXCL13+ CD8 T cell state and uncover the
role of CXCL13 in CRC. The candidate anticipates these studies will demonstrate that the newly discovered
tumor immunity multicellular network recruits tumor-specific T cells, and that multiple cell types within the hub
participate in shaping the state of these T cells. Furthermore, this investigation of the immunity hub is likely to
identify promising strategies for therapeutic manipulation.
 The candidate, Dr. Jonathan Chen, is currently a postdoc in the lab of Dr. Nir Hacohen and an
Instructor in the Department of Pathology of the Massachusetts General Hospital. The proposal incorporates
specific technical skills that will be required for the project, including training in analysis of ultra-highplex RNA
in situ hybridization datasets. The structured career development plan includes training and mentorship in
laboratory management, scientific leadership, research communication, grant writing, and other critical career
skills. These technical and career skills will be acquired under the guidance of Dr. Nir Hacohen, who will serve
as primary mentor and has a history of trainees obtaining faculty positions in academia, and Dr. Eli Van Allen
as computational co-mentor. A Research Advisory Committee of world-class scientists including Drs. Arlene

10832081,"Abstract: Progressive difficulty in performing everyday functional activities is a key diagnostic feature of
dementia syndromes. However, not much is known about the neural signature of functional decline, particularly
during the very early stages of dementia. Early intervention before overt impairment is observed offers the best
hope of reducing the burdens of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias. But to justify early intervention,
those at risk need to be detected earlier and more accurately.
Decline in complex daily function (CdF) such as managing medications has been reported to precede
impairment in basic activities of daily living (e.g., eating, dressing). Our goal is to establish the neural signature
of decline in CdF during the preclinical dementia period. Gait is central to many CdF and community-based
activities.2,3 Hence, to elucidate the neural signature of CdF, we validated a novel electroencephalographic
(EEG) approach to measure gait-related brain activation while participants perform complex gait based
functional tasks. Our hypothesis is that dementia-related pathology during the preclinical period activates a
unique gait-related EEG pattern that predicts subsequent decline in CdF. We provide preliminary findings
showing that older adults endorsing CdF limitations can be characterized by a unique gait-related neural
signature: weaker sensorimotor and stronger motor control activation. This subsample also had smaller brain
volume and WMH in regions affected early by dementia and engaged in less physical exercise.
We propose a prospective observational cohort study in cognitively unimpaired older adults with and without
subclinical Alzheimer’s disease (plasma amyloid-β [Aβ]) and vascular (white matter hyperintensities [WMH])
pathologies. Our aims are to 1) establish the unique gait-related EEG activation as the neural signature and
predictor of decline in CdF during the preclinical dementia period; 2) determine associations between
dementia-related pathologies and incidence of neural signature of CdF; 3) establish associations between a
dementia risk factor, physical inactivity, and the neural signature of CdF.
By establishing the clinical relevance and biological basis of the neural signature of CdF decline, we aim to
improve prediction during the preclinical stages of Alzheimer’s diseases and other dementias. Our approach
has important research and translational implications because gait-related EEG protocols are relatively
inexpensive and portable, and predicting CdF decline may have real world benefits.

Somatic mosaicism (SM), i.e. the presence of cells with somatically acquired mutations, is a driving feature of
cancer and several developmental diseases. However, whereas today we have detailed understanding and
predictive models of benign and pathogenic inherited polymorphisms, germline de novo mutations, and tumor
mutations, we have only limited knowledge of the burden, allele frequency spectrum, clonal patterns, and
mutational signatures of healthy somatic mosaicism. Realizing that such currently missing knowledge is critical
for informing experimental design in future studies of mosaicism’s biological and clinical consequences, NIH is
launching an ambitious initiative, the Somatic Mosaicism across Human Tissues (SMaHT) project to construct a
comprehensive human somatic mosaicism atlas. As part of this initiative, funding announcement RFA-RM-22-
011 calls for Tool Development Projects to develop “approaches that significantly improve the sensitivity,
accuracy, and threshold of detection of all types of somatic variants across the complete genome”. Such
comprehensive detection is currently challenging because somatic mosaicism mutations occur across a wide
range of mutation types and lengths, but the majority of today’s variant detection tools have low sensitivity for
larger, structural events. Furthermore, somatic mutations are typically at very low allele frequency (<1%), but
accurate detection of low-frequency variation today is beyond the capabilities of most tools. We have pioneered
a unique-kmer guided detection approach in our RUFUS tool, designed for germline de novo mutation detection.
This approach focuses on identifying the novel DNA sequence created by a mutation, which allows the same
underlying algorithm, with uniform algorithmic behavior and sensitivity, to be applied across the full range of
mutation types. RUFUS has been validated for accurately detecting germline de novo mutations in large
discovery datasets and rare-disease diagnostic studies. Our preliminary analyses also indicate that RUFUS has
high sensitivity across a full range of somatic mutations. This application proposes to adapt the RUFUS
algorithm for somatic mosaic mutation detection with high sensitivity and specificity across the entire
mutation type, mutation length, and allele frequency spectrum; and thus, substantially contribute to the
construction of a comprehensive mosaicism atlas. To achieve this overall goal, in the first (UG3) phase of
the project we will focus on algorithmic development to improve low-frequency allele detection, empirically
characterize RUFUS’s sensitivity and specificity, and ready the tool for adoption into the SMaHT Network’s
central analysis pipelines. In the second (UH3) phase of the project, we will integrate RUFUS into the central
analysis workflow of the SMaHT consortium; optimize and extend its performance for analyzing the vast SMaHT
somatic mosaicism dataset. We anticipate that RUFUS will contribute substantially to the SMaHT Initiative's goal
to comprehensively map out human somatic mosaicism across individuals, organs, and tissues."

trachomatis
Abstract
Chlamydia trachomatis is a clinically important obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen and the
leading cause of preventable infectious blindness (trachoma) and bacterial sexually transmitted
diseases worldwide. If not cleared, then chlamydial infections can lead to poor health
consequences, such as pelvic inflammatory disease and tubal factor infertility in women. Despite
its devastating impacts on human health, much of C. trachomatis pathobiology remains unknown.
Whereas the characteristics of the developmental cycle of C. trachomatis are well studied, the
regulatory pathways and mechanisms remain poorly defined, undermining fundamental
understanding of C. trachomatis pathogenesis. It is extremely challenging to study essential
genes, whose disruption leads to lethality. To address this gap, we have successfully adapted
CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) gene silencing technology, which relies on inducible expression
of catalytically inactive variants of dCas orthologs that repress gene transcription at a specific
chromosomal locus in C. trachomatis. This approach allows for creation of conditional, reversible
knockdowns in individual genes that can also be complemented by including a plasmid-encoded
copy of the targeted gene as a transcriptional fusion with the dCas ortholog. Building on these
findings, we have further adapted our CRISPRi approaches to allow for multiplexed gene
knockdown for the targeted knockdown of multiple genes simultaneously. The objective of the
proposed study is to develop a next generation of CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) genetic editing
toolbox in C. trachomatis and to explore its utility towards elucidating the underlying mechanisms
of developmental gene regulation. In Specific Aim 1, we will establish an adaptable second
generation of CRISPRi platform, which enables tunable, trackable, and quantitative assessment
of CRISPRi-mediated changes in C. trachomatis cellular and molecular phenotypes in single cells.
In Specific Aim 2 we will test our hypothesis that a set of “known” and “unknown” genes are
essential for critical events of ending replication of reticulate bodies (RB) and RB differentiating
to the infectious elementary body (EB). Leveraging CRISPRi, this Aim will elucidate the relative
contributions of each essential gene product to C. trachomatis developmental processes critical
for EB formation and reinitiation of a new cycle of infection. Collectively, this innovative research
project will seek a focused investigation to illustrate what chlamydial factors are crucial for, and
how these factors directly contribute to, regulation of the late developmental cycle of C.
trachomatis. It is also significant, as the methods developed will be the starting point towards
interrogation of genome-wide studies of gene function and genetic interactions in C. trachomatis."

Articular cartilage in load-bearing joints is a resilient tissue, yet 32 million Americans suffer from osteoarthritis
(OA), characterized by the progressive degeneration of cartilage. Disease-modifying therapies to prevent carti-
lage degeneration are unavailable and urgently needed. Mechanical factors heavily influence chondrocyte met-
abolic activities and play a critical role in cartilage homeostasis and degeneration. Chondrocytes are the
unique post-mitotic cells expressing both Piezo1 and Piezo2 mechanosensitive channels robustly. Since the
discovery of Piezo1 and Piezo2 in 2010, it has been identified that Piezo1 and Piezo2 exhibit distinct gating
properties, expression patterns, and mechanotransduction signaling mechanisms in human physiology and
pathology. We and others reported that Piezo1 and Piezo2 in chondrocytes sense injurious loading, and pre-
treatment with GsMTx4, a pan Piezo1/Piezo2 blocking peptide, significantly reduced the injury-induced chon-
drocyte death in vitro. Ironically, our preliminary data reveal the augmented Piezo1 in arthritic conditions and
the up-regulated Piezo2 by exercise. Also, our preliminary data show that chondrocytes in injured knees are
more susceptible to mechanical injury, but exercised cartilage are less vulnerable to mechanical injury than
controls. Thus, our central hypothesis is differential roles of Piezo1 and Piezo2 in chondrocyte mechanosensi-
tivity and cartilage homeostasis. A significant knowledge gap exists in understanding Piezo1- and Piezo2-me-
diated mechanotransduction mechanisms of chondrocytes in the context of joint health and disease. In this
program, we will take advantage of mouse models to delineate the role of Piezo1 and Piezo2 in chondrocyte
mechanotransduction, metabolism, and cartilage homeostasis. Our custom-built platforms, a mechano-micro-
scope and impact loading devices, will be employed to quantify cellular mechanosensitivity in a culture system
or in situ. A successful outcome will provide insights into OA pathology and therapeutic strategies targeting Pi-
ezo1- and Piezo2-mediated mechanotransduction for cartilage degeneration and regeneration."

New approaches to understanding BK channelopathies at the molecular level of single channels.
Mutations in KCNMA1 BK potassium channels produce a wide range of channelopathies which include epilepsy,
dyskinesis, autism, multiple congenital abnormalities, intellectual disability, developmental delay, axial
hypotonia, ataxia, cerebral and cerebellar atrophy, bone thickening, tortuosity of arteries, malformation
syndrome, and others. We suggest that the majority of studies that seek to understand the biophysical basis of
these BK channelopathies have not been studying the predominant channels; we plan to do so. The majority of
these channelopathies arise in individuals who are heterozygous for the mutant gene. Since BK channels are
tetrameric, composed of four like subunits, mutant subunits could assemble with wild-type (WT) subunits to form
an ensemble of channels with different stoichiometries. The vast majority of the ensemble channels (88%) would
be heterotetrameric hybrid channels containing a varied number of mutant subunits (from one to three). However,
these hybrid channels are typically overlooked, and the mutations found in channelopathy patients have usually
been studied in the laboratory by expressing only the mutant subunit in a laboratory expression system.
Assuming random assembly of subunits, the purely mutant channels would not represent more than 6% of the
channels found in the cells of a heterozygous patient. Based on these incomplete studies many mutations were
categorized into gain-of-function (GOF) or loss-of-function (LOF) categories due to the findings of enhanced or
reduced activation of BK channels, respectively based on homotetrameric mutant channels. We suggest that the
omission of studying the full palette of channel types present in these patients has led to a chaotic and inaccurate
categorization of phenotypes by not recognizing that most aberrant channels in these patients may be hybrids
which constitute the majority of the aberrant channels in heterozygous channelopathies. In Aim 1 using a
combination of electrophysiological techniques including single channel analysis, we propose to show that a cell
carrying one mutant and one WT KCNMA1 allele expresses an ensemble of BK channels dominated by hybrid
channels assembled from both mutant and WT subunits. In Aim 2 we will determine the functional properties
and gating mechanisms to determine how the predominant channel forms associated with BK channelopathies
(as determined in Aim 1) alter channel activation. In Aim 3 we will test the hypothesis that some genetic variants
of BK channels result in a truncated subunit that leads to a reduced amount of BK current in cells when
heterozygous with WT subunits. Although these variant genes circulate in the population they are not reported
to cause neurological disease when heterozygous. Nevertheless, these mutations need to be studied because
reduced BK currents could confer a furtive genetic pre-disposition to neurological disease. These aims will then
characterize the actions of BK variants at the molecular level of single channels for all expressed channel types,
providing information key towards understanding the channelopathies."

Periodontitis is a male-dominant, heterogeneous, inflammatory disease of the bone and tissues
supporting the tooth. It is one of the most prevalent non-communicable chronic diseases, with
~50% prevalence in the American population. Currently, there are no adjuvant therapies available
to treat the 20-25% of “hyper-inflammatory” patients that progress to tooth loss despite
appropriate standard of care. In support of this current proposal, inflammasome modulation has
been proposed to treat several inflammatory diseases. Inflammasome is required for processing
of pro-interleukin (IL)-1, pro-IL-18, and Gasdermin-D into their mature, functional forms. Despite
the common knowledge that IL-1 is sexually dimorphic and a marker for periodontal
inflammation, its role as a direct driver of disease development in both females and males is not
clear. We find that inflammasome activation has both a protective and destructive effect on
periodontal tissue that is differentially regulated between the sexes. Our data suggest the
existence of sex-based distinct pathways of periodontal bone loss. This study will expand our
current knowledge on the role of inflammasomes in periodontal inflammation and tissue
destruction in females and males. We propose to build upon our findings to develop the below
aims: Aim 1: Define the impact of biological sex in inflammasome activation during periodontal
disease development and progression. Aim 2: Define the relationship between inflammasomes
and periodontal tissue repair. Aim 3: To use a new strategy to target inflammasomes for
preventing murine periodontitis.

The mechanism by which metabolism, diet, and olfactory function is linked is not well understood. The rising
incidence of diabetes and obesity in our country is epidemic, yet little has been reported as to how chronic
metabolic imbalance impacts sensory systems and whether these dysfunctions can be reversed via changes
in diet, drug intervention, or selective genome editing. The work in this proposal will bridge gaps in our
knowledge concerning how changes in activity of the olfactory bulb (OB) can modify energy homeostasis.
To test how changes in OB excitability cause a reduction in body weight and energy metabolism, we will
manipulate contribution from a voltage-dependent potassium channel, Kv1.3, exclusively in the major
output neurons. Our long-term research goal is to understand how olfaction and metabolism are interrelated -
to reveal how olfactory output neurons convey metabolic information. Our proposed aims are based upon
the following three hypotheses: (1) Hypothesis 1 = Elimination of Kv1.3 channels in mitral/tufted cells will
increase action potential firing frequency and decrease the after-hyperpolarization amplitude, selectively
enhance glucose clearance, increase total energy expenditure, and decrease respiratory exchange ratio
(increase fat utilization), which will produce a drop in body weight or cause a resistance to diet-induced
obesity (DIO). (2) Hypothesis 2 = Odor stimulation will induce specific patterns of c-fos expression within
the hypothalamus and other brain regions in mice. DIO will attenuate c-fos activation in control mice with
normal Kv1.3 conduction, but not in similarly-fed, but DIO-resistant, mice in which Kv1.3 is selectively edited
from mitral/tufted cells. (3) Hypothesis 3 = Restoration of Kv1.3 activity selectively in mitral/tufted cells, but
not in the periphery, or decreased excitability will cause a loss in resistance to DIO as measured by body
weight, glucose tolerance, and system physiology parameters. Our experiments take a multidisciplinary
approach using electrophysiology, genome editing, and metabolic profiling to uncover the importance of
relayed olfaction information for energy homeostasis. The knowledge generated from our proposed research
defining the impact of olfactory bulb output on metabolic balance can be applied to lessen the health
consequences of the rising global problem of obesity and excess food consumption. It is a high priority that
we investigate coordination from extra-hypothalamic brain areas to determine their contribution to energy
balance – a novel and intellectually challenging view of the olfactory system."
10783088,"The granuloma is the hallmark pathological structure in tuberculosis (TB). This macrophage-rich complex immune structure can be host-protective but can also be co-opted by mycobacteria for growth and expansion. A critical pathogenic event in TB is granuloma necrosis, which increases bacterial growth, patient morbidity and transmission, thus sustaining the global burden of TB. Using the zebrafish larval model of TB, we have identified multiple genetically-driven host dysregulations that lead to accelerated necrosis of the early granuloma through different innate immune pathways. We identified bacterial virulence determinants that can co-opt these host vulnerabilities to accentuate necrosis. In this proposal, we will investigate three distinct pathways of early granuloma necrosis in the context of innate immunity. Medically induced TNF deficiency is a well-known TB risk factor, and we will investigate how it causes granuloma necrosis. We will investigate our hypothesis that TNF’s dominant effect is as a macrophage pro- survival factor, preventing mycobacterium-beneficial apoptosis. We will study how excess TNF, which we have shown to cause human TB susceptibility, is co-opted by mycobacteria to cause necrosis through a distinct pathway that involves TNF receptor 2. We will pursue our findings that mTOR facilitates a mitochondrial metabolic program that specifically protects against the mitochondrion-damaging effect of the mycobacterial virulence determinant, ESAT-6. We will understand how hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), a host resistance factor, becomes pathogenic when expressed constitutively in TB granulomas. Through the lens of mycobacterial pathogenesis, we hope to glean insights into immune signaling, immunometabolism and mitochondrial biology."
10834740,"Project Summary
Children who are born preterm are at a high risk for developing sensorimotor deficits. Though a majority of
children born preterm do not have a neuromuscular diagnosis such as cerebral palsy, many have mild to
moderate motor delays. These motor delays fall under the diagnosis of developmental coordination disorder or
developmental dyspraxia, a condition with difficulties in motor planning and coordination, that is theoretically
linked to somatosensory deficits. We hypothesize that deficit in somatosensory processing may precede this
diagnosis in preterm children, but these deficits are not identified due to a lack of reliable and valid assessment
methods for use with young children.
Somatic sensations refer to sensory information from the body, including touch and proprioception.
Proprioception -- the sense that lets us know how and where our body is moving -- is considered one of the
most important senses for controlling movements. Based on research on motor learning in adults, we know the
importance of accurate proprioception information on the control of movements. Difficulties in somatosensory
information will impact a developing nervous system’s ability to learn new motor skills. This effect theoretically
compounds as the child learns more motor skills with inaccurate somatosensory feedback, laying a poor
foundation for further learning. However, our current understanding of how the sensory and motor systems
interact in a developing nervous system is limited.
The poor understanding of somatosensory in development is in part due to the lack of accurate assessments
that measure somatosensory processing in young children. Current somatosensory assessments are limited to
clinical observations and parent reports on the child’s behavior, which lack objectivity and do not provide a
standard for comparison. Without objective assessments of somatosensory processing in young children,
somatosensory processing deficits are often not identified until later in their childhood, when they present with
motor delays.
We developed and pilot tested innovative methods to measure somatosensory processing in children as young
as 1 year old. The overall objectives of this project is to study somatosensory development in young children,
develop a method to identify children who have challenges with somatosensory processing, and to examine
the predictive relationship between somatosensory processing challenges in early childhood with later motor
development. We hypothesize that somatosensory develop play a major role in predicting motor skill
development and participation in activities of daily living in children who were born preterm.
This study is part of a larger research program that aims to better our understanding of somatosensory
development in children. We strive for early identification of children with somatosensory deficits, and to
develop targeted interventions for these deficits in children."

The purpose of this training grant is to prepare nurse scientists with the substantive and methodological
capacity to apply community-engaged intervention mapping (IM; integrating community-engaged research
approaches/CEnR with IM) as they design, test and implement multilevel theory-based interventions to prevent
and manage chronic illness in vulnerable populations. The T32 has matured over the last 25 years of funding;
the focus has expanded to address emergent scientific priorities in research on theory-based interventions for
preventing and managing chronic illness, and to reflect the strength and diversity of our faculty research. In this
application, we continue to address the scientific priorities of focusing on vulnerable populations and speeding
translation of interventions from research into clinical practice. We will enhance the ongoing T32 by providing
training in using community-engaged IM to design multilevel, theory-based interventions and effectively
engage stakeholders throughout the process. We posit that using community-engaged IM to design, test, and
implement theory-based multilevel interventions will speed translation into clinical practice. Our continued
focus on theory-based interventions will be enhanced by a new focus on multilevel interventions that use
behavior change and environment focused theories, and training in using IM and CEnR approaches to
effectively engage members of the target population, clinicians, communities, and other types of other
stakeholders in the research. For predoctoral trainees, enhancements to the PhD program will include: (a)
required courses structured to address IM core processes, traditional and contemporary CEnR approaches,
and 6 iterative steps; (b) mentored research experiences; and (c) participation in integrative and scientific
seminar series focused on developing competencies needed to build productive programs of research that
involve designing, testing and implementing multilevel theory-based interventions. For postdoctoral trainees,
the training program will include: (a) the required courses, (b) independent research experiences, and (c)
active involvement in both seminar series. Six pre-doctoral trainees and three post-doctoral trainees will be
supported each year over the 5 years of the training program. The emphases will capitalize on our faculty
strengths, strong research infrastructure, and well-established research partnerships on The University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill campus and throughout the rural and increasingly diverse state of North Carolina."
10868560,"Project Summary. The goal of this project is to define the interactions between RNA polymerase II, the basal
transcription factors, and the chromatin template that lead to accurate transcription initiation and productive
elongation. Using the many approaches available in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae model system,
fundamental aspects of gene expression will be studied. Specific Aim 1 will continue our studies of pre-
initiation complex (PIC) assembly using colocalization single-molecule TIRF microscopy. The interaction
dynamics of multiple basal transcription factors on the transcription template are imaged in real time using
nuclear extracts, which provide a more physiological context than purified systems. Our experiments to date
have already revealed unexpected transient intermediates and branched pathways not visible in ensemble
assays, necessitating revisions to current models for PIC assembly. These studies will be expanded to look at
additional factors, as well as to how promoter sequences and nucleosomes affect factor dynamics. Specific
Aim 2 will focus on how TATA-binding protein (TBP) and TBP-associated factors (TAFs), which together make
up the basal factor TFIID, interact to recognize promoters to nucleate PIC formation. Both single molecule
colocalization and FRET experiments will test recent models suggesting TFIID conformation changes occur
upon DNA binding. Specific Aim 3 will continue our studies of co-transcriptional histone modifications. Our
immobilized template in vitro transcription system has been extended to chromatinized templates, and we find
it can reproduce multiple histone modifications linked to transcription. The dynamics of the relevant modifying
enzymes will be tested by quantitative mass spectrometry and single molecule colocalization experiments to
determine if they remain associated with elongation complexes or get transferred to nucleosomes in passing.
The effect of pre-existing histone modifications will also be probed. For all three aims, interesting findings will
be validated in vivo using the genetic, genomic, and molecular techniques our lab has developed over many
years. Although this project uses a model system, mechanisms of transcription are highly conserved in
eukaryotes and, based on past experience, the results will almost certainly be directly applicable to human
gene expression. This fundamental knowledge is essential for understanding how mutations in transcription
factors and histone modifying enzymes lead to diseases such as cancer and developmental defects."

Recent years have witnessed a dramatic rise in interest towards cancer epitopes in general, and neoepitopes
that encompass mutations arising in a given tumor in particular. Current lines of research examine how the
epitope load in a given tumor relates to the success of checkpoint blockade treatments, and how to utilize
epitope-based vaccines and adoptive transfer of epitope-specific T cells for personalized therapies. For these
purposes, neoepitopes that are recurrently recognized in different individuals are of particular interest, which has
also re-ignited interest in epitopes identified in classic tumor-associated antigens. Along with the interest in
cancer epitopes, there is also interest in the TCRs and BCRs specifically recognizing them, as these have the
potential to be used in therapeutic approaches, and they can aid in basic studies to infer the specificity of T cells
or B cells characterized in single cell sequencing data. This resurgence of interest in epitopes has created a
need to catalog and make accessible to the scientific community all epitope data, also linked to the biological,
immunological, and clinical contexts. The ultimate goal is to come “full circle” and link epitope recognition and
immunological readouts to clinical outcomes and treatment strategies alike. In parallel, there is an urgent need
to develop resources for epitope prediction and analysis tools that provide access to predictive strategies and
provide objective evaluations of their performance in the relevant biological, immunological, and clinical contexts.
Recent years have also witnessed the publication of multiple original methodologies that reported sometimes
impressive gains in the predictions of cancer epitopes. However, several of these studies were difficult to
evaluate, because the methodologies and/or datasets were not fully available in a format that was readily
executable. As a result, their performance could not be properly benchmarked on independent datasets. This is
also because effective benchmarking on independent datasets requires the assembly of novel datasets of
sufficient size and diversity. To overcome all of these information technology challenges, we propose to design
and implement the Cancer Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (CEDAR), which will provide a freely
accessible, comprehensive collection of cancer epitope and receptor data curated from the literature, and provide
easily accessible epitope and TCR/BCR target prediction and analysis tools. As the cancer epitope data are
curated, they will be used as a transparent benchmark of how well prediction tools perform, and also to develop
new prediction tools for the analysis resource component of CEDAR. CEDAR will leverage our expertise from
developing the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB), which is fully operational and widely
used by researchers globally. CEDAR will directly complement other projects currently funded through the NIH
ITCR program that provide resources and tools related to cancer omics data. Finally, we will engage in outreach
activities to improve functions, user interfaces, and interoperability with other ITCR tools and promote the use of
CEDAR in cancer research."

Project Summary
This K23 proposal details a comprehensive 5-year training program that will support the candidate’s transition towards
becoming an independent investigator. The candidate (Dr. Tony V Pham), a first generation college student,
underrepresented in medicine psychiatrist, will focus his career on developing and rigorously testing mind-body
interventions with better access and relevance to underserved populations with chronic illnesses. In this application, the
candidate proposes to address the chronic pain-depression co-morbidity in the older Black community by culturally
adapting Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT). Among older Blacks, chronic pain co-occurs with depression,
and this co-morbidity worsens physical and emotional function; however, Blacks face multiple barriers to evidence-based
non-pharmacological pain and depression management including systemic racism, stigma, and the lack of culturally
tailored care. A culturally tailored MBCT may be an effective and efficient solution to improve physical and emotional
outcomes among this underserved population. This K23 will develop Quiet Focus, a cultural adaptation of MBCT for
older Blacks with chronic musculoskeletal pain and co-occurring depression. My preliminary conversations with the
community revealed strong interest in Quiet Focus, support for MBCT’s relevance to the community, and interest in
participation only if the intervention is abbreviated and is delivered by a lay instructor from the Black community. In Aim
1, I will develop Quiet Focus using guidance from the older Black community with chronic pain and co-occurring
depression. The starting point for Quiet Focus will be an abbreviated, evidence-based MBCT protocol (8 60-minute
sessions) developed by co-mentor Shallcross. I will train lay instructors under the mentorship of co-mentor Joo and
develop a fidelity protocol under the mentorship of primary mentor Vranceanu and co-mentor Shallcross. In Aim 2, I will
train a Black lay individual to deliver Quiet Focus and assess preliminary feasibility and fidelity. In Aim 3, I will train a
new Black lay individual to deliver Quiet Focus and another to deliver a time- and dose-matched control. I will then
conduct a feasibility RCT of Quiet Focus and control and assess definitive feasibility benchmarks including fidelity.
These proposed efforts will inform an efficacy trial through the R01 mechanism (primary outcome is physical function) as
well as future studies aimed at generalizing this work to other underrepresented groups. These study aims are supported
by 3 main training goals aimed at developing expertise in: (1) community engaged intervention development, (2) mixed
methods research for intervention refinement, and (3) community-engaged clinical trials. These training goals are
supported by (1) a team of expert mentors (Vranceanu, Jackson, Joo, and Shallcross), advisors (Mischoulon, Parker,
Okereke), and a community advisory board (Jacqueline Hinton, Michael Kincade), (2) a rich institutional environment,
and (3) targeted materials and meetings. For the past year, I have built the infrastructure for this proposal through formal
and informal meetings with Black community leaders and groups of older Blacks with chronic pain and co-occurring
depression. This K23 proposal is in line with NCCIH’s funding priorities to advance how Complementary and Integrative
Health can improve pain outcomes, address the whole person, and increase diversity within the research workforce."

CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has shown remarkable treatment effects in B-cell
malignancies, but many patients suffer from limited response and CD19-negative tumor relapse. Recently, we
demonstrated that next-generation “armored” CAR T cells constitutively expressing the immune-stimulatory
molecule CD40 ligand (CD40L) exhibited superior antitumor efficacy in preclinical studies but have not yet been
fully explored in the context of CAR antigen-negative tumor relapse.
There remains an urgent need for the non-invasive in vivo tracking of transfused T cells to determine their
biodistribution, expansion, and functionality and to increase the CAR T cells’ killing capacity in case of imminent
treatment failure. To overcome these limitations, we began developing methods for monitoring the in vivo kinetics
of CAR T cells based on the concept of immune cell radiohapten capture. We demonstrated for the first time that
T cells can be successfully transduced with a DOTA-antibody reporter, the DAbR1, enabling their in vivo tracking
via PET and SPECT. In the current proposal, we build on this work and optimize our approach for translation of
immune cell radiohapten capture from animals to patients, based on greatly improved components of 1)
radiohapten capture reporter scFv C825 with picomolar binding affinity, and 2) optimized radiohaptens, the next-
generation Proteus-DOTA (Pr) series suitable for imaging and targeted alpha therapy (TAT). The primary
objectives of this study are to develop a clinically applicable PET imaging strategy of CAR T cell trafficking in B-
cell malignancies and further study the effect of CD40L on counteracting the immune inhibition in syngeneic
models of B-cell malignancies. The secondary objectives are to deliver TAT to enhance T cells’ killing capacity
in cases of imminent treatment failure and improve the potency of CAR T cell therapies.
We project to achieve
our aims by generating second-generation and armored CD 19 CAR T cells expressing cell-surface anchored
scFv C825. Syngeneic and immunodeficient xenograft murine models of CD19+ B cell malignancies including
antigen-loss variants will be employed.
After successful transduction, we will assess in vitro functionality of the
CAR and the reporter, as well as radiation toxicity, followed by in vivo functionality, imaging sensitivity, and
biodistribution, and develop an armored CAR T cell-based theranostic approach with the novel pair
[86Y]YPr/[225Ac]AcPr. Finally, as a prerequisite to clinical translation of this novel platform, we will conduct studies
using human second-generation and armored CAR T cells in clinically relevant xenograft models. The availability
of such a single platform would provide crucial information for safer, more effective clinical trials. The aims thus
have immediate translational relevance for our current clinical CD19 CAR T studies and other planned CAR T
cell therapy trials."
10800764,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Down syndrome (DS) is the leading genetic cause of intellectual disability. Although delayed, cognitive
skills develop across childhood and into early adulthood in DS. In adulthood, the study of cognitive functioning
in DS shifts from a focus on improvement to a focus on cognitive loss. Because of the triplication of genes located
on chromosome 21, individuals with DS are at risk for an earlier onset and increased incidence of Alzheimer’s
Disease (AD). In the general population, the diagnosis of AD is preceded by long preclinical and prodromal
phases that extend over two decades, and language markers are early indicators of the progression of AD. In
individuals with DS, however, gaps in our understanding of development across the lifespan present significant
hurdles for research on the progression from normative (albeit delayed) development to the early phases of later
cognitive decline. Crucial goals of DS research include elucidating variations in the patterns of development and
decline, identifying factors that may be protective and foster resilience against cognitive decline, and developing
interventions to support cognitive resilience. Developing measurement tools that that can be used to characterize
both growth and decline and evaluating their psychometric properties is vital for understanding disease
progression, recognizing potential points of intervention, and evaluating the efficacy of new treatments. In this
project, we propose, using a dataset previously collected from 107 participants with DS (6 – 23 years of age), to
(1) evaluate the psychometric properties of 9 aging-sensitive spoken language metrics and (2) characterize the
developmental trajectories of these metrics relative to participant characteristics to help determine the skills
contributing to development and decline. These aims will be addressed by re-transcribing and coding language
produced in two expressive language sampling contexts that are the first to be validated for use in DS. Measures
derived from the samples will include those indexing lexical and semantic skills, syntactic skills, and verbal
hesitations. Test-retest reliability will be assessed over a four-week interval. Standardized measures will be used
as indicators of construct validity. A two-year longitudinal follow-up will yield an estimate of relative sensitivity to
change of the various measures. The developmental trajectories of these metrics will be explored by describing
the performance as a function of participant characteristics (i.e., chronological age, nonverbal and verbal
cognition, working memory, adaptive skills, and autism symptomatology). By validating and establishing the
psychometrics of these aging-sensitive spoken language metrics in children, adolescents, and young adults with
DS, the proposed study will provide tools that can facilitate our understanding of development in DS and identify
potential treatment targets to promote resilience against later decline, bridging the conceptual gap between
studies of development and studies of decline."
10847429,"Project Summary:
Although almost all colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality is due to metastasis, there are currently no drugs to prevent
or halt metastasis. A better understanding of the underlying biology of CRC progression and metastasis could
lead to the next generation of therapeutics aimed at blocking steps in the metastatic cascade. Previous research
provided a framework to understand tumor metastasis through sequential stages of cancer cell invasion into the
basement membrane, migration into vasculature, circulation, extravasation, and colonization of distant organs.
Each step is heavily dependent on diverse cell-cell communications and the microenvironment, which has not
been well recapitulated in previous in vitro and in vivo model systems to study CRC metastasis. However, the
recent development of CRISPR-engineered 3D colorectal cancer organoids (CRCOs) and colonoscopy-guided
orthotopic CRC transplantation models have provided a more physiological model system to study metastasis.
The CRCOs are precisely engineered with oncogenic mutations found in the majority of human CRC, such as
mutations in the Apc, Kras, and P53 genes (AKP). Moreover, these engineered CRCOs are transplanted into
the murine colon, where they grow in their native environment and metastasize to the liver: the most common
site of CRC metastasis in humans. Previous research using these model systems identified Twist1 as
significantly upregulated in CRC liver metastases compared to the primary tumor. Twist1 is a well-known
transcription factor involved in promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT is when epithelial cells
lose their cell adhesions and acquire a more motile mesenchymal phenotype. It is unclear what role Twist1 plays
in CRC progression and metastasis. Aim 1 will verify that Twist1 is upregulated in liver metastases compared to
the primary tumor from AKP CRCOs in orthotopically transplanted mice using immunohistochemistry,
RNAscope, and RT-qPCR. Aim 1 will also assess whether Twist1 is necessary for liver metastasis formation
through CRISPR-Cas9-mediated loss in AKP organoids and a diphtheria toxin receptor cell-elimination model.
Moreover, to evaluate if overexpression of Twist1 increases metastatic potential, the AKP CRCO will be
engineered to overexpress Twist1 using complementary DNA. Thus, Aim 1 will determine whether Twist1 is
required for CRC metastasis. The role of TWIST1 in human CRC progression and metastasis will be the focus
of Aim 2. Aim 2 will screen human CRC tissue microarrays for expression of TWIST1 and other EMT
markers. TWIST1 in each tissue will be quantified and correlated with patient tumor site, stage, genotype, and
outcome. Moreover, to validate TWIST1 is more highly expressed in human CRC metastases, a human CRCO
will be transplanted into immunodeficient mice and assayed for expression of TWIST1 by immunohistochemistry,
RNAscope, and RT-qPCR. Such knowledge of TWIST1’s role in CRC metastasis can illuminate targets for the
first metastasis-specific therapies and improve the field’s understanding of EMT and metastasis."

The long term objectives of this program are to 1) increase the number of engineers who understand that they
have a direct effect on the safety of workers who work with the equipment and work systems engineers design,
and 2) increase the number of engineers who choose to go into applied or research positions in the area of
occupational safety and health.
Traineeships in Occupational Safety and Ergonomics are available in the Department of Integrated Systems
Engineering (ISE) at The Ohio State University. These provide educational opportunities to engineering
students at the master's level who are interested in pursuing industrial, consulting, or academic careers in
occupational safety and ergonomics or related areas. Plans of study typically require 4-5 semesters to
complete. Students take courses in occupational biomechanics and ergonomics, cognitive systems
engineering, occupational health, occupational safety, human error and systems failure or resilience
engineering, and experimental design. Students are trained in responsible conduct of research practices and
have opportunities to get involved in cutting edge research that addresses a number of original NORA Priority
Research Areas, including Low Back Disorders, Musculoskeletal Disorders of the Upper Extremities, Traumatic
Injuries, Emerging Technologies, Organization of Work, Special Populations at Risk, Exposure Assessment
Methods, and/or Intervention Effectiveness Research. Research projects, seminars, internships, a safety
practicum, and other opportunities expose students to several sectors in the current NORA Sector-Based
Approach such as Healthcare, Manufacturing, Public Safety, Service workers, and Warehousing. Students
learn from OSU faculty, experienced OHS practitioners, and workers. While students learn about safety and
ergonomics fundamentals, they also learn about emerging trends and concepts, such as resilience as an
approach to safety & engineering and wellness approaches to occupational safety and health. Laboratory
facilities and equipment the students work with are state-of-the-art, including OSU's Spine Research Institute,
and the OSU Libraries system is second-to-none.
OSU's College of Engineering and the Department of Integrated Systems Engineering continue to refine and
improve strategies for recruiting and retaining top-notch graduate students from groups that are
underrepresented in engineering, and our training program has participated in these strategies when recruiting
participants for the program. Advisory Board members bring experience from labor, industry, research,
government, and education, and provide the program with important, relevant perspectives, as well as
providing direct support to students through internships, safety practicum sponsorships, guest lectures in
classes, and seminars. The training program provides Ohio, a state with more than 921,000 employers and
5.2 million workers, and the nation with engineers with training to identify and address occupational safety and
ergonomics hazards in a wide variety of work settings. Program graduates become valuable employees
because of the breadth of their training (including in research methods, occupational safety, occupational
health, and ergonomics/human factors/cognitive systems engineering), diverse sector exposure (service
sector, manufacturing, warehousing, healthcare, and others), and instructor exposure (academics and
experienced professionals), or students may opt to build upon that strong foundation of knowledge with further
education and training at the doctoral level."

occupational trends (e.g., downsizing, contingent labor and long work hours, telework) have propelled the need
for studies on OHP. OHP is concerned with the broad range of exposures and mechanisms that affect the
quality of working life and the responses of workers, such as how individual psychological attributes interact
with job content and work organization as well as organizational policies and practices. OHP research and
practice explores interventions targeting the work environment as well as the individual to create healthier

also to maximize their overall effectiveness and sense of wellbeing. As such, OHP fits many of the strategic
goals of the NIOSH Total Worker Health® initiative.
Trainees are recruited from UConn's I/O doctoral program, which is the only one of its kind in the New England
states, making it possible to recruit stellar students for this training. Trainees learn how to contribute to the
OHP knowledge base and become highly capable at discovering and/or implementing new ways of maintaining

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) afflicts 5.8 million in the USA, but there remains no disease-modifying therapy. Critical
for progression from pre-symptomatic to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia is the loss of synapses in
relevant brain regions. We seek to define the molecular basis of this synapse loss. In the previous cycle, we
demonstrated an essential role for aberrant metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) activation in synapse
dysfunction, synaptic loss and memory deficits using cellular assays, brain slices and transgenic mice. Our
Preliminary studies here demonstrate that synapse loss is mGluR5-dependent in gene knock-in as well as
transgenic models, and that it can be tracked by longitudinal PET imaging. We have discovered a sub-nanomolar
potent and orally available mGluR5 silent allosteric modulator (SAM, BMS-984923) that blocks this AD process,
while preserving physiological Glu signaling.
We now aim to address two key issues regarding this clinically targeted AD synapse loss pathway. Single cell
transcriptomic profiling will be utilized to understand how synaptic mGluR5 modulation interacts with diverse
molecular pathways and glial cells in AD. Single particle cryo-electron microscope studies will be employed to
understand the basis for differential mGluR5 regulation by Aßo/PrPC vs Glu, and for SAM action. Hypotheses
generated from the transcriptomic and protein studies will be tested in human iPSC-derived neurons and in
mouse gene knock-in models. To maximize relevance, signaling will be triggered by Aßo purified from human
AD brain."
10800766,"Abstract: Human gut infections by Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile (here, C.diff.) are the most lethal urgent
threat in the 2019 CDC Antibiotic Resistance Threats Report. Excess healthcare costs from these infections have
been estimated to be over $5 billion annually. Antibiotic resistance has elicited an insightful RFA RA18-725,
`Generating new insights and mechanistic understanding of antibiotic resistance'. C.diff. infections (CDI) typically
arise following treatment of other clinical disorders with antibiotics. Antibiotic therapy disrupts normal gut
microbiota, allowing C.diff. to proliferate and to repopulate the gut following treatment. Additional antibiotic therapy
to treat CDI prevents return of normal gut microbiota, leading to recurrent infections in over 20% of patients. C.diff.
has acquired resistance to several common antibiotics, compounding its therapy. Recent clinical guidelines (2018)
for C.diff. infections are oral vancomycin for patients in shock, hypotension, ileus or megacolon. Fecal transplant
is recommended for nonresponsive infections following vancomycin treatment. mAb therapies have been FDA-
approved, but are not recommended. Despite these therapies, C. difficile causes an estimated 224,000 infections
and 13,000 deaths per year (CDC in 2017). Gut epithelial cell cytotoxicity results from C.diff. production of
secreted toxins, primarily TcdA and TcdB (Tcds). Tcds are processed in gut cells to form active UDP-glucosyl
transferases that glucosylate cytoskeletal-regulating Rho, Rac and Cdc42 GTP-binding proteins on specific
threonines. Loss of cytoskeletal integrity causes severe colitis and can have a fatal outcome.
 Anti-toxin immunity is a historic approach to prevent host damage from circulating bacterial toxins. We
propose that small molecule, tight-binding inhibitors targeting C.diff. Tcds can prevent the morbidity and mortality
from gut toxins in C.diff. infections. Our transition state analog approach uses kinetic isotope effects and quantum
chemistry to solve transition state structures of Tcds. Solving the first transition state structures of G-protein
glucosyltransferases, and developing the first transition state analog of any UDP-sugar transferase is innovative.
Electrostatic potential models of Tcd transition states will guide the design and synthesis of transition state
analogs. Lead transition state analog candidates will be elaborated by cycles of crystallography and chemical
design. Candidate compounds and crystal structures of Tcd complexes have been obtained in preliminary studies.
Inhibitors will be characterized against Tcds in human cells and in mouse models.
 Agents to prevent tissue damage from C.diff. infections, without disruption of the gut microbiome or
pressure for microbial resistance have important medical relevance. Inhibition of Tcds in gut epithelial cells places
no selective pressure for antibiotic or anti-toxin resistance on C.diff. or on the gut microbiome, while protecting the
gut by neutralizing Tcds. Mechanistically, this approach is innovative in recapitulating vaccine-based antibody
neutralization of toxins using the powerful approach of transition state analogs."

 Stroke is the third leading cause of death among African Americans (AAs): they are twice as likely to die from
stroke as European Americans (EAs), and their incidence rate is almost double that of EAs. Recent genome-
wide studies (GWAS) suggest there is a substantial genetic contribution to stroke risk in African ancestry
populations, with heritability estimates of about 35%. However, to date, genetic studies in AAs are greatly lagging
behind those in EAs despite their increased stroke burden. Among the risk factors for stroke, blood pressure is
a major contributor: 4 in 10 AAs suffer from hypertension, 50% more than EAs. These disparities have been
considered to be mediated by environmental and social determinants, yet they remain after adjusting for
demographics, socioeconomic status, clinical characteristics, and modifiable health behaviors. Heritability
analysis suggests African ancestry is associated with hypertension, with heritability estimates from 30–40% for
systolic and diastolic blood pressure. However, genetic susceptibility to hypertension among AAs is less well
studied compared to other ethnic groups. Therefore, there is considerable motivation for identifying the genetic
components of stroke and high blood pressure in AAs.
 Discovery of genetic variants that predispose to blood pressure and stroke is a crucial step toward
understanding genetic mechanisms that may lead to novel prevention and treatment strategies. Yet, GWAS have
thus far identified genetic loci that together account for only a small proportion of the heritable risk. Substantial
efforts have been devoted to studying the association of genetic variation with gene expression and other
molecular characteristics through large collaborative initiatives such as Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and
Encyclopedia of DNA Elements. These initiatives have provided a deeper understanding of functional elements
across the genome, which have been used to inform genetic association and identified many novel loci. However,
most of the data in these studies have focused on European ancestry and little has been done in AAs. Our recent
work in Nature shows that genetic discoveries in one population do not readily transfer to other populations.
 The objective of this study is to identify variants predicting various genomic features (gene expression,
methylation and protein) in AA samples that have been recently collected through Trans-Omics for Precision
Medicine, the CommonMind Consortium, and GTEx, and to integrate this functional information into genetic
association analysis of blood pressure and stroke in AAs. Insight into both molecular activity and genetic variation
can inform association analysis and enable novel genome-wide discoveries. In particular, we propose to develop
methods that leverage the data for EAs to improve power for identifying genetic variants that regulate various
types of genomic features in AAs, and for integrating the genomic regulation models into GWAS with the ultimate
goal to identify novel loci for stroke risk and blood pressure in AAs. To facilitate these aims we have assembled
the largest number of AAs for genomic studies and AA stroke cases and blood pressure data for GWAS."

About one-third of people with epilepsy do not respond to currently available drug regimens, though many have
drug-resistant focal epilepsy amenable to surgical treatment. Among the most common epilepsy-associated
structural brain lesions are Focal Cortical Dysplasias (FCDs). FCDs are malformations of cortical development
where the affected neurons fail to migrate in the proper neocortex formation in utero. Somatic variants in about
10-20 genes have been reported as the underlying cause for a subset of FCDs1–13. However, we and others
have shown that 60-90% of patients with FCD type I (FCD I) and FCD type II (FCD II) lack any genetic
abnormality when using currently available testing methods. More strikingly, only a single gene has been
identified in FCD I12 to date. One reason could be that all previous genetic studies in FCD were observational
studies in candidate genes without rare variant burden testing against controls and have been performed in
small (n<77), poorly characterized, cohorts. None of these studies investigated copy number variants or
chromosomal alterations at the somatic level. Also, RNA dysregulation in FCD samples has not been explored
yet. Here, we propose the most comprehensive genetic analysis to date of a unique cohort of FCD I and II
patients with unprecedented deep clinical phenotyping. Our cohort is >13 times larger than any previously
published FCD I and II cohort. Combined with controls, this cohort enables the first rare variant burden analysis
for FCDs to confirm proposed and discover novel FCD-associated genes. In addition, we are the first to
generate single-nucleus RNA sequencing data from the brain tissue of FCD patients to study transcriptome-
level alterations associated with FCD I and II and genetic subtypes. Project hypothesis: Our comprehensive
and novel approach using well-characterized brain tissues and paired blood samples from patients with
epilepsy due to FCD I or FCD II will identify novel FCD causal genes and variants with clear diagnostic and
therapeutic implications. Impact: A better understanding of the genetic basis of FCD etiology will lead to the
introduction of novel gene-based diagnostic strategies and targeted drugs to fully manage a patient's seizures
while avoiding the spectrum of side effects typically associated with current therapeutic interventions. AIM 1:
Identify novel causal genes for FCD I and FCD II with germline and somatic brain variant burden. Aim 2:
Identify disease-associated somatic copy number variants (CNVs) and loss-of-heterozygosity (CN-LOH)
structural variants associated with FCD I and FCD II. Aim 3: Analyze resected brain tissues by single-nucleus
RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) to identify cell type-specific transcriptional alterations associated with FCD
histopathologies and with specific mutations."
10800791,"ABSTRACT
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disease characterized by high morbidity and
mortality, and largely ineffective treatments. SLE is genetically complex with strong familial aggregation and high
heritability. Most of the risk alleles for SLE are not protein-coding sequence changes, suggesting that a significant
portion of disease risk is mediated by regulatory variants in the noncoding genome. At a recently identified
intergenic SLE risk locus on chromosome 12q12, our in silico analyses implicate the risk variants as eQTLs that
impact transcription of genes in multiple biological pathways that contribute to SLE immunopathology, including
type I interferon (IFN) and anti-viral genes. This intergenic SLE risk locus is enriched in regulatory elements and
resides adjacent to several long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes. In this proposal, we outline a comprehensive
set of mechanistic and functional experiments to understand the role of the 12q12 risk locus in human immune
cells. We hypothesize that several variants within cis-regulatory elements at the 12q12 locus alter the expression
of adjacent lncRNAs, which in turn exert cis and trans effects on immune system genes resulting in increased
SLE risk. An alternate hypothesis is that the 12q12 locus could be a long-range enhancer for nearby protein-
coding and/or non-coding genes. These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, and our experimental design will
detect each possibility. In Aim 1, we will determine the overall impact of the intergenic 12q12 locus on gene
regulation in primary immune cells and selected cell lines. Integrative analyses will be used to infer lncRNA
influences on mRNA networks. Candidate lncRNAs from these analyses will be knocked down with siRNAs to
confirm their function. In Aim 2, we will identify causal cis-regulatory elements in the intergenic 12q12 region.
We will use complementary methods to identify likely regulatory elements, and putative causal elements will be
knocked out in cell lines to confirm function and reversion to a non-risk cellular phenotype. We expect to find that
the intergenic 12q12 locus influences the expression of adjacent lncRNAs and/or neighboring protein-coding or
non-coding genes in a cell type-specific manner, resulting in simultaneous modulation of multiple biological
pathways involved in SLE pathogenesis. This knowledge could suggest novel therapeutic targets for SLE that
would influence multiple pathogenic pathways. This represents a novel mechanism of disease in SLE and
provides an illustration of how intergenic risk variants can function in complex disease pathogenesis."

The protein-protein interaction between menin and Mixed Lineage Leukemia 1 (MLL1) protein plays a critical
role in acute leukemia with chromosomal translocations of the MLL1 gene, affecting both children and adults.
Leukemia patients with MLL1 translocations have very poor prognosis, with only ~35% five-year survival rate,
implying an urgent need for new therapies. The menin-MLL1 interaction also plays an important role in acute
myeloid leukemia (AML) with mutations in the nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) gene and with chromosomal
translocations of the Nucleoporin 98 (NUP98) gene, both are associated with very poor prognosis in patients.
The interaction of menin with MLL1 is required for the recruitment of MLL1 and MLL fusion proteins to the target
genes (e.g. HOXA and MEIS1 genes), which are critical to leukemogenesis in the MLL1-rearranged, NPM1-
mutated and NUP98-rearranged leukemias. Thus, the menin-MLL1 interaction plays a critical role in acute
leukemia with upregulated HOX genes, constituting ~50% of all acute leukemia cases, supporting that small
molecule inhibition of this interaction might provide new targeted therapy for leukemia patients. We pioneered
development of small molecule inhibitors of the menin-MLL1 interaction, which directly bind to menin at the MLL1
binding site and strongly inhibit this protein-protein interaction. Subsequent medicinal chemistry optimization
resulted in advanced menin-MLL1 inhibitors, such as MI-3454, with sub-nanomolar activity and high selectivity.
MI-3454 demonstrates very pronounced activity in the MLL1-rearranged and NPM1-mutated leukemia models,
blocking proliferation and inducing differentiation of leukemic cells through downregulation of HOX and MEIS1
genes, and strongly blocks leukemia progression in vivo in AML models, including complete remission. We have
also developed and substantially optimized a new class of menin-MLL1 inhibitors that belong to a novel scaffold
that fits very well to the MLL1 binding site on menin. These compounds have very pronounced activity in blocking
the menin-MLL1 interaction and demonstrate strong effect in leukemia models, representing very attractive
candidates to identify clinically relevant compounds with improved drug-like properties. In this project we propose
to develop the next generation of menin inhibitors with picomolar activity derived from our advanced lead
compounds for their clinical translation to AML patients. We will apply highly interdisciplinary approach, involving
medicinal chemistry, structure-based design, pharmacokinetic (PK) studies and biological studies to develop
highly optimized compounds with very strong in vivo efficacy in aggressive models of high HOXA leukemia, such
as patient derived xenograft (PDX) models of AML, and with optimized drug-like properties. We will also study
optimal combinations of our next generation of menin-MLL1 inhibitors with other agents to identify the best
combinations for future clinical studies. We expect this work should result in the next generation of menin-MLL1
inhibitors with superior activity and drug-like properties over existing menin inhibitors that will be very attractive
for clinical translation to leukemia patients"
10917180,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
An important longstanding goal in neuroscience research is to understand how large-scale spatiotemporal
patterns of neural activity emerge in the brain and whether they have a direct role in shaping the brain’s
computational processes and thereby mammalian behavior. Notably, traveling waves of neural activity have
been implicated in sensory, cognitive, and motor behaviors, and this team recently found that intrinsic traveling
waves (iTWs) in visual cortical areas predict the magnitude of evoked spiking activity and visual perceptual
sensitivity in awake, behaving non-human primates. However, it remains unclear whether iTWs reflect an
underlying fundamental mechanism of cortical function or whether they might simply be epiphenomenal.
This project will examine the role of neocortical iTWs in visual perception and is guided by a theoretical model
of iTW activity that makes specific testable and falsifiable predictions about the mechanisms that give rise to the
spatiotemporal features of iTWs and their roles in sensory behavior. The model is based on a network of spiking
neurons and predicts that iTWs emerge from the anatomical organization of horizontal cortical fibers and result
in shifts in the balance of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) population activity that travel as waves, The model
further predicts that iTWs are retinotopically coordinated across visual cortical areas, and that this coordination
is the mechanism by which iTWs improve perception. However, these predictions could be wrong. Empirical
tests of the model’s predictions will require activity measurements from specific neuron-types, across wide fields-
of-view, and with excellent spatial and temporal resolution in awake behaving animals.
To perform such measurements, the team recently invented several new technologies: (1) genetically encoded
fluorescent voltage indicators (GEVIs) that they will target to specific E or I neural populations; (2) a custom-built
dual-color fluorescence mesoscope to track the subthreshold population voltage dynamics of 2 neuron-types at
once, across a 8-mm field-of-view spanning multiple cortical areas in marmoset and mouse cortex; (3)
transparent electrode arrays that allow measurements of LFPs to be performed across the cortex concurrently
with voltage imaging studies of E and I population activity; (4) transparent laminar electrode arrays to measure
the spiking activity of cells across the different cortical layers. By combining the use of these four innovations in
marmosets and mice performing a visual detection task, the team will test the predictions of the theoretical model
and learn how different cortical neuron-types impact iTW dynamics and perceptual sensitivity.
Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that E/I population activity travels as iTWs in mice and marmosets. Aim 2 tests the
prediction that iTWs are coordinated retinotopically across cortical areas, and that this coordination enhances
perceptual sensitivity. Aim 3 will account mechanistically for the results of Aims 1 and 2 in a theoretically
grounded spiking network model. Overall, by using innovative new technologies this interdisciplinary team will
provide key insights into longstanding conceptual issues of profound importance to brain research."
10909098,"Project Summary
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been broadly successful in identifying genetic variants
associated to common disease risk, leading to successes in predicting disease risk in European populations
using polygenic risk scores. Unfortunately, there is a large gap in the accuracy of polygenic risk scores
between European and non-European populations, such that clinical efforts to improve biomedical outcomes
via precision medicine may exacerbate health disparities. The increasing availability of multi-ethnic data in
larger sample sizes provides opportunities to improve the accuracy of polygenic risk scores, by improving
localization of causal variants and aiding identification of variants with population-specific effects. Notably,
functional genomics data has great potential to improve all of these efforts, but has yet to be adequately
integrated into multi-ethnic approaches. Here, we propose to reap the advantages of integrative analyses of
multi-ethnic and functional data, building on the extensive progress of our research program on disease
mapping in multi-ethnic populations over the past 8 years; the focus of our current application is on adapting
existing statistical methods to a new setting, integrating multi-ethnic and functional data, which currently suffers
a large gap in available methods. Our research will be driven by empirical data from >2,500,000 multi-ethnic
samples (>1,500,000 with genotype/phenotype data and >1,000,000 with summary association statistics),
including African American, Latino, East Asian and South Asian samples spanning a wide range of diseases
and quantitative phenotypes. We will analyze both individual-level data and summary-level data and
incorporate functional data sets, including genome-wide functional annotations and gene expression data."

some a chronic disease with associated co-morbidities. Likewise, our historic research successes in deciphering
the mechanisms of fundamental HIV pathogenesis must now be directed to new questions about HIV elimination,
vaccines and therapeutic development, and efforts to treat and prevent subsequent disorders among people
surviving the disease. Researchers focused on these questions, with specific skillsets and knowledge, attractive
to multiple career paths, are needed to address these emerging challenges in HIV/AIDS disease. The overall
goal of this T32 is to prepare doctoral students with the knowledge, methodologic, analytic and leadership skills
to become successful future HIV research investigators. To achieve these goals, we will (A) Provide intensive
didactic education in HIV/AIDS research. A new required course in HIV Persistence will be offered to complement
a core didactic research curriculum. Research in progress will be shared among trainees and experts at an
annual retreat, and a catalog of elective courses will round out opportunities to build HIV knowledge in three
major emphasis areas: (i) cure research, including T-cell therapy and the reversal of viral latency; (ii) co-
morbidities, including malignancies and CNS disease; and (iii) prevention research, including vaccines and novel
therapeutics; (B) Recruit two outstanding doctoral students per year for 2 years of support with activities to
accelerate their progression to independence. Each trainee will have an individualized project characterized by
a) multiple-mentor teams to aid in the design and implementation of hypothesis-driven research projects, b) a
curriculum to build HIV specific knowledge and research skill sets, c) professional development including
presentation skills and grant-writing d) strong exposure including participation in group-based externship
opportunities in multiple career paths for HIV scientists, and strong programmatic oversight; and (C) Cultivate a
local infrastructure and multi-departmental culture of collaboration to support HIV research training. This
application joins faculty from multiple GW departments and schools, as well as the District of Columbia Center
for AIDS Research (DC CFAR) to introduce new perspectives and fresh ideas that will collectively offer
outstanding collaborative training in cross-cutting high priority areas of HIV research. Enhanced cross-school
and regional investigator orientation and networks, and research progress reports and meetings are intrinsic to
this plan. New approaches to enhance mentor development will be expanded and institutionalized to strengthen
faculty mentoring practices in effective autonomy-supportive mentoring."
10873882,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Dengue is the most prevalent vector-borne virus plaguing our world. In 2010, there were an estimated 390
million infections worldwide, 25% of which were symptomatic. The pathogenesis of dengue is complex
because of the existence of four serotypes. Infection with one serotype protects the individual against future
infections of the same serotype, but subsequent infection with a different serotype increases the risk of
symptomatic disease, which includes potentially life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock
syndrome. In endemic countries, children are most at risk of infection and disease. An immunizing vaccine is
crucial for population protection but large trials of live-attenuated vaccine in children show that younger age is
associated with future infection and severe disease independent of other variables. Vaccination is a correlate
to natural infection, where in previously unexposed individuals, antibodies that cross-react to many serotypes
protect against multiple dengue serotypes but are short-lived. Long-lasting protection most likely comes from a
small fraction of durable antibodies that are specific to one dengue serotype. What determines the production
of these type-specific antibodies and the viral epitopes that they target is not well understood. Immunologic
studies incorporating longitudinal observational data are needed to understand protective antibody
responses after primary natural dengue infection in children.
This study will address relationships between age, antibody quality, and dengue infection or disease. The
proposed research will utilize previously collected data and sera from an ongoing longitudinal observational
study, the Pediatric Dengue Cohort Study in Managua, Nicaragua. Using state-of-the-art recombinant viral
techniques and epidemiologic methods in this one-of-a-kind dataset, the proposal aims to 1) compare how
epitopes targeted by antibodies vary in younger and older children with known dengue serotype 2
infection and 2) assess the risk of dengue reinfection in younger and older children with prior natural
dengue infection. The results will establish the variation in antibody specificity and avidity in younger and
older children and inform future policy decisions regarding vaccination against dengue virus in this population
and possibly other Latin American countries.
Through the completion of these research aims the trainee will gain a unique set of skills in advanced
epidemiologic methods, virology, and immunology research, including analysis and interpretation of complex
immunologic and longitudinal data. Expert mentors in virology, immunology, and epidemiology will support the
trainee’s successful completion of the proposed research, associated training plan, and MD/PhD degree at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. This F30 fellowship will critically aid the applicant’s development as
a future interdisciplinary physician-scientist practicing at the intersection of virology, immunology, and
infectious disease epidemiology."
10879086,"Project Summary/Abstract
Neurodevelopmental processes are shaped by dynamic interactions between genes and environments.
Maladaptive experiences early in life can alter developmental trajectories, leading to harmful and enduring
developmental sequelae. Pre- and postnatal hazards include maternal substance exposure, toxicant exposures
in pregnancy and early life, maternal health conditions, parental psychopathology, maltreatment, structural
racism, and excessive stress. To elucidate how various environmental hazards impact child development, it is
imperative that a normative template of developmental trajectories over the first 10 years of life be established
based on a sufficiently large and demographically diverse sample of the US population. To accomplish this, the
Healthy Brain and Child Development National Consortium (HBCD-NC) has been formed to deploy a
harmonized, optimized, and innovative set of neuroimaging (MRI, EEG) measures complemented by an
extensive battery of behavioral, physiological, and psychological tools, and biospecimens to understand
neurodevelopmental trajectories in a sample of 7,500 mothers and infants enrolled at 24 sites across the United

assess how biological and environmental exposures affect those trajectories. A special emphasis will be placed
on understanding the impact of pre- and postnatal exposure to opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco and/or other

ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse cohort that is representative of the US population; 2) pregnant women
with use of targeted substances (opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco); and 3) demographically and behaviorally
similar women without substance use in pregnancy to enable valid causal inferences. In addition, the HBCD-NC
will identify key developmental windows during which both harmful and protective environments have the most
influence on later neurodevelopmental outcomes. The large, multi-modal, longitudinal, and generalizable dataset

Brain development occurs at a rapid pace prenatally and throughout childhood, impacted by dynamic genetic
and environmental influences. Studies using advanced neuroimaging have provided significant insights into
brain development but have been limited by small sample size, especially for high-risk populations. Substance-
exposed infants are at particularly high risk for adverse outcomes; however, findings are inconsistent, making it
difficult to disentangle prenatal exposure effects from other adverse influences. The objectives of our HEALthy
Brain and Child Development (HBCD) Prenatal Experiences and Longitudinal Development (PRELUDE)
consortium are to characterize typical trajectories of brain development from birth through childhood,
measuring the influence of key biologic and environmental factors and their interactions on child social,
cognitive, and emotional development. We will assess how children prenatally exposed to opioids and other
substances, as well as environmental adversity, differ in those brain trajectories and outcomes. Our consortium
consists of six centers (Arkansas Children’s Research Institute, Case Western Reserve University, Cincinnati
Children’s Hospital, Children’s National Medical Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and
Vanderbilt University) which have collaborated previously and have complementary expertise in neuroimaging,
neurophysiology, longitudinal clinical research, child development, substance exposure and addiction,
ethical/legal issues, and clinical care of high-risk infants/children. The PRELUDE consortium will recruit 680
pregnant women with substance use, 680 at-risk pregnant women without substance use, and 1360
comparison pregnant women representative of the general population to contribute to the overall HBCD study.
We will work closely with the other sites, the HBCD Consortium Administrative Core, and the HBCD Data
Coordinating Center to develop a comprehensive study protocol and ensure compliance of study workflow and
data transfer. Our consortium has an optimized research protocol and 4 specific aims: 1) Employ ethical and
evidence-based best practices to enroll and retain a diverse cohort of pregnant women into a longitudinal
study of infant/child brain development, oversampling mothers from high-risk backgrounds and those using
substances during pregnancy; 2) Engage a comprehensive array of maternal- and child-oriented community
stakeholders to identify community concerns and priorities regarding this research, minimize risks, and
promote long-term engagement of the recruited child-mother dyads; 3) Collect rich data to examine how
maternal health context and broader environmental factors may affect the maternal-fetal dyad and
neurodevelopment of children; 4) Capture key developmental windows during which maternal and
environmental factors may interact with brain and behavioral development of children. The insights from
these data will provide greater understanding of factors affecting early childhood brain development,
allowing targeted interventions and improved outcomes for mother-child dyads."

Autopsy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of diseases that cause dementia. It provides knowledge
essential for developing biomarkers, understanding cellular pathology responsible for the dementia, and
retrospectively identifying features most reliable for early diagnosis. Without this information rational discovery

pursue the dual goals of fulfilling national priorities set by NIA and NAPA while also fostering the
‘Heterogeneity in Aging and Dementia’ theme of the Northwestern ADRC. These goals will be achieved
through the following interactive aims:
 1) Provide state-of-the-art postmortem diagnosis on Clinical Core participants and make the results
 available in a timely fashion to family, clinicians, qualified researchers, and NACC.
 2) Collect, curate, and distribute biospecimens to qualified research projects, both within Northwestern
 University and for multi-center collaborations including NCRAD and ADGC.
 3) Support the specialized research interests within Northwestern University on unusually successful
 cognitive aging (SuperAgers), non-amnestic dementias such as primary progressive aphasia (PPA),
 frontotemporal lobar degenerations (FTLD), neuroinflammation, and mid-life onset AD (MOAD).
 4) Support local research on clinicopathologic correlation through a banking protocol that emphasizes
 bilateral tissue sampling for detection of hemispheric asymmetry and through stereology and densitometry
 for quantitative comparisons of cellular pathology with in vivo clinical and imaging data.
 5) Train the next generation of neuropathologists in a multidisciplinary setting that includes close interaction
 with clinicians, imagers and neuroanatomists and in a manner that serves the goals of the Research
 Education Component.
Integrating the cellular basis of the disease with its clinical manisfestations requires close interaction among
neuropathologist, neuroanatomist, imager and clinician to link the nature and distribution of the neuropathology
to the clinical phenotype and its trajectory. To this end, monthly CPC meetings provide an interactive setting for
superb training of fellows in rigorous diagnosis, clinicopathologic correlation and potential collaborative
research. The ADRC Brain Bank and Neuropathology and Imaging Biomarker Core laboratories, as well as
Core Leader and Director offices and other resources, are located in contiguous space on the same floor. This
infrastructure offers a dynamic incubator for multidisciplinary interactions between the Neuropathology Core
and other components of the ADRC."
10873202,"PROJECT SUMMARY - OUTREACH AND RECRUITMENT CORE
The Outreach, Recruitment and Engagement (ORE) Core will contribute to the goals of the Northwestern
ADRC with a focus on the theme of Heterogeneity in Aging and Dementia. The ORE Core will achieve its aims
by leveraging the independently funded components of the Mesulam Center: the Neurobehavior Clinic, Clinical
Trials and Observational Consortia, and Miller Family Life Enrichment & Non-Pharmacologic Intervention
Programs. The ORE Core will focus outreach, community engagement and recruitment on Mesulam Center
research priorities, i.e., primary progressive aphasia (PPA), behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia
(bvFTD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), healthy adults without cognitive impairment (“normal controls” and
SuperAging), and Mid-life Onset Alzheimer’s Disease (MOAD), with a focus on recruiting underrepresented
groups. The ORE Core will promote NIA and NAPA mandates specifically through the following goals:
 1) Optimize recruitment of participants according to ADRC research priorities into the Clinical Core and
 academic research studies through the Neurobehavior Clinic and targeted community engagement.
 2) Provide outreach and community engagement strategies for the recruitment and retention of
 underrepresented groups to the Northwestern ADRC according to center research priorities.
 3) Support the engagement of research participants and their families, particularly those who live at a
 distance, through novel and adaptable life enrichment programs and tailored non-pharmacological
 interventions, maintaining our center’s long-term commitment to our approach of “therapeutic encounters.”
 4) Initiate and coordinate public education programs in conjunction with city, state and national entities.
The ORE Core will pursue these goals through the provision of disease education, counseling and support for
the psychosocial needs of ADRC patients and caregiving families, the design and evaluation of innovative
programs that support both patients’ and caregiving families’ strength and resilience, and the engagement of
collaborative local community partnerships for the purposes of research recruitment and retention. We will
continue our work through outreach and engagement of underrepresented groups, the Clinical Core and other
center research teams, retention via non-pharmacological interventions and incorporation of a psychosocial
pathway, direct ‘phone call only’ follow-up for later stage participants for retention and commitment to brain
donation, and maintaining a leadership role in local and national collaborations and educational programs that
focus on the heterogeneity of disease, symptoms and needs for patient support and caregiver education and
resources."
10873206,"PROJECT SUMMARY - IMAGING BIOMARKER CORE
The Northwestern ADRC Imaging Biomarker Core has the long-term goal to characterize all eligible Clinical
Core participants with state-of-the-art structural, functional, and molecular imaging and curate these data for
use in future projects. The Northwestern ADRC Clinical Core currently maintains a cohort of over 500
participants. Approximately half of the Clinical Core Participants receive systematic MR imaging funded by
R01s from NIA, NINDS, and NIDCD. During the last cycle, the Imaging Biomarker Core increased imaging
coverage from approximately 50% of the Clinical Core cohort to nearly 70%. For the next cycle, it will acquire
and process structural, functional, and molecular imaging on additional Clinical Core participants who are not
covered by other research grants and who are targeted for relevant collaborative studies. We will use
advanced acquisition and analysis methods and ensure these data are integrated with other variables within an
infrastructure that supports intramural and extramural collaborations and provides rich opportunities for
training. The Imaging Biomarker Core is highly interconnected with the other Northwestern ADRC Cores in a
manner that enhances the missions of NAPA and the NIA. It will be guided by the following goals:
 1) Acquire systematic and multimodal neuroimaging (MR, PET) on Clinical Core participants who lack these
 biomarkers and who are eligible/recruited for collaborative studies we support. To this end, Clinical Core
 participants including cognitively healthy controls, individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment
 (aMCI), and individuals with AD/ADRD will be scanned with advanced PET and MR imaging modalities.
 2) Curate and share integrated imaging datasets on Clinical Core participants, which will serve intramural
 and extramural collaborations including REC trainee projects. This aim will draw upon a mature institutional
 computing structure to run pipelines for quality assurance, processing, and analysis of imaging data. The
 resulting imaging outputs will be incorporated with clinical and post-mortem data in our unified ADRC
 NeuroFiles database developed in collaboration with the Data Management and Statistics Core.
The infrastructure of the Imaging Biomarker Core includes two research-dedicated 3T Siemens MR magnets at
Northwestern’s Center for Translational Imaging (CTI) and a PET/CT scanner at Northwestern Memorial
Hospital. Data are directly routed from the scan console to the Northwestern University Neuroimaging Data
Archive (NUNDA), where quality assurance and analysis tools are launched with the support of a high-
performance computing cluster called QUEST. Collectively, these data will enhance the clinical and diagnostic
characterization of each Clinical Core participant and will be made available to approved intramural and
national collaborators including NACC. All phases of this proposal will offer unique opportunities for the training
of junior investigators in areas related to imaging and translational research."
10873213,"PROJECT SUMMARY - RESEARCH EDUCATION COMPONENT
The Northwestern ADRC, and the Mesulam Center within which it operates, have a solid tradition of mentoring
and training doctoral candidates, post-doctoral fellows and junior faculty in an interactive multidisciplinary
setting that provides research training through immersive activities and breadth of knowledge and skills
through a significant array of didactic educational modalities related to aging and AD/ADRD. During the past
cycle, the Research Education Component (REC) of the Northwestern ADRC has accrued much experience
and provided research education in aging and AD/ADRD to a large number of trainees. In the next cycle, the
overall goal of the Northwestern ADRC REC will be to optimize the training of a workforce to meet the nation’s
biomedical, behavioral and clinical needs in aging and AD/ADRD. The REC will have a broad mandate that will
interact with the activities of all other ADRC components and will be guided by the following goals:
 1) Provide cross-disciplinary research education for three research associates and junior faculty per year
 (REC Scholars) through innovative multidisciplinary mechanisms designed to bridge the gap between
 clinical and basic research experience in aging and AD/ADRD, with a stipend to provide time for training.
 2) Provide research education training for at least two REC Affiliates per year, similar to the training
 provided to REC Scholars, but without a stipend.
 3) Provide immersive research experiences and didactic training for at least five students per year at various
 levels of education, with concentration on underrepresented minorities, as a means of enhancing the
 pipeline for the future workforce in AD/ADRD.
In keeping with the overall theme of our ADRC, the REC program will emphasize the heterogeneity of brain
aging and dementia so that basic scientists are exposed to the complexity of the clinical presentations and
translate clinical findings into mechanistic studies, while clinicians appreciate the heterogeneity of the
underlying biological phenomena and translate basic findings into clinical research. The REC will be leveraged
by the extensive infrastructure of the Northwestern Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (NUCATS),
with an extensive array of programs, including courses in Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR), and the
Northwestern University Graduate School, including the Northwestern University Interdepartmental
Neuroscience Program (NUIN), and the McGaw Medical Center of Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine,
for diversity recruitment. REC will also organize the curriculum for didactic training modalities and will review
the background and career aspirations of trainees in order to ensure that clinicians become exposed to basic
research and basic researchers become exposed to clinical realities."

Drug addiction is a debilitating disorder that represents a significant public health burden. It is
widely believed that addiction hijacks normal processes within the brain that assign reward
values to past and future actions. These processes are not understood, which has hindered our
ability to identify effective therapeutic targets. Part of the brain known as the ventral striatum
(VS) has been shown to encode reward values, but it is not known how these value
representations are linked to specific past or future actions, or how the functional
implementations of reward evaluation and prediction are subdivided among different neuronal
cell types within the VS. In this proposal, we address these questions by studying interactions
between the VS and the hippocampus (HPC), one of its major inputs. In specific aim 1, we will
test the hypothesis that coordinated activity between the HPC and the VS that occurs after
reward collection is involved in linking the reward value to the previous action and updating the
brain’s estimate of how valuable that reward was. In specific aim 2, we will test the hypothesis
that HPC-VS interactions before reward collection are involved in choosing among several
possible actions based on which has the highest predicted reward value. In specific aim 3, we
will test the hypothesis that the neuronal populations in VS that interact with HPC before or after
reward collection are genetically distinct neuronal subtypes. We expect this project will
contribute broadly to our knowledge of how the brain evaluates past rewards and predicts future
rewards, which may identify new therapeutic targets for treating drug addiction."

The cornea and sclera are the principal load bearing members in the tough fibrous ocular tunic which we consider
to be an integrated mechano-biological structure. During development, the shape of the eye has been tuned to
conform to a specific mechanical environment through a long time-scale integration of its loading history with
its initial genetic patterning. Although mechanics are known to contribute to the development of many
connective tissues, the ocular globe is particularly sensitive to pressure (tensile wall stress) during the expansive
phase of growth. Even in the mature ocular tunic, mechanical instabilities often manifest as conditions which
disrupt vision (e.g. myopia, keratoconus, post-LASIK ectasia, tractional retinal detachments and glaucoma).
While the underlying causes of tissue structural instabilities are poorly understood, we suspect that they are
mechanobiological in nature and potentially reflect an imbalance in the tensional homeostasis that exists
between mesenchymal cells, their local ECM and the global mechanical environment. We know that during
development, disruption of the mechanical connection between fibroblastic cells and their ECM severely retards
ocular growth in a manner analogous to pressure loss, suggesting that mechanical communication is critical to
proper ocular morphogenesis. However, the effect of mechanical forces on the mechanisms which drive tissue
formation and growth are not well characterized. It is remarkable that we still do not fully understand how the
most important structural molecule in vertebrates, collagen, is efficiently assembled into highly-organized,
functional, load-bearing tissues which are massively expanded into macroscale structures during growth.
However, if we are able to uncover new mechanisms which control tissue formation and growth, we will have
access to information which can inform therapies for a variety of pathological conditions including fibrosis,
myopia, keratoconus and potentially, glaucoma. Additionally, if we understand how tissue is produced, then
there will be implications for engineering corneas de novo and for improving approaches to regenerative corneal
medicine. In the proposed work, we plan combine our human cell culture model of corneal stromal tissue
elaboration with live-cell mechanodynamics imaging to directly observe single collagen molecules during their
transition from solution to fibrils. We will thus directly test a new hypothesis which directly couples local and
globally applied forces directly to molecular assembly of collagen during fibrillogenesis and growth. The working
hypothesis for this proposal is that force causes corneal stromal ECM elaboration to regulate fibril assembly,
remodeling and growth. If the hypothesis is correct, there are myriad mechanotherapeutic opportunities and
more critically, our basic understanding of collagenous tissue formation and growth, will be fundamentally
altered."

Pacemaking sinoatrial node (SAN) that orchestrates the heart rhythm can become dysfunctional with aging.
Biopacemakers composed of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived pacemaking cardiomyocytes
(P-CMs) can be one therapeutic strategy that can restore the sinus rhythm in patients suffering from SAN
dysfunction. The development of biopacemakers is hampered by issues such as low differentiation yield of P-
CMs from hiPSCs and the long-term maintenance of the pacemaking function in engineered pacemaking tissues.
The function and phenotype of P-CMs can be affected by mechanical forces imposed by the extracellular matrix
(ECM) forming the cellular microenvironment and the cyclic strain due to cardiac contractions. The ECM has
been well demonstrated for shaping the phenotype of the working CMs. Hence, an optimal ECM should also
promote and sustain pacemaking function in P-CMs. We have data demonstrating that ECM of the SAN can
better sustain the pacemaking phenotype in hiPSC-derived CMs even when subjected to cyclic strain compared
to the left ventricular counterpart but the exact mechanisms that induce and maintain the pacemaking phenotype
are unclear. The goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms of mechanotransduction in P-CMs that
can be modulated by the ECM. We hypothesize that the SAN ECM may modulate the mechanotransduction in
resident P-CMs via cell-ECM junctions at the costameres and the cell-cell junctions at the fascia adherens to
maintain the pacemaking phenotype. To test the mechanistic underpinnings of our hypothesis, we propose the
following three aims: 1) to determine the cell-ECM-mediated mechanotransduction signaling in P-CMs, 2) to
determine the cell-cell-mediated mechanotransduction signaling in the P-CMs, and 3) to determine the integrated
cell-ECM and cell-cell junction network in mechanotransduction signaling in the P-CMs. A better understanding
of the mechanotransduction mechanisms in P-CMs can yield a source of human P-CMs from hiPSCs with long-
term pacemaking function, a set of microenvironmental criteria necessary for engineering sustainable
biopacemakers and inspire future new therapeutic or preventive strategies for SAN dysfunction."

The long-term goal of the proposed research is a paradigm shift towards limb size management rather than
socket size management in prosthesis users experiencing socket fit changes during the day. The focus of this
application is to implement and optimize a novel limb-volume management strategy, and then characterize its
impact on prosthesis user clinical outcomes, health, and quality-of-life.
The specific aims of the proposed research are to monitor user activity and socket fit within prostheses equipped
with novel socket release/relock mechanisms. Socket release is the relief of limb-socket pressures during sitting,
and relock is the return to the normal socket configuration. Different release/relock operations conducted while
sitting and their influence on subsequent ambulatory limb mechanics, socket fit, and functional outcomes are
tested. The procedure most beneficial to patient outcomes is implemented in long-term testing. Participants wear
prostheses with the socket release/relock mechanism in their free-living environments for four weeks. Outcome
measures are compared with results from traditional sockets.
To accomplish the aims, unobtrusive sensors that monitor prosthesis use and limb-socket distances indicative
of socket fit are integrated into prostheses with motor-driven socket release/relock mechanisms. A repeated-
measures study is conducted using a standardized protocol to determine if the ordering of pin relock and socket
relock after socket release affects subsequent limb fluid volume retention, limb vertical and angular positions in
the socket, user comfort, and functional performance. A crossover study is conducted to determine if use of
release/relock sockets compared with traditional sockets for 4 weeks enhances participant activity, socket fit,
self-reported outcomes, energy level, and residual limb health.
The relevance of the proposed application to public health is better understanding how use of active
release/relock affects users’ experience with a prosthesis, clinically-important outcomes related to residual limb
health, and users’ performance in life activities. Currently, it is unknown to what degree active release/relock
benefits prosthesis users’ quality of life. Potentially, the efforts described here can be extended to other areas
where devices require a secure and intimate fit with human tissues despite changes in soft tissue volume,
including trans-fermoral prosthetics, upper-limb prosthetics, and orthotics."

Modern engineers need to blend technical competence with global and competitive competence.
For biomedical engineers, efforts to support these core competencies is to cultivate the ability to
translate and commercialize design and innovation to impact the end-users. To meet this goal,
we propose to establish a distributed and interdisciplinary pipeline for sustainable student-driven
innovation. This proposal encompasses a comprehensive curriculum across disciplines to drive
longitudinal project development and innovation. Our first specific aim is to enhance senior
design project preparedness and student competency. This aim is met by thoroughly validating
needs with a redesigned interdisciplinary clinical immersion program and by developing a new
undergraduate biomedical engineering course to enhance student physical prototyping skills.
Needs fully validated by biomedical engineering and Innovation Medicine program medical
students with primary clinical experience ensures project development is aligned with the ability
to commercialize a product, and enhanced student prototyping skills support realistic
development with enhanced fidelity. Together these initiatives enable our second specific aim,
which is to leverage interdisciplinary collaboration to enhance medtech device design. This aim
is met by revising the undergraduate biomedical engineering senior design capstone to
incorporate the same medical students from clinical immersion. Moreover, the senior design
class will accept projects based on validated needs from clinical immersion, which enables
accelerated pacing and inclusion of both verification and validation in class. Product
development from senior design is then transitioned for further development to the same medical
students with their own capstone experience. Continuing projects from clinical immersion to
senior design and then to medical capstone has substantial benefit including the ability to retain
technical development and pursuit of further development that was not otherwise possible (e.g.,
publication of development, execution of limited studies, pursuit of intellectual property) by one
capstone experience alone. Effects of clinical immersion to validate needs and the prototyping
class to enhance prototyping competency will be evaluated using surveys and deliverables.
Effects of project origin (i.e., clinical immersion or other) and participation in the prototyping
class will be evaluated on the ability of teams to effectively collaborate within and outside
disciplines, design, verify performance requirements, and validate that design output meets
original need. Long-term success of leveraging interdisciplinary collaboration for medtech
device design will be evaluated by comparative assessment of medical capstone deliverables
based on project origin and participation of the pipeline. This proposed pipeline has the potential
to enable significant student-driven innovation.

10784742,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over the last decade, there has been an exponential increase in identified genetic causes of neurodevelopmental
disorders and epilepsy. With more than 100 genes identified, understanding how phenotypes relate to specific
genetic variants is critical, given the clinical complexity of developmental brain disorders. Given that treatment
and prognosis is dependent on understanding genotype-phenotype correlations, there is a critical need to better
assess clinical features in genetic epilepsies. However, phenotyping is a time-consuming, manual task with
limited throughput. To overcome this bottleneck, we have developed a novel approach, based on the Human
Phenotype Ontology (HPO), which we have previously applied to SCN2A-related disorders and to STXBP1-
related disorders, resulting in knowledge that is already applied clinically. Our long-term goal is to decipher the
phenotypic landscape of genetic epilepsies to improve clinical care.Therefore, our objectives are to determine
the relationship between genomic variation and epilepsy-related clinical features in a large patient cohort and to
identify subgroups within the 20 most common genetic epilepsies that may provide insight into outcomes and
treatment responses. We plan to pursue these objectives through two aims. First, we aim to determine the impact
of genomic features on epilepsy phenotypes in >9,000 individuals through an HPO-based approach (Aim #1).
We will analyze exome data in >13K individuals with trio exome data and >600K HPO terms to assess the
relationship between distinct monogenic etiologies and rare variants with clinical epilepsy features, using
computational phenotyping tools developed by our team. This will allow for insight into the relationship between
genetic etiologies and phenotypic features at a granular scale. Secondly, we aim to define relevant subgroups
in genetic epilepsies through phenotype harmonization (Aim #2). We will translate clinical features for the 20
most common genetic epilepsies to HPO terms and perform a semantic similarity analysis to determine whether
specific variants have significantly similar clinical features, followed by in-depth chart review. This knowledge will
inform the prioritization of variants for functional studies and clinical care. In summary, HPO-based delineation
of genetic epilepsies is expected to significantly improve knowledge of genotype-phenotype correlations by
adding unmatched detail and power. Our team has previously pioneered computational phenotype analysis in
the epilepsies and neurodevelopmental disorders, positioning us uniquely to address these questions. In addition
to facilitating research of disease mechanisms by prioritizing variants for work with stem cells or mouse models,
for example, our findings will also apply to clinical care by providing an unprecedented level of precision in
prognosis and treatment information."

Cardiovascular complications account for the majority of deaths in diabetic patients. Mitochondrial dysfunction
is central to the disease and it precipitates contractile impairment, leading to death. However, the precise
mechanisms that cause mitochondrial dysfunction in the diabetic heart remain unclear. Using type 2 diabetic
human (patient) and mouse (db/db) models, we observed pronounced disruption to mitochondrial structure and
function, which were associated with the loss of mitochondrial proteins. The vast majority of mitochondrial
proteins are nuclear genome-encoded and require import into the mitochondrion. Import occurs through a
coordinated set of machinery containing an active motor, driven by mitochondrial heat shock protein 70
(mtHsp70). We observed decreased mtHsp70 content in cardiac mitochondria from type 2 diabetic patients and
db/db mice, and a decrease in mitochondrial protein import. Following import, mitochondrial proteins are refolded
into native structures to become functional. MtHsp70 also participates in the refolding process, and works
synergistically with Lon Peptidase 1, Mitochondrial (LonP1), an AAA+ protease of the mitochondrial matrix. We
have also observed a decrease in LonP1 in the type 2 diabetic heart. When mitochondrial protein import is not
functioning properly, aggregated nuclear genome-encoded proteins accumulate on the exterior of the
mitochondrion leading to a phenomenon termed mitochondrial precursor over-accumulation stress. Currently, it
is unclear what factors contribute to a decrease in protein import efficiency and refolding or whether manipulation
of these processes can restore mitochondrial proteomic make-up, mitochondrial function and cardiac contractile
performance in the diabetic heart. Our proposed studies address this critical gap in knowledge. The information
will enhance our understanding of these processes and aid in the development of therapeutic strategies that
target specific import constituents that contribute to loss of mitochondrial proteins. The central hypothesis to be
tested is that decreased protein import and refolding in the type 2 diabetic heart causes loss of mitochondrial
proteins and mitochondrial precursor over-accumulation stress leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and
contractile impairment. The objectives of this application are to (1) identify submitochondrial locations where
protein import is compromised in type 2 diabetic mitochondria and the impact on import machinery; (2) evaluate
the impact of type 2 diabetes mellitus on mitochondrial protein refolding and the synergistic influence of mtHsp70
and LonP1; and (3) determine the extent of mitochondrial and proteomic stress that occurs in the type 2 diabetic
heart, due to failed mitochondrial protein import contributing to mitochondrial precursor over-accumulation stress.
Completion of these studies is expected to provide fundamental molecular insight into the mechanisms
contributing to the loss of nuclear genome-encoded mitochondrial proteins in the type 2 diabetic heart and the
cellular consequences leading to mitochondrial and cardiac dysfunction."
10834972,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Collagen fibers are the primary source of strength and function in tissues throughout the body, particular tendons,
ligaments, and menisci. Cells organize these fibers hierarchically, assemble them from nm-wide fibrils, into larger
fibers and fascicles, growing in size and strength with increasing mechanical demand. Injuries disrupt this
organization, resulting in loss of function, pain, and decreased mobility. Unfortunately, collagen fibers do not
regenerate after injury, nor in engineered replacements, creating a lack of repair options for torn tendons,
ligaments, and menisci. Our long-term goal is to understand how cells regulate collagen fiber formation so to
engineer functional replacements and drive repair in vivo for musculoskeletal tissues throughout the body. As a
step towards this goal, the objective of this proposal is to explore how mechanical cues transmitted via cellular
contraction and stretch-activated ion channels regulate ligament fibroblast’s development of hierarchical fibers.
While cellular contraction forces, highly regulated by integrins, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and the actomyosin
network, are well established to play a major role in collagen fibril alignment, recent work has suggested stretch-
activated ion channels, TRPV4 and Piezo1, also play independent and transient roles in regulating collagen
organization. However, this work is largely confined to 2D surfaces, unorganized collagen gels, or mouse
models, which all lack the larger fibers and fascicles that dominate human musculoskeletal tissues. Recently, we
developed a novel culture device that guides cells to produce native-size hierarchically organized fibrils, fibers, and
fascicles over 6 weeks of culture. This novel system provides the unique ability to finally dissect the mechanical
cues of development and investigate how these forces guide cells to produce strong hierarchical fibers. We
hypothesize mechanical signals via integrin-based contraction and stretch-activated ion channels are critical to
cell-driven hierarchical fiber formation, with each regulating different aspects of fiber maturation, both with and
without dynamic load. Specifically, we hypothesize that while cellular contraction via FAK is critical to progressive
hierarchical development, TRPV4 will regulate alignment and remodeling at the fibril level, and Piezo1 will
regulate matrix maturation via collagen crosslinking at the fiber and fascicle level. In Aim 1 we will evaluate the
contribution of FAK, TRPV4, and Piezo1 in passive static culture when cell-generated contraction forces drive
fiber formation and in Aim 2 we will evaluate how their contribution changes with dynamic mechanical stimulation.
In both aims, we will investigate how each signaling mechanism, when inhibited or activated, alters collagen
organization at the fibril, fiber, and fascicle length-scale, proteoglycan accumulation, and collagen crosslinking,
all important to overall tissue function and mechanics. A better understanding of how mechanical cues drive cells
to produce hierarchical fibers is integral not only to creating functional replacements, but also identifying
therapeutic targets for regenerating collagen fibers after injury, reducing scar formation, and developing optimal
rehabilitation protocols for regenerating musculoskeletal tissues throughout the body."

This proposal focuses on using electrochemistry as an unconventional tool to uncover new organic
reactions and invent synthetic strategies with the goal of facilitating the preparation of bioactive
compounds. Improving the organic synthesis of medicinally active compounds is crucial to modern
biomedical research. In this context, oxidation and reduction reactions are among the most important and
frequently used processes in organic synthesis. However, manipulating the oxidation states of functional
groups in complex settings with high efficiency, precision, and minimal waste remains an important
challenge in modern organic chemistry. Given its many distinct characteristics, electrochemistry
represents an attractive approach to discovering new reactivities, enabling new synthetic strategies, and
meeting the prevailing trends in organic synthesis. Therefore, there exists a clear impetus for the
invention of new reaction strategies to improve the scope of synthetic electrochemistry and provide new
platforms for reaction discovery and synthetic innovations. In the past funding period, we demonstrated
a new catalytic approach that combines electrochemistry and redox-metal catalysis for the oxidative
difunctionalization of alkenes to access a diverse array of highly functionalized structures. These
promising results led us to envision that electrochemistry will ultimately emerge as a powerful tool for
solving a wide range of longstanding synthetic problems. In the new funding cycle, we aim to build upon
our previous success but move our research into new grounds. In each of the projects targeted herein,
we aim to apply electrochemistry to address a prominent challenge in organic synthesis. The
transformations targeted in this grant are either currently unknown or display salient limitations in reaction
scope or selectivity. Among the specific reactions that we aim to develop in the context of this grant are:
two- and three-component cross-electrophile couplings; asymmetric synthesis and late-stage
functionalization of N-containing compounds; and regioselective C–H functionalization of pyridines. In
addition, in-depth studies using canonical physical organic and electroanalytical techniques will provide
insights into the reaction mechanisms. The development and mechanistic understanding of these
proposed transformations will represent significant advances for the field of organic synthesis."

Inositol pyrophosphates (IPPs) are signaling molecules involved in diverse cellular processes from telomere
maintenance and apoptosis to vesicular trafficking and cell migration. Alterations in IPP levels (via mutations in
IPP metabolizing enzymes) are linked to human pathology including cancer, obesity, diabetes and hearing loss.
The pleiotropic effects suggest that inositol pyrophosphates have the ability to control very basic cellular
functions. A role for IPPs in phosphate sensing and phosphate homeostasis is documented in fungi, plants, and
humans. Cells respond to phosphate limitation by inducing the transcription of phosphate acquisition genes, yet
the mechanisms by which this is achieved differ in each taxon. The phosphate (PHO) regulon in the fission yeast
Schizosaccharomyces pombe comprises three genes that specify, respectively, a cell surface acid phosphatase
Pho1, an inorganic phosphate transporter Pho84, and a glycerophosphate transporter Tgp1. Expression of pho1,
pho84, and tgp1 is actively repressed during growth in phosphate-rich medium by RNA polymerase II (Pol2)
transcription in cis of a long noncoding (lnc) RNA from the respective 5' flanking genes prt, prt2, and nc-tgp1.
lncRNA transcription across the PHO mRNA promoter displaces the activating transcription factor Pho7 and
thereby interferes with PHO mRNA expression. The system of lncRNA-mediated transcriptional interference is
sensitive to genetic manipulations that influence 3’-processing/termination. Mutations that elicit “precocious”
lncRNA 3'-processing/termination in response to poly(A) signals upstream of the mRNA promoters lead to de-
repression of pho1, whereas genetic changes that diminish lncRNA termination hyper-repress pho1 expression.
We have exploited this system to discover novel influences on 3’-processing and Pol2 termination. We showed
that: (i) lncRNA transcription is subject to metabolite control by inositol pyrophosphate 1,5-IP8, which acts as an
agonist of precocious 3'-processing/termination; (ii) Spx1, which is composed of an SPX domain and a RING E3
ligase domain, is a likely mediator of IP8 signaling to the 3'-processing/termination machinery; (iii) the 14-3-3
protein Rad24 antagonizes precocious 3’-processing/termination in a manner that depends on its phosphate
binding site; and (iv) Pol2 termination can be enhanced via a gain-of-function mutation in the essential
termination factor Seb1. Specific aims are: (1) to identify targets of the Spx1 E3 ubiquitin ligase (via TULIP2
tagging and mass spectrometry); and to test whether pyrophosphorylation of (or IP8 binding to) components of
the Pol2 machinery contributes to the effects of IP8 on 3’-processing/termination; (2) to leverage new analytical
methods to assess IPP abundance and isoform distribution in fission yeast strains where genetics predicts
changes in IPP content, and to investigate whether and how phosphate starvation impacts cellular IPP content;
(3) To probe the mechanism by which Rad24 antagonizes 3’-processing/termination, by performing ChIP-seq to
identify genes with which Rad24 is associated in vivo; and (4) To generate new gain-of-function mutations in the
essential termination factor Seb1 and analyze their effects on poly(A) site usage, RNA binding, CTD binding."

Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. Recent advancements in the use of immune checkpoint
blockade have transformed oncology, and immunotherapy has extended the potential application of
radiotherapy to systemic disease. More than 200 clinical trials of combined checkpoint blockade and
radiotherapy are ongoing or completed. The results of these preliminary trials demonstrate efficacy only in a
limited subpopulation of patients. Treatment resistance likely manifested by poor T-cell priming and tumor-
mediated immunosuppression continue to constitute significant barriers to optimal patient outcomes; therefore,
the opportunity for transformative clinical impact is real in this setting.
 We propose a new and innovative strategy guided by new findings to improve the interaction of
radiotherapy and immunotherapy by incorporating the latest techniques in the emerging field of mRNA
modification with well-established radiobiological and immunological approaches. We will leverage
collaboration with our Co-Investigator Chuan He, who helped to discover and decipher reversible RNA
methylation in post-transcriptional gene expression regulation. We will use the novel techniques to identify the
binding sites of Y1 and Y2, and incorporate integrated bioinformatics analysis approaches to investigate the
impact of m6A readers in functional pathways of immune cells in irradiated tumors. These techniques are new
and, to our knowledge, have yet to be applied in the context of radiotherapy and radioimmunotherapy.
 We hypothesize that targeting regulation of m6A modifications associated with m6A-binding protein
YTHDF1 (for improved antigen presentation and T-cell priming) and YTHDF2 (for alleviation of
immunosuppression) will potentiate anti-tumor immunity in the context of both RT alone and RT combined with
anti-PD-L1 antibodies. Our proposal focuses on 1) establishing YTHDF1 (Aim 1) and YTHDF2 (Aim 2) as
viable targets for RT and radioimmunotherapy, and 2) uncovering underlying pathways. Small molecules from
the He Lab will be used to validate our hypothesis. The ultimate goal of this therapeutic approach is to
modulate gene expression via targeting m6A methylation related to translation (Y1) or degradation (Y2) of
mRNA in order to potentiate immune response.
 We are uniquely positioned to discover new knowledge and elucidate an unprecedented level of
mechanistic understanding of the complex molecular and cellular interplay between radiotherapy and
checkpoint inhibition in the context of the immune system. These new findings will provide the mechanistic
data required for translational pursuit of superior treatment strategies. Increased local and/or distant control to
actualize radio-immunotherapy would be a practice-changing and would broadly enhance cancer care and
expand the pool of patients who respond to inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis."
10884279,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects more than 10 million individuals worldwide each year (~ 2.8 million in the
USA) and results in long-term motor and cognitive deficits (e.g., reference learning and executive function). To
combat this significant health care issue a variety of relatively invasive experimental therapeutic strategies
have been attempted and have yielded limited translation to the clinic. Environmental enrichment (EE) is a
non-invasive paradigm that promotes significant cognitive recovery and histological protection after
experimental TBI and has the potential to mimic post-TBI clinical rehabilitation. The parent R01 was crafted to
begin refining and optimizing EE after TBI so that it conformed temporally to clinical neurorehabilitation. The
wealth of data lead to a preclinical model of neurorehabilitation that is temporally like the clinic in the sense that
delaying EE for a week (i.e., rehabilitation) and providing only 4-hr per day (as common in the clinic) shows
significant benefits. Overall, the findings provided significant support for EE as a potential model of
neurorehabilitation, but additional empirical research is essential to learn more about its capabilities and
limitations that ultimately strengthen its validity and applicability. Hence, the goal of this renewal is to utilize our
delayed (7 day) and abbreviated (4 h day) EE model of neurorehabilitation, which we refer to as Rehab, to
address questions that concern physiatrists. Five specific aims that are logical and crucial extensions of the
parent grant are proposed: Aim 1a determine whether motor (beam and rotarod), cognitive (spatial learning &
memory, and executive function using the attentional set shifting test that is analogous to the clinical Wisconsin
card sorting task), and affective (open field test) benefits can be sustained after EE is withdrawn, and if so, for
how long, Aim 1b determine if providing “refresher rehab” after the EE-induced benefits begin to wane will
stabilize or re-strengthen benefits, Aims 2abc determine whether “bridging” delayed EE, which is initiated at 7-
days after TBI, with a) [amantadine {10 mg/kg/day; i.p.}], b) aqua therapy [{two 90 s swim sessions}], or c)
music exposure [(3 h per night of New Age, Ambient, or Classical - Mozart’s sonata for two pianos,
K.448)] as adjunct therapies during the week after TBI will augment recovery relative to non-enriched or Rehab
groups, and Aim 3 evaluate mechanisms for the bridge plus Rehab therapies. Completion of the aims will
further advance a model of neurorehabilitation that mimics the real-world while addressing questions that
continue to concern physiatrists, such as how long do the rehab benefits last once discontinued and can they
be maintained or improved further with supplemental rehab? Can supplemental therapies before full rehab
provide a better outcome? What mechanisms are involved in the effects observed? The refined model will
significantly impact and advance rehabilitation-based research. Translatability of the findings will be facilitated
further by optimizing the EE model in adult rats of both sexes and by assessing behavior with sensitive and
clinically-relevant tests of motor and executive function both acutely and long-term."
10875523,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Animals exhibit a remarkable array of creative, adaptive, and flexible behaviors. Birds and primates repurpose
new materials to build nests and tools; rats efficiently construct navigational shortcuts, and humans generalize
knowledge of one language to efficiently speak another. This ability to dynamically create novel behavior in one
or a few trials often depends on compositional planning, or the ability to generate new combinations of a finite
number of simple elements in a goal-directed manner. Despite its central importance for understanding
cognition and its disorders, the neural mechanisms of compositionality remain unknown as there is a dearth of
experimental frameworks for studying compositional planning. To address this critical need for new
approaches, this proposal will elucidate neural mechanisms in a novel drawing task that I have developed in
the Freiwald lab, in which macaques draw copies of never-before-seen visual figures. Subjects’ behavior
exhibits a key signature of compositionality in the ability to construct novel combinations of previously learned
elements to draw new images. I will investigate neural and computational mechanisms for compositional action
planning by integrating this behavioral task two other innovations: (1) large-scale recordings in 12 frontal
cortical areas, each implicated in cognition but never recorded simultaneously, which will allow me to discover
how their distinct functions combine to support cognition (Aim 1), and (2) an integrative analysis framework
building and comparing neural network (Aim 2) and symbolic (Aim 3) computational models of compositional
planning with behavioral and neural data. I will test the main hypothesis that compositionality depends on
neural dynamics implementing symbolic cognitive algorithms in hierarchically organized frontal cortical areas.
These studies are expected to discover the first mechanisms, in neural substrates and dynamics, of
compositional action planning. Further, because of these studies’ intersectional approach - testing neural
network (Aim 2) and symbolic (Aim 3) modeling frameworks on the same data - they may unify these two
influential approaches to cognition, which would be a foundational advance for the neuroscience of
intelligence. Correspondingly, this study will contribute to understanding cognitive disorders, including frontal
planning disorders, and to building brain-machine interfaces that decode cognitive plans from cortical activity.
This award will also provide me with crucial training to prepare me for transitioning to independence. I will train
in computational modeling - building, empirically testing, and interpreting these models - which will support my
use of models to generate and test novel neural circuit and computational hypotheses. I will gain important
career development skills in lab management and leadership, scientific communication, and grant writing,
which will support my long term goal of establishing an independent research program on the neural substrates
of intelligence and creative behavior."
10916394,"A. PROJECT SUMMARY
Skeletal muscle is the most abundant insulin-sensitive tissue in the body making it an important organ system
in the prevention of cardiometabolic disease. Resistance training is the physical activity modality that directly
increases muscle hypertrophy and in doing so increases GLUT4 expression. GLUT4 is an insulin-regulated
glucose transporter with the primary role of stimulating glucose uptake; therefore, hypertrophy leads to
increased insulin sensitivity. Resistance training and enhanced insulin sensitivity have the potential to lower the
burden of cardiovascular and metabolic disease. However, what we know about the role of resistance training on
long-term health outcomes is limited by the blunt tools currently used to measure resistance training in
longitudinal epidemiologic studies. Progress in the physical activity epidemiology field is limited because
resistance training volume is not measured in population studies with the same level of precision as aerobic
activity and as a result, we do not know the optimal balance of movements to promote health across the life
course. The objective of the proposed research is to ameliorate the gap in assessing resistance training volume at
an epidemiological level and assess how resistance training volume affects cardiovascular and metabolic disease
independently and jointly with aerobic activity. The training will enable the scientific objectives of this
application, which are to evaluate the independent and joint associations of resistance training with estimates of
insulin resistance and blood pressure. This award will provide Dr. Booker with added training in 1) survey
development, 2) resistance training, 3) cohort development, and 4) biostatistics. Training will take place at
Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, supported by a strong team of mentors from multiple
peer institutions with expertise in each of these areas. In the K99 phase, Dr. Booker will develop and validate an
epidemiological instrument to collect resistance training volume (Aim 1) and identify the age group where the
instrument performs the best. During the R00 phase, Dr. Booker will use the instrument to determine the
association of resistance training volume with estimates of insulin resistance and blood pressure (Aim 2). He will
then determine the optimal ratio of movement behaviors for estimates of insulin resistance and blood pressure
(Aim 3). The proposed training and research will propel Dr. Booker towards successfully achieving his long-term
research goal of developing tailored physical activity training programs to promote ideal cardiovascular and
metabolic health. Resistance training has emerged among the top fitness trends worldwide and has the potential
to serve as another tool to lower the burden of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases."

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus) is a prototypic autoimmune disease that causes severe systemic
manifestations, of which nephritis is the major cause of morbidity and mortality. SLE primarily affects young
women, with African American patients showing much earlier and more severe disease than European
Americans. An important feature of SLE is the expression of antibodies to nuclear molecules (anti-nuclear
antibodies (ANAs)). ANAs provide serological markers for diagnosis, classification, and disease activity. While
there has been extensive study of the pathogenesis of SLE, much remains unknown about the underlying
mechanisms that promote inflammation and renal injury. As a result, SLE treatment is empiric and frequently
ineffective. Current treatments can cause permanent organ damage and severe side effects, providing a strong
rationale for the mechanistic studies necessary for more effective and less toxic therapies. In patients as well as
animal models of SLE, the formation of immune complexes by ANAs is a key step in inflammation and injury. Of
ANAs that can form immune complexes, antibodies to DNA (anti-DNA) have a prominent and well-validated role
in nephritis, as shown by the isolation of anti-DNA from affected kidneys of patients, as well as the induction of
nephritis in animal models by administration of monoclonal anti-DNA antibodies. While most models for immune
complexes are based on antibody interaction with soluble protein or nucleic acid antigens of relatively low
molecular weight, recent research suggests that immune complexes in SLE form on cell-generated particles
known as extracellular vesicles. We propose that DNA can adsorb onto the surface of these particles to form a
“corona” that provides a target for anti-DNA antibodies. The significance of this research is the development of
well-controlled synthetic DNA-particles to address fundamental questions about the immunological properties of
particles that are not addressable with naturally occurring particles. The outcome of this research will be the
understanding of the mechanisms by which DNA binds to particles to form an antigenic substrate; the formation
of immune complexes by particles; the effects of surface DNA on the interaction of particles with immune cells;
and the role of surface DNA in immune stimulation. Aim 1 will determine the antigenicity of DNA adsorbed on
particles as a function of particle diameter, DNA length, and a protein corona using a previously developed
antibody binding assay as a readout. Aim 2 will use the antigenic particles identified in Aim 1 to elucidate the
immunostimulatory activity of DNA-particles in vitro, measuring the immune response and cellular internalization
of the DNA-particles. The development of a well-controlled synthetic particle system provides an innovative
approach to the study of SLE. Beyond SLE, the role of naturally occurring, cell-generated particles as elements
in disease pathogenesis has important implications for other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

Evidence indicates that disruptions in loss and reward valuation exist across traditional psychiatric diagnostic
categories, and these elements are featured in the NIMH Research Domain Criteria matrix. However,
validating these features of the RDoC matrix and determining the translational utility of loss and reward
valuation requires at least three critical advances: i) understanding the elements’ relational structure (i.e., to
what extent are loss and reward valuation linked or distinct), ii) establishing the functional relevance of
valuation measures (i.e., which features of loss and reward valuation are related to which symptoms), and iii)
determining the stability or lack thereof of the elements and relationships between the elements (i.e.,
determining which valuation features are state-like vs trait-like). To work toward validating valuation elements
and their relevance to psychopathology, we respond to RFA-MH-19-242 (Computational Approaches for
Validating Dimensional Constructs of Relevance to Psychopathology). Specifically, we take a data-driven,
computational psychiatry approach merging clinical and experimental data to delineate relationships among
computationally derived components of loss and reward valuation and with symptoms in a large sample of
participants with clinically significant mood, anxiety, or anhedonia (Aim 1). In Aims 2 and 3, we incorporate a
mechanistic trial to assess whether components of and relationships between loss and reward valuation are
sensitive to change a) over time, b) following 12 sessions of instructed valuation (Aim 2), or c) following
cognitive behavioral therapy (Aim 3). If successful, we believe there is immense opportunity to bridge
behaviorally-oriented clinicians and computational (neuro)scientists and advance the field by mapping
symptoms to neuromechanistic disease processes and spurring the development of new neurobehaviorally-
guided treatment approaches. As required by the RFA, this application assesses multiple constructs (loss and
reward valuation constructs and learning subconstructs) in the Negative and Positive Valence RDoC domains,
using multiple tasks and levels of data."

10783083,"Chronic pain affects more than 50 million Americans per year, resulting in extraordinary
personal and societal costs. Adding to the dilemma, deaths involving prescription opiate
analgesics have almost quadrupled in the last ten years. The clinical challenge of pain
management is underscored by evidence that chronic pain is mechanistically distinct from acute
pain, therefore a thorough understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying
the transition to chronic pain is fundamental to improving and expanding treatment options.
Hyperalgesic priming is a compelling model of the transition to chronic pain in which an initial
injury resolves, but leaves the animal in a primed state in which a second insult induces a
greatly prolonged pain response. Experiments proposed here will examine the impact of
mitochondrial dynamics on the development of acute and chronic inflammatory pain compared
to a nerve injury model of neuropathic pain, and will explore molecular mechanisms mediating
proposed anti-nociceptive actions of endogenous uncoupling mechanisms and mitochondrial
uncoupling drugs. Specific Aim 1 will examine the how mitochondrial function changes in
response to noxious insult and the impact of mitochondrial regulation on acute hyperalgesia in
sensory ganglia. Specific Aim 2 will use patch clamp electrophysiology to demonstrate changes
in electrical properties of sensory neurons in response to manipulation of mitochondrial function,
and will identify cell signaling pathways that mediate mitochondrial effects on neuronal
excitability. Specific Aim 3 will characterize changes in mitochondrial function unique to the
transition to chronic pain, and will elucidate cell signaling pathways modulating the impact of
mitochondrial function on inflammatory and neuropathic pain chronification. This proposal will
use innovative approaches to explore novel mechanisms by which mitochondria influence the
manifestation of acute and chronic pain, and test the therapeutic potential of targeting these
mechanisms for pain relief."

Neurons in the brain are submerged into oscillating extracellular Local Field Potential (LFP) created by
synchronized synaptic currents. The dynamics of these oscillations is one of the principal characteristics
of the brain activity at all levels: from the individual neurons’ spiking to the activity of networks that underlie
high-level cognitive processes. However, our interpretation of the LFP structure and functions depend on
the techniques that we use for data analyses. The oscillatory nature of LFP motivates using Fourier
methods, which have dominated LFP research for decades and currently constitute the only systematic
framework for understanding the “brain rhythms.” Yet these methods poorly handle two fundamental
attributes of biological signals: noise and non-stationarity, and may therefore obscure the structure of the
LFP data and its physiological meaning. We have recently adapted a powerful technique that previously
applied to studying complex physical signals (e.g., gravitational waves, magnetic resonances, etc.) for
nuanced analysis of the LFP oscillations. By applying this method, we discovered that hippocampal and
cortical LFPs recorded in rodents consist of a few frequency-modulated waves, which we call Oscillons.
We hypothesize that these objects represent the actual, physical structure of the brain waves and hence
may hold keys to better understanding of the circuit mechanisms of learning and memory. Another
principal feature of our method is an impartial marker of the noise component, which allows us to identify
and remove the “noise shell” from the signal and then to investigate not only the noise itself, but also the
interplays between the noise and the regular, oscillatory part of the signal, their interactions with neuronal
spiking, etc.
Since Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is characterized by alterations in both the oscillatory and stochastic
activity in the hippocampal network, the quest of better understanding of AD-induced pathologies fits
ideally the strengths of our approach. Our goal is to use it for studying the circuit mechanisms of AD and
to learn to manipulate the network activity through our methodology."

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of liver cancer and fourth
leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. The incidence of HCC is rising as key risk factors
including obesity and heavy alcohol consumption are accelerating at rates greater than ever
before. These risk factors drive hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis, marked by the extreme
accumulation of lipid droplets (LDs) in hepatocytes, leading to cirrhosis and HCC. While
lipid synthesis a well-described phenotype in HCC, the role of LDs in propagating tumor
formation and growth is poorly understood. Preliminary data from our laboratory suggests that
the small GTPase Rab5 localizes to LDs and plays a critical role in trafficking to the
lysosome, where LDs are catabolized by lysosomal acid lipase (LAL). Moreover, both Rab5
and LAL expression are increased in HCC tumors, consistent with cell biological studies
showing elevated lipophagy in HCC cell lines vs normal hepatocytes. These data support
the hypothesis that Rab5-LD interaction drives HCC tumor growth via lysosomal catabolism.
In Aim 1, we will determine the mechanisms of Rab5 binding to LDs in HCC, and how this
interaction impacts cancer cell energetics and proliferation. In Aim 2, we will determine the
impact of Rab5-mediated lipophagy on HCC tumor growth in vivo using a sleeping beauty
transposon transposase (SBTT) mouse model in which oncogenes are delivered to hepatocytes
via hydrodynamic tail vein injection (HTVI). The results gained from the proposed research will
provide a mechanistic understanding of lipid droplet trafficking and catabolism in
hepatocellular carcinoma progression. Moreover, this research will aid in future development of
larger research project grant applications."

The economic and public health burden of neurological diseases are remarkably high in Bangladesh with 5,344
cases per 100,000 people. Yet, the etiology of neurological disorders with respect to environmental pollutants,
particularly toxic metals such as arsenic (As), lead (Pb), manganese (Mn), and cadmium (Cd), is poorly
understood. These metals co-exist at moderate to high levels posing additional risk to children. Recent
Bangladesh studies, including our own, have shown neurobehavioral (NB) effects associated with single metal
exposure in children living in the rural areas. These detrimental effects, often subtle, potentially have long-term
impact on the educational, social, and economic development of the population. This is, in part, due to the limited
research capacity of local Bangladeshi researchers to properly evaluate the impact of mixed metal-induced
impairment on brain function. To address this fundamental gap in critical research capacity, we plan to improve
the research skills of Bangladeshi scientists by providing them the necessary training to appropriately investigate
children’s brain vulnerability induced by metal co-exposure.
 The proposed study has assembled a group of U.S. investigators from Sam Houston State University,
Columbia University, the University of Houston, Baylor College of Medicine, and the University of Iowa. The U.S.
scientists will collaborate with the Bangladeshi researchers and faculty from the International Center for Diarrheal
Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b), Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), the largest
medical university in Bangladesh, and North South University (NSU). Our goal is to improve the research
capacity of scientists and clinicians by (i) organizing in-country and virtual yearly workshops/training and
symposia on neuro-epidemiological research methodology and manuscript preparation; (ii) providing within the
U.S. (and virtually), training on various neurobehavioral (NB) evaluation tools and data analysis; and (iii) involving
the local researchers in two proposed epidemiological studies to be conducted in Bangladesh.
 In the first study, 600 adolescents from the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS) cohort in
Araihazar will be evaluated for NB performance. Concurrently, adolescent blood samples will be analyzed for
metals and thyroid hormone (TH) since metals are known to disrupt TH prenatally leading to poor NB
performance in childhood. Free thyroxine (fT4), total triiodothyronine (tT3), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH),
thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb), and thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) will be analyzed. The Behavioral
Assessment and Research System (BARS) battery will be used for NB assessment. The second study will recruit
200 mother-child pairs from the Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) area in Matlab to assess
if maternal metal mixture exposure is associated with TH disruption in early pregnancy, and in turn, if prenatal
disruption of TH interferes with NB performance in young children. Together, these two studies will test if metal-
induced neurotoxicity in early life, in part, mediate the relationships between metal co-exposure and NB."

This proposal will leverage unprecedented data from a Dutch birth cohort to examine the influence of phthalate
and bisphenol exposures in multiple potentially susceptible periods on executive function and behavior in
adolescents. Substantial literature has investigated the negative impact of prenatal exposures to phthalates
and bisphenols on developmental programming of cognition and behavior. Yet few studies have examined
exposures beyond early childhood. Further, the rigor of earlier studies is limited due to the lack of focus on
mechanisms and failure to apply a life course approach. We propose to measure urinary levels of phthalates
and bisphenols at ages 9–10 and 13–14 years in ≈ 1000 participants of Generation R, the largest
neuroimaging study in the general pediatric population enrolled prenatally with follow-up through adolescence.
We will evaluate executive function and behavior in children at age 16–18 years and measure sex hormones.
Available data on measures of chemicals during the prenatal period and at 5–6 years, thyroid function in both
mother and child, brain magnetic resonance imaging at ages 9–10 and 13–14 years, and feasibility of follow-up
during adolescence provide an exceptional opportunity to parse out neurotoxic effects of pre- and postnatal
exposures and identify the mechanisms. The large sample size will allow assessing sex as a biological
variable. Specific aims are 1) to determine the impact of prenatal, childhood, and early adolescent phthalate
and bisphenol exposures on executive function and behavior in adolescents and 2) to examine potential
mechanisms underlying adverse influences of phthalates and bisphenols including thyroid and sex hormone
disruption as well as brain structural abnormalities and white matter integrity. We hypothesize that chemical
exposures during childhood and adolescence are associated with impaired executive function and behavioral
problems, independent of prenatal exposure. Perturbations of thyroid and sex hormones are hypothesized to
partly explain this association. We expect to observe the impact of childhood and early adolescence exposures
on parietal lobe, attention networks, and prefrontal and limbic tracts, independent of the global effect of
prenatal chemical exposures. This proposal is grounded on evidence showing that significant growth and
maturation of the adolescent brain occurs in response to hormonal changes. Our preliminary data show anti-
androgenic effects of di-2-ethylhexylphthalate in adolescents and thyroid disruption by prenatal phthalate and
bisphenol exposures. Because of similarities in exposure levels in this Dutch cohort and the US samples,
findings of this study will be applicable to the US context. Understanding the neurotoxicity of phthalates and
bisphenols during adolescence has high implications because the plasticity of the adolescent brain makes this
period a time of considerable opportunity for intervention. If the adolescent brain is found to be affected by
chemicals then guidance in regulations of chemical exposures beyond the prenatal period might be indicated."

Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), which lack a fixed three-dimensional structure under
physiological conditions, represent ~40% of the human proteome, have crucial functional roles in a variety
of biological pathways and biomolecular assemblies and are implicated in a large number of human
diseases. As IDPs populate a dynamic conformational ensemble of rapidly interconverting structures in
solution, and cannot be represented by a single dominant conformation, or even a small number of
substantially populated conformations, they are not suitable targets for conventional structure-based drug
design methods. If it becomes possible to target IDPs with small molecule drugs, the druggable proteome
will be dramatically expanded and therapeutic interventions may become accessible for currently
untreatable diseases
The PI’s laboratory utilizes an integrated computational and experimental research strategy to combine
state-of-the-art all-atom molecular simulations with experimental measurements from NMR spectroscopy
and other biophysical experiments to obtain atomistic descriptions of the dynamic binding mechanisms of
IDPs and uses insights form these binding mechanisms to predict and rationally design novel binding
interactions. This proposal focuses on applying this integrated computational and experimental approach
to elucidate the binding mechanisms of small molecule drug candidates that target that intrinsically
disordered domain of the androgen receptor and have entered clinical trials for castration resistant prostate
cancer (CRPC). These binding mechanisms will be used to inform the rational design more potent and
selective androgen receptor inhibitors and more effective CRPC therapeutics
. This proposal describes a
remarkable opportunity to draw connections between molecular binding mechanisms studied by molecular
simulations and NMR, biological activity observed in cellular assays, and clinical results from human
CRPC drug trials.
This proposal will initiate a sustainable long-term research effort to combine computational and
experimental methods to study the dynamic interactions of IDPs in a variety of cellular and pharmaceutical
contexts. This research effort will stimulate the development of robust platforms to integrate computational
and experimental methods that will dramatically increase the number of proteins amenable to structural and
mechanistic characterization and pharmaceutical targeting and will provide new avenues to therapeutic
interventions in diseases associated with aberrant biological interactions of IDPs such as those mediated by
biomolecular condensate formation and protein misfolding."

By governing growth and quiescence, nutrient-responsive pathways are central to cancer, diabetes and aging.
The function of these pathways in starvation informs understanding of their dysfunction in disease, but their
fundamental role in starvation is not well understood. The premise of this proposal is that multiple tumor sup-
pressors are known to promote starvation resistance, but their regulatory relationships and effector mecha-
nisms are unclear. The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate the genetic foundation and molecular
mechanisms of starvation resistance in C. elegans as a model for human disease. Worms are an ideal model
since they thrive in feast and famine with remarkable ability to endure starvation. Genes known to promote
starvation resistance in C. elegans (eg, daf-18/PTEN, daf-16/FoxO, lin-35/Rb, hlh-30/TFEB and aak-2/AMPK)
have conserved function in suppressing tumors, regulating metabolism, and promoting longevity. However,
significant gaps in understanding remain. Preliminary studies show that inhibition of PI3K signaling does not
account for the effect of DAF-18/PTEN on starvation resistance. They show that DAF-18/PTEN's protein-
phosphatase activity promotes starvation resistance, and they identify a novel protein target. Preliminary re-
sults also suggest that DAF-16/FoxO and LIN-35/Rb regulate histone variants to mediate nutritional control of
chromatin structure and gene regulation. They also demonstrate the efficacy of an innovative population-
sequencing approach for analysis of quantitative traits, and they identify novel genes affecting natural variation
in starvation resistance. These include modifiers of insulin/IGF signaling and a conserved but uncharacterized
transcription factor. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a conserved network of tumor suppressors
and proto-oncogenes governs starvation resistance through a variety of effector mechanisms. The objective of
this proposal is to expand understanding of this network by identifying novel components, regulatory interac-
tions, and effector mechanisms. The central hypothesis is supported by strong preliminary data and the litera-
ture. It will be tested with the following three aims: 1) Identify DAF-18/PTEN targets that promote starvation
resistance, 2) Identify gene regulatory mechanisms that mediate adaptation to starvation, and 3) Identify genes
and mechanisms that contribute to natural variation in starvation resistance. Genetic, genomic and biochemical
approaches will be used to complete these aims. This work is technically innovative for using population se-
quencing to leverage the power of deep sequencing for statistical genetics, and for using gene expression as a
high-dimensional trait for epistasis analysis. It is intellectually innovative for hypothesizing a novel regulatory
relationship between clinically important tumor suppressors. The contributions of the proposed work will be
identification of novel components, regulatory interactions and effector mechanisms of the regulatory network
governing starvation resistance. These contributions will be significant because starvation resistance is a fun-
damental trait intimately related to human health and disease, and genes under investigation are conserved."
10806184,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major risk factor for early-onset dementia and Alzheimer’s
Disease among Veterans. Cumulative evidence from clinical follow-up of returning Veterans

non-TBI Veterans. The current interventions for post-TBI dementia are limited, and there are
currently no interventions that have shown to prevent, stop, or reverse cognitive decline in
Veterans who have experienced either mild or severe TBI. Data from animal models of TBI
indicate a role for the neuroinflammatory response in mediating pathological neurodegeneration
after TBI, but characteristics of the neuroinflammatory response, both spatially in the brain and
temporally in relation to cognitive deficits in chronic TBI, has not been explored. In this context,
we have shown that following TBI in mice, there is a robust neuroinflammatory which is observed
at least 6 months after TBI. We have also shown that the complement system is a prominent
trigger of this neuroinflammatory response after TBI. In this project, we propose to investigate the
hypothesis that post-traumatic complement activation and neuroinflammation, that occurs and
persists in the brain following TBI, leads to failure of compensatory mechanisms in primary
cognitive centers of the brain leading to early onset neurodegeneration that is accelerated in an
Alzheimer’s disease mouse model."
10885938,"Spinal cord injuries (SCI) are among the most debilitating conditions an individual can sustain with the
estimates of SCI incidence in the United States at 12,000 new cases per year. The loss of innervation to the
tissues muscle below the level of the lesion results in reduced physical activity which leads to an array of
secondary complications including muscle atrophy, cardiovascular and metabolic disease, obesity and
vascular dysfunction. This further leads to exercise intolerance, reduced quality of life and depression.
Although current rehabilitative programs focus on improving muscle strength in this population, the efficacy
of these programs is challenged by the injury related motor impairment, which limits the exercise intensity
and subsequent positive muscular adaptations. Therefore, development of an exercise program that
promotes maximal muscular adaptations to light intensity exercise could greatly improve the efficacy of
rehabilitation in the SCI population and help restore functional capacity and quality of life for these individuals.
Blood flow restriction (BFR) exercise has shown tremendous promise for improving muscle size and strength
in a variety of healthy and clinical populations, however the benefits of BFR exercise for those with SCI has
not been established. Thus, the purpose of this Merit proposal is to conduct a comprehensive study that
explores the benefits and risks of BFR exercise in the incomplete SCI population. In general individuals with
chronic incomplete SCI will be recruited to partake in two 8-week training periods (20 sessions) that involve
traditional knee extension/flexion exercise or knee extension/flexion exercise with blood flow restriction.
There will be a series of measurements before and after the 8-week intervention to look at changes in muscle
and vascular function. Specific Aim 1 will determine how the 8-weeks of BFR exercise influenced muscle
strength (Biodex isokinetic dynamometer), muscle cross sectional area and volume (CTscan) and fatigue
resistance. Specific Aim 2 will determine how this novel 8-week training intervention impacts peripheral
vascular function. Specifically, changes in nitric oxide mediated endothelial function will be determined
through tests of flow mediated dilation, changes in endothelial function of the microvascular network will be
determined through assessments of reactive hyperemia and changes in arterial stiffness will be determined
through measurements of pulse wave velocity. Specific Aim 3 will focus on the safety of BFR exercise for
the SCI population. Those with SCI are at greater risk for thrombosis and DVT compared to able bodied
individuals. Although unlikely, the introduction of temporary blood stasis during BFR exercise might augment
this risk. Thus, the third aim of this study will be to determine changes in innate immune activation and
thrombosis risk. Specifically, blood will be collected at multiple timepoints throughout the training intervention
and analyzed for hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha, neutrophil extra cellular traps (which act as prothrombotic
scaffolds), neutrophil-platelet aggregates and inflammatory cytokines. Ultimately, if the improvements in
muscle and vascular function following BFR resistance exercise is greater than the traditional resistance
exercise often performed in rehabilitation settings, without increasing risk for DVT, it should be incorporated
into the long-term rehabilitation programs for veterans with SCI."

(Sutterwala), and field studies of acute febrile illness (Reller and Woods). With the description of many new
leptospiral genomes, a striking pattern of massive species diversity has emerged leading to central hypothesis
#1, which is that a core set of leptospiral virulence factors have evolved with roles in survival in mammalian host
phagocytes, translocation, and dissemination, which are upregulated in response to the host microenvironment.
Central hypothesis #1 will be tested by correlating genome-scale leptospiral evolutionary changes with virulence
phenotypes, examining the roles of transcriptional regulators and non-coding small RNAs in adaptation to and
survival within host phagocytes, and translocation across endothelial barriers. The correlation of inflammatory
markers such as IL-1β levels with disease severity leads to central hypothesis #2, which is that human
inflammatory response pathways drive disease outcomes. Central hypothesis #2 will be tested in vitro
(interactions with macrophages and endothelial cells), in animal models (infections in hamsters and mice), and
in human field studies in Tanzania, Nicaragua, and Sri Lanka. Specifically, we will follow up on our innovative
discovery of a striking dichotomy between the high level of inflammasome activation in human macrophages
and the low level in macrophages from mice, which are reservoir hosts and do not exhibit disease. We will also
follow up on our innovative discovery of dramatic disruption of endothelial VE-cadherins by pathogenic
leptospires in terms of the role of intercellular invasion in dissemination. Animal model studies will provide
longitudinal host response data in support of human studies that will have a positive impact through
development and validation of rapid biomarker diagnostic and triage tools to identify serious infections at an
early stage when antibiotics and other interventions can prevent and/or treat critical illness including fatal
hepatorenal failure."

The decreasing quality of oocytes, associated with maternal age, is a major component of
reduced fertility in older women. Many molecular markers are observed in deteriorating oocytes,
including transcriptomic changes. Interestingly, in most animal models, the end of oogenesis and
early embryogenesis proceed in the absence of transcription, relying on stored messenger RNAs
(mRNAs). The developing oocyte carefully manages different populations of RNA during
maturation, fertilization, and zygotic genome activation to successfully jumpstart embryogenesis.
The accumulation of these maternal transcripts during oogenesis is therefore essential. Yet we
know very little of how the transcriptome is sculpted after the transcriptional machinery is
inactivated. What drives transcriptomic changes and how are they contributing to oocyte quality?
RNA tailing, or the addition of untemplated nucleotides to the 3' end of RNA molecules, is a post-
transcriptional process that has long been associated with the regulation of RNA stability and
translation. Both nucleotide composition and length of tails can determine tail function. RNA tails
are especially dynamic in the germline and the early embryo. The objective of this work is to
identify the terminal nucleotidyl transferases and exonuclease that modulate RNA tails and to
elucidate the mechanism that mediate the downstream effects on RNA stability and translation in
the oocyte. First, I will examine the physiological function of TNTs and exonucleases in C. elegans
fertility. Second, I will characterize changes in RNA tail length and composition during oogenesis
and early embryogenesis to shed light on conserved pathways involved in generating viable and
competent oocytes. Third, I will identify the co-factors that act upstream and downstream of TNTs
and exonucleases, to coordinate their activity, and modulate tail-mediated regulation of RNA
stability and translation. I am uniquely qualified to conduct this research, having studied different
types of RNA and their biology throughout my graduate and postdoctoral training. In Katherine
McJunkin’s laboratory, I have used the C. elegans model system and large-scale genomic
screens to identify TNTs responsible for miRNA tailing and to assess its impact on microRNA
turnover. In the proposed work, I will apply state-of-the-art techniques to dissect the machinery
responsible for mRNA tailing in the context of reproduction and fertility. This work seeks to explore
post-transcriptional mechanisms regulating gene expression during the oocyte-to-embryo
transition and their contribution to oocyte quality."
10813164,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Understanding financial exploitation among older adults is an important public health issue; however, the
reasons why some older adults may be more susceptible to fraud are poorly understood. To address this, I
have developed a program of research focused on understanding the diverse behavioral, contextual, and
neurobiological factors that impact financial decision making and financial exploitation vulnerability in older
age. This program of research leverages extramurally-funded USC-based resources and collaborative
endeavors with the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Center (RADC), which together provide trainees the opportunity
to work with diverse datasets and research mentors. Age-related decline in cognitive abilities impacting
financial decision making is believed to be a central risk factor for fraud in older age. Those with Alzheimer’s
Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) are believed to be most at risk
for financial exploitation. However, most of this research is based either on indirect or anecdotal evidence.
Relatedly, cognitive symptom profiles of those with ADRD who experience scam and fraud are unknown.
Neuroimaging work has implicated the structure and connectivity of specific brain regions as neurobiological
mechanisms; however, these have yet to be implicated in ADRD patients specifically. Importantly, since factors
associated with Alzheimer’s Disease are known to differ by race, and rates of financial fraud appear to differ
according to race, an understanding of these differences is a scientifically crucial. To address these questions,
the research project for this K24 Career Development Award proposes to expand the current program of
research by investigating the associations between financial fraud and ADRD in the Health and Retirement
Study (HRS) and the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Center (RADC) cohorts. The HRS is considered the largest
and most nationally-representative study of aging in the United States. In 2016, the HRS initiated Module 2,
which introduced financial fraud items into the survey. Since 2013, the RADC has collected financial decision
making and neuroimaging data as an integrated part of their large, community-based, neuroepidemiologic
studies of aging, and I have been an active collaborator on many of these studies. A proposed mentoring team
consisting of USC and RADC faculty will provide me and my mentees guidance in mentorship, professional
development, and current research approaches in the HRS and RADC cohorts. Finally, because financial
vulnerability in non-demented older adults has recently been associated with greater risk for Alzheimer’s
Disease in longitudinal models, we secondarily aim to explore the association of preclinical Alzheimer’s
Disease blood-based biomarkers with financial exploitation risk in a subset of local older adults without
cognitive impairment. This mid-career award will address financial vulnerability considerations in ADRD."

To determine the anatomical basis of complex neural behavior, it is critical to have the ability to
trace more than one circuit simultaneously in the same animal. That’s because complex animal
behaviors or neural computation should be understood through the interaction of more than one
circuit – cooperative, antagonistic, or else. In addition, it is necessary to rapidly capture the
connectivity information in the dynamically changing brains during development and learning.
Engineered G-deleted rabies is a current state-of-art method to retrogradely trace the presynaptic
input neurons of a defined cell type. However, it remains unfeasible to trace more than one neural
circuit simultaneously. In addition, the current approach using AAV helpers and rabies requires
several weeks for tracing. In this proposed research, we will overcome these disadvantages by
developing two novel trans-synaptic viral tracer systems: SWORD: Sendai with Orthogonal
Rabies Duplex Tracing (Aim 1) and a rapid TRIO/cTRIO: cell-type specific tracing the relationship
between input and output (Aim 2). This research is significant because these new methods will
allow more comprehensive analysis of neural connectivity in more than one circuit and in more
diverse context such as the developing brain where distinct synaptic networks emerge and neural
plasticity such as learning across many model species. The proposed research is innovative,
because we are developing and validating technically innovative solutions, SWORD and rapid
TRIO/cTRIO, to overcome the limitations of the current state-of-the art tracing method. These
viral-genetic tools will have a positive and broad impact on the neuroscience field as it will
enhance our understanding of neural circuit organization for the complex behaviors and help to
identify the circuit-specific therapeutic targets to cure brain disorders."
10913369,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Targeting mitochondrial metabolism is an active area of research in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).
The cumulative data indicate that AML cells have heightened mitochondrial activity and prefer glutamine as a
carbon source compared to noncancerous cells. Nevertheless, a challenge that emerges when trying to target
these vulnerabilities one at a time is the continued presence of treatment-refractory AML cells, which ultimately
result in relapse or developed resistance. The likely causes are the adaptable nature of metabolic pathways
and cell-to-cell variability, either due to local environment or genetics.
 We propose that loss of mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) will simultaneously
block multiple metabolic pathways used by AML with minimal toxicity in healthy cells. We recently published
that the SLC25A51 transporter is a critical regulator of mitochondrial NAD+ levels in human cells. SLC25A51 is
directly responsible for NAD+ import, and modulation of SLC25A51 expression controls the concentrations of
NAD+ in the mitochondrial matrix. Loss of SLC25A51 resulted in depleted NAD+ only in mitochondria and not
throughout the whole cell. Until now, there has been no way to selectively deplete mitochondrial NAD+ through
an endogenous target. Notably, we have found a broad vulnerability across AML cells to SLC25A51 depletion,
including lines that previously were found to escape Complex I inhibition.
 This proposal will determine the extent that SLC25A51 impacts AML in vivo, elucidate the pathways
that this transporter supports, and determine the molecular mechanisms controlling its expression. As there are
limited treatment options for patients, the long-term benefit of this work is to establish a rationale for targeting
mitochondrial NAD+ through SLC25A51 and to identify additional AML therapeutic approaches."
10817076,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chronic migraine is highly debilitating, poorly understood, and with limited treatment options. Although the
activation of many pro-inflammatory immune cells has been shown to contribute to migraine pathophysiology,
the involvement of CD3+ T lymphocytes, especially the immunosuppressive regulatory T (Treg) cells, in
migraine chronification and reversal remains unknown. We will address the knowledge gap in this application.
 Some migraine patients exhibit numerical or functional impairment of Treg cell in the peripheral blood. In a
mouse model of chronic migraine, repeated administration of nitroglycerin (NTG, a reliable trigger of migraine
in patients) not only induced persistent behavioral sensitization, but also doubled the number of CD3+ T cells in
the trigeminal ganglia (TG) without altering the number of Treg cells, again suggesting a loss of balance
between immune activation and suppression. Repeated NTG also increased the number of TG neurons that
can be activated by neuropeptides calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-
activating polypeptide (PACAP), indicating the sensitization of TG neurons. Low-dose interleukin-2 (ld-IL2)
treatment, which preferentially expands and activates endogenous Treg cells, completely reversed chronic
migraine-related behavioral sensitizations without altering basal nociceptive responses. Ld-IL2 also effectively
reduced the number of CGRP- and PACAP-responsive TG neurons in NTG-treated mice to the control level.
Mechanistically, we found that both peripheral transforming growth factor beta (TGF) and interleukin-10 (IL10)
signaling are required for ld-IL2 to reverse chronic migraine-related behavioral and cellular sensitizations.
 In this application, we propose to test the hypothesis that neuro-immune interactions contribute to the
development and resolution of chronic migraine, likely through regulating the sensitivity of TG neurons in the
trigeminovascular pathway. First, we will selectively deplete CD4+ or CD8+ T cells to determine which T cell
subset(s) contribute to the development and resolution of chronic headache-related sensitizations. We will then
use flow cytometry to further investigate which T cell subtype(s) within CD4+ and CD8+ cells are altered by
repeated NTG. Secondly, to further elucidate how Tregs and ld-IL2 reverses migraine chronification, we will
examine whether ld-IL2 increases TGFβ1 and IL10 in Treg cells in TG and dura. Treg-selective gene knockout
strategy and adoptive transfer of Treg cells will be employed to determine whether Treg cells are the main
source of TGF1 and IL10 that mediate the effects of ld-IL2. Lastly, we will test whether repeated NTG
increases CGRP and/or PACAP peptide expression in TG neurons. Conditional KO mice will be used to
selectively eliminate CGRP or PACAP signaling in primary afferent neurons. We will ask whether headache
chronification is entirely or partially mediated through CGRP and PACAP signaling in TG neurons.
 Collectively, results from this study will not only shed light on how neuro-immune interactions regulate
migraine chronification and reversal, but also facilitate mechanism-based drug discovery."

Glaucoma, the most common worldwide cause of irreversible blindness, is characterized by progressive
dysfunction and death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). We recently employed confocal scanning laser
ophthalmoscopy (cSLO) to successfully obtain in vivo Ca2+ imaging with mouse RGCs expressing jGCaMP7s, a
genetically encoded calcium indicator. Thousands of ON, OFF, and ON-OFF RGCs with characteristic responses
to light stimulation are readily detected in living animals through this non-invasive in vivo imaging platform. Here
we seek to develop a more advanced, first-of-its-kind two-photon (2P)-SLO platform with patterned stimulation
and multiple detection channels. Through a multidisciplinary collaboration with expertise in in vivo optical
imaging, RGC pathophysiology, and retinal neural circuitry and visual processing, we will use complementary
imaging techniques and state-of-the-art analysis protocols to understand naïve RGC physiology in real time. We
recently extended our original mouse silicone oil-induced pupillary blocking and ocular hypertension (SOHU)
model to recapitulate phenotypes of two forms of glaucoma: a chronic model with moderate IOP elevation and
mild RGC neurodegeneration; and an acute model with greatly elevated IOP and severe neurodegeneration.
Importantly, SO removal reduces IOP to normal almost immediately, allowing better exploration of the effects of
IOP lowering treatment and combined treatment with neuroprotection strategies. Thus, we will determine the
longitudinal functional and metabolic changes of glaucomatous RGCs, under clinically relevant models, both
before and after IOP normalization and/or neuroprotective treatments. These data will deepen our understanding
of the pathophysiology of glaucoma, towards finding much-sought biomarkers to better predict progression, and
create more relevant endpoints for developing treatment to restore RGC physiology in vivo."
10893014,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Membrane proteins (MPs) are molecules that can be found in membranes on the surface and the
inside of all cells. They enable vital cellular functions such as transport of water, salts and nutrients
across the membranes, sensing of the chemical and physical environment of the cell,
communication between cells, cell adhesion and energy conversion. MPs play a role in every
physiological and infectious disease and 60% of all FDA approved drug molecules target them.
To understand how exactly these proteins function, what role they play in different diseases, or to
simulate in a computer how new potential drugs would interact with MPs, the exact molecular
structures of the MPs need to be discovered first. As MPs are naturally embedded in lipid
membranes, they are not soluble in water and it is therefore much more challenging to solve their
molecular structures compared water-soluble proteins. Consequently, the molecular structures of
less than 100 out of ~8,000 human MPs are known.
This proposal will provide new DNA-based tools that will overcome many of these challenges for
MP structure determination. For this, DNA molecules without a genetic function are chemically
synthesized and self-assembled into ring-shaped DNA nanostructures. These rings can then be
filled with lipids and MPs, thus making MPs soluble in water. Moreover, these DNA-lipid nanodiscs
provide a native cell-membrane-like environment for the MP, which is important to keep MPs in
their native physiological state. By taking advantage of the programmable nature of chemical DNA
synthesis, and self-assembly, the size, chemical and physical properties of these nanodiscs can
be controlled with a precision and ease that alternative technologies do not provide. This will be
particularly useful for solving the structures of small MPs or mechanosensitive MPs, which are
actuated by molecular forces and stress in cell membranes.
It is expected that the DNA-based molecular tools from this research will overcome current
obstacles for MP structure determination and provide functionalities that current molecular tools
cannot offer. This research will therefore enable discoveries in structural biology, pharmacology
and virology, and thereby enhance the understanding and treatment of MP-associated diseases."

Nanoparticle-based technologies including theranostic nanomedicine are fast developing areas of biomedical
research offering unprecedented potential for cancer treatment. This application is designed to bring this
potential to translational level and investigate the application of our novel image-capable nanodrug for treatment
of metastatic breast cancer in a large animal model. Breast cancer metastasis is the main cause of mortality
among breast cancer patients, and for that reason the specific aims of this application respond to an unmet
clinical need. This proposed strategy is based on our discovery that the survival of metastatic cells crucially
depends on the high expression of microRNA-10b (miR-10b) and that miR-10b is responsible for metastatic cell
viability. With this discovery it became possible to kill these cells at metastatic sites by inhibiting miR-10b. This
is achieved using a nanodrug composed of anti-miR-10b antagomirs conjugated to dextran-coated magnetic
nanoparticles (termed MN-anti-miR10b). These nanoparticles serve as delivery vehicles for the antagomirs. Also,
the magnetic properties of these nanoparticles allow for monitoring of their delivery in vivo using magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), which is an added value for clinical implementation of this therapeutic approach. In
pre-clinical studies in mice, we showed delivery of MN-anti-miR-10b to established metastases in the lymph
nodes, lungs, bone and brain. Pilot studies in companion cats showed the delivery of the nanodrug to the
metastatic lesions after intravenous injection. Therapeutic studies in the murine model of human MDA-MB-231
TNBC showed that delivery of MN-anti-miR10b to lymph nodes with established metastases resulted in arrest of
metastatic growth by halting tumor cell proliferation and triggering apoptosis. When combined with a low-dose
chemotherapy, MN-anti-miR10b caused complete elimination of lymph node metastases with no evidence of
systemic toxicity after just four weekly treatments. Next, we showed the utility of the nanodrug in combination
with low-dose chemotherapy for treatment of established lung metastases corresponding to Stage IV of human
disease in immunocompetent murine model (4T1). We found that six weekly treatments were sufficient to cause
complete regression of pre-existing lung metastases with no further dissemination to other organs in the
remaining animals.
With an outlook to clinical translation of our studies, in this application we propose to test our nanodrug strategy
in large animals with spontaneous metastatic breast cancer (companion cats). Studies proposed here will serve
as a necessary step towards first-in-human trials, because they will prove successful delivery of the nanodrug in
large animals, which are anatomically and physiologically distinct from the murine models tested to date.
Furthermore, these studies will provide us with additional information on PK/PD parameters in a large animal
model. Finally, therapeutic studies in spontaneous models will mimic those in humans where development of
metastases is largely unpredicted in terms of time and location. We expect that these studies will serve as the
final step in the pre-clinical stage of this project, which will next move to the pre-IND stage."
10853086,"Project Summary: This proposal evaluates how intracellular signaling pathways generated by the cytoplasmic innate
immune receptor NLRP3 are regulated in renal tubular epithelial cells. Renal tubule epithelial cells play a central role in
ischemic kidney injury, and our lab and others have shown that global NLRP3 blockade can prevent experimental renal
ischemia/reperfusion injury. NLRP3 signaling classically results in cell death (pyroptosis), however alternative NLRP3
signaling pathways have recently been identified that lead to secretion of IL1b/IL18 without cell death. Thus, selectively
targeting NLRP3-mediated cell death signaling might prevent renal tubule injury while still preserving the host’s ability to
secrete IL1b/IL18 and mount needed host defense responses (e.g., antimicrobial responses). The project is highly
significant for the development of targeted therapeutics for ischemic kidney injury, which occurs frequently in hospitalized
patients and in all organs procured for transplantation.
Broad/long-term objectives: The long-term goals of the proposed research are to define how NLRP3 contributes to
injurious tissue responses in the kidney and how its signaling can be effectively and selectively targeted.
Specific Aims: The specific objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that the cytoplasmic pattern recognition
receptor NLRP3 can be specifically targeted in renal tubular epithelial cells to selectively block NLRP3-mediated renal
tubule cell death, while preserving IL1b/IL18 responses. Aim 1 defines the mechanisms that drive NLRP3 signaling
pathways in proximal renal tubule cells. Aim 2 determines how NLRP3 signaling can be selectively targeted in the
proximal renal tubule cells. Aim 3 determines how NLRP3 signaling, and its selective blockade, influences renal
tubular injury/IL1b/IL18 secretion in vivo, when NLRP3 expression is isolated to the renal tubule epithelium.
Research Design and Methods for Achieving the Stated Goals: Aim 1 compares and contrasts activation of NLRP3
in human and murine proximal renal tubular cells and will determine how NLRP3 activation contributes to pyroptosis
and/or production of IL1b/IL18. Aim 2 will determine how specific NLRP3 activation pathways can be targeted in
the two species to prevent cell death and preserve cytokine secretion. Aim 3 will focus on understanding how NLRP3
restricted to the renal tubule epithelium in vivo can be targeted to prevent renal tubular injury without impairing IL1b/IL18.
In the third aim, two different models of NLRP3 expression will be used; one where the renal tubules express a conditional
loss-of-function of NLRP3 and another where there is a hyper-activatable form of NLRP3. The studies here will determine
whether canonical NLRP3-mediated cell death signaling can be uncoupled from noncanonical signaling to prevent cell
death while preserving secretion of IL1b/IL18.
Health Relatedness of Project: If the aims of this proposal are met, we will learn how activation of NLRP3 (deemed a
central cellular stress detector) can be regulated to target a common disease, renal ischemia/reperfusion injury. This
knowledge is crucial for the development of rational targeted therapies for prevention or amelioration of renal
ischemia/reperfusion injury in clinical situations where hypoxia is anticipated."

Diabetes is among the fastest growing health challenges of the 21st century, affecting >30 million people, with
≥80,000 deaths annually, and involving ~15% of U.S. national health expenditures. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is
the most common form of diabetes, which is linked to an insufficient amount of circulating insulin because of
the body’s insensitivity to the hormone. Maintenance of the insulin storage pool requires synthesis of ~6000
proinsulin (PI) molecules/ß-cell/second, each delivered to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for folding. Even
more molecules are needed in states of insulin resistance. Significantly, we discovered that PI enters aberrant
disulfide-linked intermolecular complexes, even in healthy (human and murine) islets. Under conditions that
demand increased insulin production (even prediabetes), these complexes dramatically increase, thus limiting
insulin production. We show new key evidence that these aberrantly folded PI complexes can be resolved to
monomeric PI within the ER. We recently elucidated the first map of the human PI interactome identifying PI
folding modifiers. The most significant PI interactor in human islets is the ER chaperone BiP and we present
new evidence (both gain of function, and loss of function) that this interaction, supported by BiP co-
chaperones, is absolutely required for productive proinsulin folding (and limiting misfolding), leading to
successful anterograde transport. For our studies we generated a novel BiP-tagged mouse that can for the
first time identify fundamental steps in PI folding essential for insulin production. Moreover, we show that
increased expression of BiP and its co-chaperone P58IPK dramatically reduces accumulation of the high
molecular weight PI complexes. Thus, our discoveries open the possibility that pharmacologic intervention may
improve chaperone-dependent PI folding, and this may attenuate T2D. As we begin to elucidate the human PI
folding pathway, we are developing parallel animal models to determine how PI folds/misfolds. Here we
propose to: 1) Mechanistically dissect how BiP and additional PI interactors in the ER orchestrate successful PI
folding and determine which step(s) of PI folding go awry in T2D; 2) Identify how the PI interactome changes
in human T2D; determine the function of altered PI interactions in islets from patients with T2D; and utilize
novel assays to measure productive PI folding/trafficking in ß-cells. We will integrate physiologic studies of
human islets with novel genetic and biochemical approaches to generate a comprehensive understanding of
how PI folding homeostasis impacts ß-cell function in health and disease. We believe that this hypothesis is a
high-impact idea essential to the mission of the NIDDK, and we now bring tools, assays, and approaches that
are not currently available anywhere else."

Neisseria gonorrhoeae is the sole causative agent of the sexually transmitted infection gonorrhea that
only lives in the human population. N. gonorrhoeae has co-evolved with its human host throughout
modern history and has evolved specific mechanisms of pathogenesis that relate to its mode of
transmission and the anatomical sites it colonizes. Rates of gonorrhea are rising along with the rapid
acquisition of antibiotic resistance. There is an urgent need to understand the mechanisms of N.
gonorrhoeae pathogenesis to develop new treatment options or vaccine candidates. N. gonorrhoeae
is naturally competent for DNA transformation and is one of a few bacterial species that does not
regulate competence. This grant will use CRISPR interference technology (CRISPRi) to determine
the essential genes of N. gonorrhoeae and provide the research community with the ability to regulate
the essential genes. This work will complement our funded R24 resource grant, which creates
insertional mutants of every open reading frame of N. gonorrhoeae but cannot mutate essential
genes. The R24 project is leveraging the transformation competence of N. gonorrhoeae and synthetic
DNA constructs to create ordered gene knockout libraries of the two most used N. gonorrhoeae
strains, MS11 and FA1090. These strains represent different phylogenetic clades of the bacterium.
With this conditional mutant library of CRISPRi, researchers can interrogate the entire N.
gonorrhoeae gene content to advance fundamental research and vaccine or antimicrobial

The recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies enable cost-effective characterization of the
immune system and provide novel opportunities to study adaptive immune receptor repertoire (AIRR) at the
population scale. In particular, AIRR analysis provides essential insight into the complexity of the immune system
across a large variety of human diseases, including infectious diseases, cancer, autoimmune conditions, and
neurodegenerative diseases. A commonly used assay-based approach (i.e. AIRR-Seq) provides a detailed view
of the adaptive immune system by leveraging the deep sequencing of amplified DNA or RNA from the variable
region of the T and B cell receptors (TCR and BCR) loci. However, the limited number of samples probed by the
AIRR-Seq approach restricts the ability to detect novel population-specific V(D)J gene alleles across ethnically
diverse and admixed populations. Non-targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) (e.g. WGS) promises to fill
the existing data gap by providing hundreds of thousands of NGS datasets across various ancestry groups.
However, reliable and scalable bioinformatics algorithms have yet to be developed to utilize non-targeted NGS
technologies to assemble novel population-specific alleles that would support effect-size heterogeneity across
ancestries. There's a lack of comprehensive population-specific allelic immunogenomics reference databases.
This void exacerbates existing health disparities, as discoveries in medical immunogenomics continue to be a
privilege and benefit for populations of European ancestry. The current state-of-the-art databases were built on
the genetic architecture based on individuals of European ancestry and thus fail to capture allelic variation across
diverse populations. Ongoing initiatives by the Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire Community (AIRR-C) to
improve the representation of diverse populations in reference databases (e.g. OGRDB and VDJbase) ignore
individuals of non-European ancestry and only incorporate an extremely small number of individuals of European
descent. We propose to utilize a data science approach for studying the variation of the human adaptive immune
system at a truly global scale, improving studies of immunological health and diseases, and reducing health
disparities. In this study, we will develop robust and scalable bioinformatics tools and databases able to leverage
the largest datasets covering individuals of various ancestries composed of over half a million NGS samples
spanning the AIRR-Seq, RNA-Seq, and WGS technologies. We will perform rigorous benchmarking of the
developed bioinformatics methods based on both simulated and real data to demonstrate the feasibility of using
NGS-based approaches to assemble novel V(D)J alleles. The availability of large and ethnically diverse sets of
samples will allow us to discover novel population-specific V(D)J alleles, which will enrich existing
immunogenomics databases with population-specific immune alleles. To promote the dissemination of the
obtained results, the novel alleles and assembled receptor sequences will be shared as an easy-to-use database
with a rich set of functionalities."

Malaria parasites require pantothenate (Pan) from both the insect and mammalian hosts to synthesize
coenzyme A (CoA) and acetyl-CoA (AC). Further, mosquito-stage parasites cannot take up preformed CoA
from the insect host, so they are entirely dependent on mosquito Pan availability. Thus, we hypothesize that
reducing Pan stores in the mosquito by increasing Pan kinase (PanK) activity and, in turn, CoA biosynthesis
will limit parasite survival in the mosquito, without impacting the availability of CoA/AC to the mosquito itself.
PanK is the rate-limiting enzyme in the CoA biosynthesis pathway and a logical target for our approach. In this
study we will focus on increasing PanK activity in the mosquito to convert Pan into CoA and starve the malaria
parasite of this essential precursor. To accomplish this we will utilize PanK-targeted small molecules or
pantazines and genetic manipulation of PanK in our study host Anopheles stephensi. We will screen
pantazines from a library of compounds developed by our collaborators at St. Jude Children’s Hospital. In
Aim 1, we will use a Go-No Go strategy for pantazine screening that culminates in testing the capacity of
selected pantazines to reduce P. falciparum and Plasmodium yoelii infections in A. stephensi. Aim 2 will
validate the bioactivity and specificity of candidate pantazines identified in the screen in Aim 1. The specificity
of candidate pantazines to activate PanK will be assessed through RNAi or CRISPR/Cas9 knockdown of
PanK, followed by a characterization of the impact on Pan, CoA, AC and parasite infection success.
Concurrent with Aims 1 and 2, we will generate transgenic A. stephensi with increased PanK activity and
determine the impact on Pan levels and parasite survival in Aim 3. The generation of transgenic mosquitoes
with increased midgut PanK expression will contribute to our assessment of PanK-dependent depletion of Pan
stores on parasite infection as well as other aspects of mosquito biology related to vectorial capacity.
Specifically, we will define the effects of mosquito PanK activation, via both pantazine treatment and molecular
manipulations, on A. stephensi lifespan, stress responses, metabolism and reproduction. These studies will
reveal important new insights into nutrient-driven mosquito-parasite interactions that drive parasite infection
success and they will support future efforts to optimize pantazines and novel transgenic lines as distinct
strategies for mosquito-targeted malaria control."
10817094,"Project Summary/Abstract: Parathyroid glands (PGs) are often difficult to locate intraoperatively due to their
small size and poor contrast under the surgical light. Recently, surgeons have been using near-infrared (NIR)
autofluorescence as a means to help identify PGs, however, there are false positives and negatives with this
technology and room for improvement in sensitivity and specificity. There is an unmet need to develop a reliable,
bright NIR probe that can be utilized to 1) identify and preserve normal PGs during thyroid surgery, thus reducing
postoperative hypocalcemia complications and 2) identify parathyroid adenomas during parathyroidectomy for
patients with hyperparathyroidism. Therefore, an intraoperative imaging method to help surgeons find PGs in
real-time while preserving normal tissue represents an unmet clinical need, with no available contrast agents.
 Our hypothesis guiding this study is that halogenated NIR fluorophores provide sensitive, specific, and real-
time image-guidance for improved therapeutic interventions, including noninvasive localization and
intraoperative image-guided parathyroidectomy. Under the previous NIH funding #R01EB011523, we have
developed over 850 novel NIR fluorophores tailored to endocrine imaging (endocrine-specific NIR fluorophores;
ESNFs) and successfully targeted thyroid/parathyroid glands (TG/PG), pituitary glands, thymus, adrenal glands,
pancreas, and their tumors. Sharing structural and chemical similarities with naturally occurring hormones and
drugs, ESNFs could provide high contrast on endocrine glands for image-guided surgery after a single
intravenous injection into mice, rats, and pigs (see Preliminary Data).
 Under the current NIH/NIBIB funding (#R01EB022230; Image-guided drug delivery for neuroendocrine
pancreatic tumor), we have successfully developed a series of oxazine derivatives for targeting pancreas and
pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Interestingly, many of these agents show specific uptake in other endocrine
glands including PGs. Therefore, in this renewal application, Therefore, in this renewal application, we aim to
investigate the targeting mechanism of these fluorophores along with their pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics
and safety studies. Using the “Structure-Inherent Targeting” strategy, our goal is to increase the specific affinity
of targeted fluorophores while minimizing nonspecific uptake in the thyroid, lymph nodes, or fatty tissues of the
neck, with no overt off-target adverse effects. Specific Aims are focused on three key areas: 1) systematic
optimization of the final formulation with preparative scale-up synthesis, 2) molecular target identification and
pre-operative imaging of primary hyperparathyroidism in tumor mice, and 3) evaluation of the targeted contrast
agents for intraoperative image-guided tumor surgery. We propose to intensify clinical translation activities during
the second award period, including scale-up chemistry and two species toxicity evaluations."

Despite treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 30-40% of patients diagnosed with early-stage triple-
negative breast cancer (TNBC) develop metastasis and die of their cancer. Part of standard treatment for TNBC
includes anthracycline-cyclophosphamide and taxane-based (AC-T) chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery.
Combination chemotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) that target T-cell inhibitory receptors are now
FDA-approved for early stage and metastatic TNBC. Despite promising trial results, most patients with metastatic
TNBC do not experience durable long-lasting benefits, particularly those whose tumors progressed on prior
chemotherapy. Although proliferating cancer cells are the intended targets, systemic chemotherapy clearly
impacts other organ systems. This includes detrimental effects on the immune system, such as elimination of
cytotoxic T cells. Thus, if chemotherapy impairs anti-tumor immune cells, it would limit ICI efficacy. A major
challenge to the field is that we do not understand how chemotherapy impacts immune function or tumor cell
fitness in metastatic microenvironments. In our TNBC mouse models, AC-T chemotherapy reduced primary
tumor growth and lung metastasis. Surprisingly, liver metastasis, which is a predominant metastatic site in TNBC
patients, was significantly enhanced in the AC-T-treated mice. We also observed markers of immunosuppression
in the liver after chemotherapy in both our mouse models and clinical samples. We hypothesize that the liver is
specifically immunosuppressed by chemotherapy, thus making the liver more hospitable for TNBC metastasis
and reducing ICI efficacy. Our objective is to understand how chemotherapy impacts the liver immune
microenvironment and TNBC liver metastasis, and to identify pre-clinical strategies that prevent liver
immunosuppression and metastasis.
We will use our TNBC lung metastasis models and our highly sensitive molecular barcoding method for
metastasis detection. We will identify tumor cell clones that grow in metastatic sites and if the clonal composition
changes in response to chemotherapy treatment. We will also determine whether those clones are inherently
sensitive/resistant to chemotherapy or if their response to chemotherapy relies on the metastatic
microenvironment. We will perform high dimensional immune-profiling of primary tumors and liver from
chemotherapy-treated tumor-free and tumor-bearing mice using single cell multi-omic approaches. We will
assess immune function of cells derived from metastatic sites in the mouse models. We will validate our findings
by multiplex immunofluorescence staining on patient biopsy samples taken from metastatic sites. We will identify
treatment regimens that target tumor cells while protecting anti-tumor immune cells. Our proposed studies will
deepen our understanding of the systemic effects of chemotherapy, not only on breast cancer cells that spread
to various organs but also on immune cells in those organs. Success in our line of investigation will identify new
treatment approaches that are effective against breast cancer but do not diminish critical immune cells."
10812460,"Project Summary
CRISPR-Cas systems provide bacteria and archaea with adaptive immunity against their viruses (phages).
The hallmark of the CRISPR-Cas immune response is the acquisition of a “memory” of infection in the form of
a short DNA sequence from the invading phage genome. This sequence, known as “spacer”, is integrated into
the CRISPR locus of the host and then transcribed and processed into a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) guide.
CRISPR-associated (Cas) effectors use the crRNA to recognize the nucleic acids of the invading phage
through base-pair complementarity and trigger different defense strategies. For Type III CRISPR systems,
commonly present in the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, target recognition leads to the dormancy of
the infected cell, an event that prevents viral replication and propagation. Here, we propose to investigate a
central, yet unanswered, question about this mechanism: if there are spacers that trigger a growth arrest in the
host, how are they maintained in the bacterial community after they are acquired? Our central hypothesis is
that the degradation of the phage DNA eventually eliminates the viral genome from the host, enabling growth
and the fixation of the spacer in the population. To investigate this, we will explore several aspects of the
Csm6-mediated response required for the defense mediated by type III CRISPR spacers that match late-
expressed viral genes. First, we will define whether dormant cells eventually die or are able to exit this state,
survive infection and continue growing. Second, we will determine whether spacers that match late-expressed
phage genes can provide a selective advantage to the cell that harbors them, even when they trigger host
dormancy. Third, we will determine if these spacers are actually acquired during infection. In all these
experiments we will test our central hypothesis by using mutant staphylococci lacking in the expression of
several nucleases to determine if they are required for the fixation of dormancy-triggering spacers. Finally, we
will use a transposon library of mutants to investigate, in an unbiased manner, the impact of host genes that
could be involved in the exit from dormancy.
Our proposed experiments, aimed at understanding how spacers from dormancy-inducing CRISPR systems
are fixed in the host population, will fill in a fundamental knowledge gap in our understanding of the hallmark
feature of CRISPR immunity: the generation of a memory of infection. In addition, by directly addressing a
fundamental mechanism of phage defense of staphylococci, our proposal can facilitate the success of phage
therapies for the treatment of staphylococcal disease. In a more indirect manner, the characterization of the
molecular mechanisms of type III CRISPR systems can lead to avenues to repurpose these immune systems
for gene editing, particularly for the development of gene therapies to treat genetic diseases."
10837747,"Project Summary: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined as an abrupt loss of kidney function and is very common in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD). AKI is associated with high mortality rates in children and is thought to be a risk factor for a permanent loss of kidney function and development of end stage kidney disease. These elevated risks require urgent focus on AKI in children with CKD to better characterize the modifiable risk factors of AKI as well as understand the relationship between AKI and kidney health. Improving the understanding of the risk factors and pathogenesis of AKI will provide a basis for interventional studies to prevent AKI, limit progression of CKD, and improve long-term outcomes. 
To study AKI in children with CKD and address a substantial gap in pediatric research, we have developed research studies with the 1100 participants of the CKD in Children (CKiD) cohort, the largest cohort of children with CKD. The yearly study visits with kidney function, blood pressure, and albuminuria measurements for all CKiD participants minimizes the bias and confounding of previous research which retrospectively examined kidney function assessments performed only when clinically indicated. As the kidney tubules are critical to life and essential to supporting multiple critical functions in a growing child, we will conduct a global assessment of kidney health using biomarkers of both glomerular and tubular health. To characterize tubular health including tubular regeneration, injury, dysfunction, and inflammation before and after AKI, we will measure 4 urine biomarkers (epidermal growth factor, kidney injury molecule-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, α-1 microglobulin). They will add substantially to the examination of key pathways that may contribute to CKD progression after AKI. In preliminary data, we observed that after multivariable adjustment, each of these tubular biomarkers is associated with a subsequent decline in kidney function. We also observed at two CKiD sites, that 25 of 83 children (30%) developed at least one episode of AKI and that those with AKI were more than twice as likely to develop CKD progression. The specific aims are: 1) Determine the relationship between characteristics of glomerular and tubular health with the risk of AKI; 2) Determine the association between AKI with the subsequent change of GFR, blood pressure, albuminuria, growth, and tubular health biomarkers; 3) Develop and validate a risk prediction model for future progression of CKD in children combining CKD risk factors, prior AKI characteristics, and biomarkers of tubule health. Our research will represent a foundational epidemiologic study of AKI and may better explain the highly variable long-term outcomes in children with CKD. Completion of our research will provide new insights to identify therapeutic targets and support future interventional studies of AKI in CKD. Furthermore, a validated risk prediction model and understanding of the relationship between AKI and long-term outcomes may provide for the early detection and prompt treatment of GFR decline after AKI."
10910015,"Plasmodium parasites are responsible for hundreds of millions of malaria cases annually. During the asexual
stages of development in red blood cells, malaria parasites acquire certain nutrients from human serum while
retaining the ability to synthesize others. We are studying an essential enzyme cofactor called lipoate and its
metabolism in Plasmodium falciparum. Our studies demonstrate that erythrocytic stage parasites are
auxotrophic for lipoate, even though they contain a metabolic pathway to synthesize this cofactor. Proteins in
the apicoplast organelle rely on lipoate synthesis while proteins in the parasite mitochondrion rely on
scavenging and cannot obtain lipoate synthesized in the apicoplast. The proposed studies are focused on two
aspects of lipoate scavenging and employ a combination of biochemical, cell biology and genetic approaches.
Our first aim is to define the essentail roles of lipoate-dependent proteins and identify the factors required to
support these activities in the parasite mitochondrion. Our second aim will probe the mechanism of lipoate
uptake and attachment to mitochondrial proteins in order to understand how, when and why this process is
gated by redox potential. These studies will forge a detailed link between the lipoate attachment enzymes and
their protein substrates. By virtue of relying on a host nutrient, these proteins represent a vulnerable aspect of
parasite biology which could be targeted at several levels."
10861822,"Project Abstract
Copy number variants (CNVs) are associated with greatly elevated rates of neurodevelopmental
psychiatric disorders (NPDs). Efforts to date have focused on a handful of the most frequent recurrent
CNVs. As a result, the guiding principles underlying relationships between CNV-related variations in
brain architecture and the function of genes encompassed in these CNVs are unknown. In addition, the
behavioral features mediated by CNV-related brain variations, and their convergence with findings in
idiopathic NPDs, are poorly understood. To address these questions, we propose to utilize existing
cohorts to assemble the largest neuroimaging genomic dataset to date (n~140,000). The final
aggregated dataset will include ~29,000 carriers of CNVs ≥ 50kb, encompassing coding genes. CNVs
will be identified using the same pipeline across all datasets. Multimodal neuroimaging data, including
T1-weighted structural images, T1w/T2w ratio images, resting-state functional MRI, and diffusion MRI,
will be processed using the same harmonized pipelines. Our team, with expertise in medical and
statistical genetics, mathematical modeling, and brain imaging, will work collaboratively across 4 sites
in the USA, Canada, and Norway to address the following Specific Aims:
 Aim 1: Characterize the effect of the most frequent and well-established recurrent NPD-
associated CNVs on brain structure and function. We will also investigate if common variants
(polygenic scores) modulate the effects of NPD-CNVs on neuroimaging-derived measures.
 Aim 2: Investigate effects on brain structure and function of global CNV burden using CNV-
risk scores. A method to link functional annotations of genes to CNV-associated neuroimaging
alterations. The vast majority of clinically relevant CNVs are too rare to be studied individually. Using
CNV-risk scores based on gene annotations, we will investigate (in aggregate) the effects on brain
architecture of all rare CNVs (n~29,000) containing coding genes.
 Aim 3: Linking CNV-associated neuroimaging signatures to RDoC domains and psychiatric
phenotypes. We will test the relationship between CNV-neuroimaging signatures identified above and
dimensional measures of cognition and psychopathology in large, deeply phenotyped, unselected
population cohorts.
 This worldwide CNV neuroimaging initiative will boost power to identify mechanisms that
mediate the effects of deletions and duplications on brain architecture. This concerted endeavor will
advance our understanding of mechanisms by which genetic variants increase vulnerability for NPDs
such as autism and schizophrenia."
10764315,"Diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) are multi-domain lipid kinases that catalyze phosphorylation of diacylglycerol
(DAG) to generate phosphatidic acid (PA). Both DAG and PA serve as potent lipid messengers to shape cellular
responses by altering subcellular localization, activation, and function of essential receptor proteins (ranging
from enzymes to transcription factors). DAG and PA also serve as building blocks for phospholipid and
triglyceride biosynthesis and integral to membrane architecture and bioenergetics. The significance of our
proposed studies is the enormous therapeutic potential of targeting individual DGKs because of their
fundamental role in sculpting the lipidome to support metabolic, structural, and signaling demands of healthy and
diseased cells. Despite their clinical value and discovery nearly 30 years ago, gaps in knowledge with regards
to ligand binding and regulation of DGK active-sites in living systems have confounded basic understanding of
how 10 mammalian DGK isoforms, which share a common catalytic domain, are capable of regulating distinct
metabolic and signaling functions. We will test our hypothesis that C1 and other non-catalytic domains, which
largely differentiate DGK isoforms, function in substrate and inhibitor recognition of DGK active sites.
 The proposed research program will test whether selective blockade of DGK can restore deficient DAG
signaling to overcome immunosuppression of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte activity. Genetic and clinical evidence
point to DGKs as promising targets for reversing immunosuppression of T cells although the molecular
mechanisms coupling disrupted DGK metabolism to enhanced TCR signaling are not clear. Our mechanistic
studies will establish a testable model for fundamental understanding of substrate and inhibitor recognition in
DGK active sites to guide development of new chemical strategies to perturb activity of T cell specific DGKs in
vivo for immunotherapy applications. Our long-term goals for this proposal are to functionally map novel and
druggable small molecule binding sites on DGK and potentially other DGK isoforms in T cells to: 1) gain
molecular level insights into DAG fatty acyl chain recognition and specificity, 2) identify molecular features of
enzyme active sites to target lipid versus protein kinases, and 3) develop new inhibitors for selective inactivation
of DGK isoforms in live cells and animals.
 We will test 2 independent yet related specific aims directed at: (Aim 1) identification of the DAG binding
site, (Aim 1) understanding how individual DGK domains couple extracellular signals to shape T cell responses,
(Aim 2) determining how DGK inhibitors amplify T cell activation, (Aim 2) understanding how DGK inhibitors
reverse T cell immunosuppression in vivo, and (Aim 2) determining if DGK inhibitors affect membrane
translocation. The overall impact of our findings will be to understand how intrinsic features of DGKs cross-talk
with extrinsic features of cellular environments to form the basis of a lipid signaling code that can be
therapeutically targeted for reversing immunosuppression of T cells."

RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play key roles in regulating gene expression and many cellular functions. A lot of
RBPs are aggregation-prone due to their low complexity, prion-like domains. While naturally-occurring
aggregation of RBPs is important for the compartmentalized control of RNA metabolism, aberrant aggregation
is detrimental and is associated with many diseases, in particular, age-related diseases such as
neurodegenerative diseases and cancers. However, a systematic analysis of RBP aggregation and its functional
consequences during aging remains lacking. Here we propose to conduct a systems biology analysis of age-
dependent RBP aggregation using the replicative aging of S.cerevisiae as a model system. Our initial screen
has identified positive RBP candidates that aggregate upon aging-related perturbations. Building upon these
findings, we will combine innovative microfluidics with single-cell imaging technologies to systematically
characterize these RBP aggregates during aging and to evaluate how these aggregates influence gene
expression, aging phenotypes and the lifespan of individual living cells. In Aim 1, we will systematically
characterize each of the identified RBPs that aggregate during aging. We will determine the biophysical and
biochemical properties, material state and phase transition of RBP aggregates at different stages of the lifespan,
which will provide important clues about how these aggregates influence cell physiology during aging. In Aim 2,
we will investigate the interplay between RBP aggregation and cellular aging, focusing on how aggregation of
RBPs is regulated by conserved aging-related pathways or factors, and how these aggregates contribute to age-
dependent cellular changes and the final lifespan. In Aim 3, we will evaluate how RBP aggregation contributes
to the proteomic changes during aging. We will use a newly-developed high-throughput microfluidic platform to
identify target genes that are regulated by RBP aggregation and will examine their influences on aging,
establishing the functional links among RBP aggregation, proteomic changes and aging phenotypes. Finally, we
will integrate all the data generated in Aims 1, 2 and 3, delineate a systems-level regulatory network of RBP
aggregation during yeast replicative aging, and develop a dedicated website for sharing the data to the scientific
community. The RBP-regulated network will provide mechanistic insights into the causes, control and
consequences of pathological RBP aggregation in aging and will be used to guide the design of new hypotheses
and experiments, laying the foundation for the development of therapeutic and preventive strategies towards
age-associated diseases."

This proposal is a competitive renewal of a multiple-PI R01 funded through NIAAA. The goal of the application
is to examine how ethanol (EtOH) exposure contributes to fat accumulation in the liver due to altered dynamic
properties of the lipid droplet (LD), a fat storage organelle. Almost all heavy drinkers develop fatty liver, which
is marked by the aberrant and significant accumulation of intrahepatocellular triglycerides stored within LDs.
Understanding the cellular processes contributing to this fat accumulation will provide essential information for
preventing further injury progression, as it is known that alcoholic fatty liver is the initial but reversible stage of
liver injury. Here, we propose to provide molecular insights into these critical questions, aimed at
potential treatments that reverse or prevent EtOH-induced steatosis. This proposal combines the expertise of
two senior investigators recognized for their contributions to the study of EtOH-induced cell injury
and hepatic LD biology. We believe this collaborative effort has been beneficial to the field of ALD and will result
in outcomes not attainable by individual efforts alone. This proposal comprises two well-integrated aims. Aim
One: Blockage of ER-Associated Lipophagy by EtOH. We have made the interesting observation that
nascent LDs of a conserved size (170nm) accumulate at the ER surface of EtOH-damaged hepatocytes and
that lysosomal/autophagic compartments subsequently catabolize these ER-associated LDs. Notably, both
chronic EtOH exposure and pharmacologic disruption of lysosome function attenuate this process leading to
hepatocyte steatosis. Aim Two: Disruptive Alterations of the LD Proteome by EtOH. We found that many
components of the LD “surface proteome” are post-translationally modified by ubiquitin, a pathway we posit
directs removal of select proteins to the proteasome for degradation or directs the entire LD to the lysosome for
catabolism. Importantly, we have found that chronic EtOH exposure markedly increases the ubiquitination of the
LD proteome and thus disrupts normal LD degradation/catabolism leading to steatosis. These observations and
specific aims will allow us to pursue the CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS of this study that EtOH promotes
accumulation of both mature and nascent, ER-associated, LDs through alterations of the LD proteome inhibiting
lipophagy and lipid catabolism leading to hepatocyte steatosis. The proposed investigation will utilize state-of-
the-art imaging and proteomic technologies to quantify specific molecular events that contribute to alcohol-
induced fatty liver. Successful completion of these studies will provide novel insights as to how EtOH affects LD
dynamics in liver cells and important information for therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing or eliminating the
severity of steatosis and blocking its further progression to alcoholic steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis."

Brain development occurs at a rapid pace prenatally and throughout childhood, impacted by dynamic genetic
and environmental influences. Studies using advanced neuroimaging have provided significant insights into
brain development but have been limited by small sample size, especially for high-risk populations. Substance-
exposed infants are at particularly high risk for adverse outcomes; however, findings are inconsistent, making it
difficult to disentangle prenatal exposure effects from other adverse influences. The objectives of our HEALthy
Brain and Child Development (HBCD) Prenatal Experiences and Longitudinal Development (PRELUDE)
consortium are to characterize typical trajectories of brain development from birth through childhood,
measuring the influence of key biologic and environmental factors and their interactions on child social,
cognitive, and emotional development. We will assess how children prenatally exposed to opioids and other
substances, as well as environmental adversity, differ in those brain trajectories and outcomes. Our consortium
consists of six centers (Arkansas Children’s Research Institute, Case Western Reserve University, Cincinnati
Children’s Hospital, Children’s National Medical Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and
Vanderbilt University) which have collaborated previously and have complementary expertise in neuroimaging,
neurophysiology, longitudinal clinical research, child development, substance exposure and addiction,
ethical/legal issues, and clinical care of high-risk infants/children. The PRELUDE consortium will recruit 680
pregnant women with substance use, 680 at-risk pregnant women without substance use, and 1360
comparison pregnant women representative of the general population to contribute to the overall HBCD study.
We will work closely with the other sites, the HBCD Consortium Administrative Core, and the HBCD Data
Coordinating Center to develop a comprehensive study protocol and ensure compliance of study workflow and
data transfer. Our consortium has an optimized research protocol and 4 specific aims: 1) Employ ethical and
evidence-based best practices to enroll and retain a diverse cohort of pregnant women into a longitudinal
study of infant/child brain development, oversampling mothers from high-risk backgrounds and those using
substances during pregnancy; 2) Engage a comprehensive array of maternal- and child-oriented community
stakeholders to identify community concerns and priorities regarding this research, minimize risks, and
promote long-term engagement of the recruited child-mother dyads; 3) Collect rich data to examine how
maternal health context and broader environmental factors may affect the maternal-fetal dyad and
neurodevelopment of children; 4) Capture key developmental windows during which maternal and
environmental factors may interact with brain and behavioral development of children. The insights from
these data will provide greater understanding of factors affecting early childhood brain development,
allowing targeted interventions and improved outcomes for mother-child dyads."

Neurodevelopmental processes are shaped by dynamic interactions between genes and environments.
Maladaptive experiences early in life can alter developmental trajectories, leading to harmful and enduring
developmental sequelae. Pre- and postnatal hazards include maternal substance exposure, toxicant exposures
in pregnancy and early life, maternal health conditions, parental psychopathology, maltreatment, structural
racism, and excessive stress. To elucidate how various environmental hazards impact child development, it is
imperative that a normative template of developmental trajectories over the first 10 years of life be established
based on a sufficiently large and demographically diverse sample of the US population. To accomplish this, the
Healthy Brain and Child Development National Consortium (HBCD-NC) has been formed to deploy a
harmonized, optimized, and innovative set of neuroimaging (MRI, EEG) measures complemented by an
extensive battery of behavioral, physiological, and psychological tools, and biospecimens to understand
neurodevelopmental trajectories in a sample of 7,500 mothers and infants enrolled at 24 sites across the United
States (US). The HBCD-NC will carry out a common research protocol under direction of the HBCD-NC
Administrative Core (HCAC) and will assemble and distribute a comprehensive and well-curated research
dataset to the scientific community at large under the direction of the HBCD-NC Data Coordinating Center
(HDCC). The overarching goal of the HBCD-NC is to create a comprehensive, harmonized, and high-
dimensional dataset that will characterize typical neurodevelopmental trajectories in US children and that will
assess how biological and environmental exposures affect those trajectories. A special emphasis will be placed
on understanding the impact of pre- and postnatal exposure to opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco and/or other
substances. To address these broad objectives, the sample of women enrolled will include: 1) a racially,
ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse cohort that is representative of the US population; 2) pregnant woman
with use of targeted substances (opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco); and 3) demographically and behaviorally
similar women without substance use in pregnancy to enable valid causal inferences. In addition, the HBCD-NC
will identify key developmental windows during which both harmful and protective environments have the most
influence on later neurodevelopmental outcomes. The large, multi-modal, longitudinal, and generalizable dataset
that will be produced for the first time by this study will provide novel insights into child development using state-
of-the-art methods. The HBCD-NC study will inform public policy to improve the health and development of
children across the nation."

efficacious rehabilitation approaches for individuals with dysphagia after stroke. To achieve this career goal, Dr.
Krekeler must be able to design and execute large, multi-site clinical trials. This career development plan was
created to provide the training necessary elevate her to this level. Her mentor team includes several NIH funded
stroke and dysphagia clinical trials experts (Drs. Broderick, Vagal, Sucharew, Rogus-Pulia). Under their
guidance, Dr. Krekeler will complete the outlined career development plan to receive the specific training
necessary to succeed. This training plan and clinical trial perfectly build on her existing skill set in translational
and clinical research. Her trajectory from K01 pilot to R01 trial is strong. Her primary mentor, Dr. Broderick,
directs NIH StrokeNet and is heavily involved in the many on-going, multi-site stroke recovery trials at University
of Cincinnati and has enthusiastically welcomed Dr. Krekeler into this research consortium. The opportunities to
engage in on-going stroke recovery trials at this institution are unparalleled. These specific engagements,
outlined in the training plan, will be supplemented by formal coursework in clinical trials and neuroscience. In
addition to the excellent mentorship, research environment, and training opportunities outlined in this award, Dr.
Krekeler will also collect essential primary data regarding clinical efficacy of lingual endurance exercise to inform
the next phase of study. This pilot trial will evaluate the effect of lingual endurance exercise (vs sham exercise)
on recovery of swallow function after stroke. The Primary Aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of lingual
endurance exercise vs sham on swallow function in individuals with post-stroke dysphagia. We
hypothesize that lingual endurance training will result in greater improvement in measures of oral swallow physiology
as compared to sham. The Exploratory Aim of this work will allow for Dr. Krekeler to gain experience in MRI
sequencing and analysis and will collect preliminary data regarding changes in white matter tract diffusion
and cortical thickness in endurance vs sham exercise. We hypothesize that lingual endurance exercise will
be associated with improved integrity of white matter diffusion and increased cortical thickness in the primary
motor cortex and as compared to sham. Regardless of outcome, this dataset will provide innovative and highly
novel information regarding the relationship between lingual function, swallowing impairments, and cortical
representation of dysphagia in a post-stroke population. These pilot data will be essential in providing sufficient
power for designing an R01 Phase II intervention trial to investigate how to maximize gains with timing and
intensity of therapy delivery to better recover swallow function after stroke."
10839392,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Opioid overdose continues to take lives at an astounding rate, reaching a record high of 69,710 deaths in
2020. Medications for OUD such as buprenorphine reduce risk of opioid overdose mortality. While policy
efforts have expanded buprenorphine treatment capacity, buprenorphine remains underutilized due to poor
retention in care. Observational data from real-world settings demonstrate 180-day retention rates as low as
25-40%. Thus, the federal Overdose Prevention Strategy identifies research to improve retention as a key
priority. To this end, research examining buprenorphine dosage regimens could identify strategies to improve
retention. Data from trials and observational studies suggest that higher induction and maintenance dosage
could improve retention. Scarce literature describes current buprenorphine dosage practices, but the data we
do have suggest variable dosage practices, with many patients never achieving recommended dosage targets.
Furthermore, research has demonstrated downward trends in buprenorphine dosage levels, meaning that
underdosage may be growing. In this Mentored Research Career Development Award application, I propose to
examine the relationship between buprenorphine dosage regimens and OUD treatment retention. Specifically,
the goals of this work are to 1) describe current buprenorphine dosage practices in terms of dosage
trajectories, 2) estimate the impact of two distinct buprenorphine dosage strategies on retention, and 3)
estimate the population-level clinical and cost impact of improved buprenorphine dosage practices on retention
and overdose for the state of Massachusetts. In parallel, I have identified three training objectives: 1) develop
skills using machine learning clustering methods, 2) learn causal inference using a target trial emulation, and
3) develop simulation modeling skills. Through these training objectives, I will develop comprehensive
synergistic skills in the data sciences. The research in this proposal builds directly on my prior work using
pharmacy claims data to examine trends in buprenorphine receipt. This proposal leverages this prior
experience to investigate the role of specific buprenorphine dosage strategies on retention. I have identified a
supportive research environment and an experienced mentor team with a) content and methodologic expertise
and b) extensive track records in guiding trainees to independent research careers. The strength of these
resources will ensure that I gain the expertise necessary to succeed in completing the proposed scope of work
and achieve my long-term goal of becoming an independent physician investigator using large data to study
innovations for substance use disorder treatment. At the end of this award, I will be well-positioned to apply for
an R-level award using national Medicaid data to examine a) the impact of emerging buprenorphine dosage
strategies on retention as fentanyl adulteration penetrates the opioid supply, and b) disparities in
buprenorphine dosage by race, ethnicity and region."

I am a dually trained neuroscientist and environmental epidemiologist. My primary research interest is the
impact of early life environmental exposures on the developing brain. The goal of this proposal is to gain
training in biostatistics, epidemiology, and data science, supporting my transition into an independent
transdisciplinary researcher in the emerging field of big-data environmental developmental neuroscience. I
propose a novel application of the lagged weighted quantile sum (LWQS) regression to link temporally
resolved air pollution (particulate matter < 2.5 µm; PM2.5) with diagnostic and transdiagnostic (multi-dimensional
behavioral and neural changes) in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). I leverage rich, existent behavioral and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
phenotyping from a well-established big-data biobank, the Healthy Brain Network (HBN), along with a novel
spatiotemporal model of weekly PM2.5 exposure. I hypothesize that higher PM2.5 exposure during critical
windows of prenatal development is associated with increased ASD and ADHD diagnosis, and a
transdiagnostic approach captures the population burden of exposure. In the K99 phase, I propose to uncover
mechanistic links between prenatal ambient PM2.5 exposure and behavioral (Aim 1) and MRI (Aim 2)
phenotypes in children with ASD and ADHD. In the R00 phase, I propose to acquire longitudinal behavioral
and MRI data to examine associations between prenatal PM2.5 exposure on developmental trajectories (Aim 3).
To achieve these scientific goals, I will obtain training and mentorship from an expert mentoring team with
transdisciplinary expertise which will provide me with balanced training in both technical skills, and professional
development. Technical skills will cover: 1) high dimensional longitudinal analytic approaches with Dr. Chris
Gennings, 2) environmental developmental epidemiology with Dr. Megan Horton, and 3) processing of big-data
MRI and behavioral datasets with Dr. Mike Milham. Dr. Horton will also lead my professional development
skills training, including grant writing, project management, strategic planning to accomplish short- and long-
term goals, maintaining scientific rigor and reproducibility, and cultivating a professional network. The proposed
complementary training plan positions me to pioneer the use of big data to investigate the link between
multidimensional exposures and behavioral and neuroimaging outcomes in typically and atypically developing
children. My long-term career goal is to use big data to assess the impact of the changing climate on children’s
brain and behavioral outcomes. I will use this K99/R00 as a foundation for a future R01 grant and career as an
independent tenure-track faculty member. This application overcomes barriers in environmental developmental
neuroscience thus advancing our ability to identify mechanisms underlying associations between climate-
related environmental exposures and neurodevelopmental disorders."

This Program Project involves the active participation of researchers from 4 different institutions, each of them
located in a distinct location (University of California, Los Angeles; Pasteur Institute; The Medical College of
Wisconsin, and Duke University). The effective integration and communication of the different participants in
this initiative is critical to achieve the aims. The primary goal of the Main Administrative Core (located at UCLA)
is to facilitate communication and integrate Projects and Cores and manage administrative aspects needed for
the smooth operation of the Program. Note that there is a separate International Clinical Administrative Core
located at Duke University that is responsible for administrative aspects of international coordination, including
data and sample management. The specific objectives of the Main Administrative Core are the following: 1) To
promote integration, rapid communication and effective collaboration between the members of Projects and
Cores; 2) To support exchange of information, reagents, methodologies, expertise and data among all members
of the Program Project; 3) To implement and maintain an External Scientific Advisory Board that will be tasked
to critically evaluate the progress of the Program; and 4) To manage all administrative and compliance functions
associated with the Program Project. Integration of project and core members will be accomplished by organizing
various types of meetings to increase interaction, exchange of information, re-prioritize strategy and
communicate results through publications and reports. Four types of meetings will be implemented: 1) annual
meetings of PIs and Co-PIs with the External Scientific Advisory Board; 2) quarterly meetings of all research
personnel associated with all projects and cores to present progress through video-conference; 3) monthly
meetings through videoconference of the management team to discuss status of the Program Project, resolve
potential problems and overview the budget; and 4) bimonthly project meetings to discuss ongoing activities,
problem solving, and planning. The integration of all program project personnel will be facilitated using the
Microsoft Teams calendar, meeting, chat, and project management tools. An important task of the Administrative
Core will be to make sure the Program Project is advancing in the accomplishment of the goals and timelines
originally proposed, but also to incorporate new ideas and methodologies that may arise. This will be achieved
with the help of the Scientific Advisory Board during the annual meeting where we will review and evaluate the
scientific progress and re-prioritize effort if needed."

Bottom-up, high-throughput prototyping of extracellular vesicle mimetics using cell-free synthetic biology
Cells secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) that function as primary messengers of intercellular communication
and are studied as promising drug-delivery vehicles and therapeutics. However, the clinical application of native
EVs has been hindered by their low production yield, impurity, and inherent heterogeneity. Native EVs contain
many biologically active components, such as RNAs and proteins, spread out over numerous subpopulations.
This biological complexity is both the strength and the Achilles’ heel of native EVs. While various features of this
complexity enable the beneficial therapeutic effects of EVs, it is not clear which plays a dominant role. However,
the complex set of proteins and RNAs results in heterogeneous EVs that are challenging to study and use as a
standardized treatment. Therefore, separating out and defining the critical biomolecular features from the overall
heterogeneous set will allow us to perform quality control of EVs and to reproducibly produce or study EVs. A
major bottleneck in finding the critical molecular parts of EVs is the lack of high-throughput methods. To
overcome this difficulty, our team will create a synthetic biology-based, cell-free high-throughput discovery
platform. The platform will be able to synthesize EV mimetics using a cell-free synthesis approach (Aim 1),
coupled with high-throughput examination of EV mimetic potency in vitro (Aim 2). Select EV mimetics will also
be investigated using an in vivo model system of neuroprotection and immune modulation (Aim 3). Throughout
the study, we will use native mesenchymal stem/stromal cell EVs and neurological diseases as our model system
to evaluate the platform. Our work will enable the high-throughput study of EVs for any disease and biological
questions of interest. In addition, we will unveil new insights into EVs that address key debated topics in the EV
field."
10841713,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
To diagnose pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in its precursor or early stages, novel screening tools
must apply liquid biomarkers with localization using novel imaging strategies in high-risk populations. The OHSU
PCDC Research Unit proposes three aims highlighting its multidisciplinary strengths in cancer biology, imaging,
and implementation science. The overarching theme of the proposed research focuses on sensitivity, feasibility,
and patient acceptability. Our sensitive blood-based screening test can be applied with minimal quantities of
blood and is easily modifiable based on further discoveries. If positive, this would prompt application of a feasible,
non-contrast, and robust magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol that augments MRI and magnetic
resonance chlangiopancreatography (MRCP) of the pancreas with quantitatively rigorous MR Fingerprinting
(MRF). MRF can simultaneously quantify parameters that are associated with fibrosis and inflammation (T1, T2,
and T1p). We hypothesize that these parameters are upregulated in high-grade dysplasia (e.g., high-risk
intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) and grade 2-3 pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN))
and early-stage pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Further, quantitative MRI will reduce the high
interobserver variability of MR interpretation and requirement for time consuming and technically complex MR
protocols that can be challenging to implement outside of pancreas referral centers. If successful, MRF may
obviate the need for Gadolinium based contrast agents in screening populations undergoing frequent MRI and
MRCP. Finally, we will increase enrollment of high-risk individuals into PCDC Signature Cohorts, through
leveraging an existing large, statewide cohort, Healthy Oregon Project. Further, we will work collaboratively with
our Community Outreach, Research & Engagement team to understand and address barriers to engagement in
PDAC surveillance among members of minoritized communities, particularly those who suffer disproportionally
from PDAC. These efforts will ensure participation among underrepresented populations who are least likely to
take part in cancer screening while contributing to the consortium mission of expanding PCDC Signature
Cohorts.
 The OHSU Research Unit is prepared to meaningfully collaborate with the PCDC Consortium by sharing
existing resources from the Oregon Pancreas Tissue Registry (> 3,700 patients enrolled), OHSU PRECEDE
consortium subjects (> 100 high-risk individuals enrolled to date) and potential expansion to other PRECEDE
centers, and the OHSU High Risk Pancreatic Cancer Screening clinic (> 750 unique patients who have
completed at least one screening test). In addition, our team includes experts in implementation science who
have designed and activated the Healthy Oregon Project, an app-based platform that allows at-home acquisition
of genetic data through mail-in kits and population-based interaction to find and interact with high-risk individuals."
10815556,"Despite the VA’s considerable success in reducing the number of homeless Veterans through permanent
supportive housing, a fundamental problem remains. Permanent housing is necessary, but not sufficient, for
successful social integration. Many Veterans remain isolated and without adequate social support after being
housed. Black Veterans disproportionately experience homelessness yet remain understudied in psychological
science. A better understanding of racial differences in risk and protective factors of social integration in
recently housed Black and White Veterans could inform the development of novel rehabilitative interventions.
This Career Development Award (CDA-2) proposes to utilize an innovative, multimodal approach to examine
the contributions of stress, inflammation, and resilience to social integration in recently housed Black and
White Veterans. Homelessness is extremely stressful and Black Veterans may experience additional stressors
due to systemic inequities that could impede social integration. Furthermore, psychosocial stress is associated
with an inflammatory response in the body. Inflammation could, in turn, exacerbate problems with social
integration given the increasing evidence of its effect on social behavior. However, previous work finds better
social integration in homeless Black Veterans compared to White Veterans, suggesting the presence of
protective factors that mitigate the effects of stressors on social integration in Black Veterans. Resilience is a
modifiable trait that might help buffer the negative consequences of stress and inflammation on social
integration. The extent to which these factors differentially impact social integration in recently housed Black
and White Veterans is relatively unknown. The overall goal of this longitudinal study is to examine racial
differences in the effects of stress, inflammation, and resilience on social integration in recently housed Black
and White Veterans. First, we will examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of stress,
inflammation, and resilience with social integration. Second, we will examine whether race moderates these
associations. As an exploratory aim, we will examine an integrative longitudinal model of social integration,
including the risk and protective factors listed above and psychiatric symptoms, in recently housed Black and
White Veterans. Findings from this study have the potential to advance our understanding of risk and
protective mechanisms of social integration in recently housed Black and White Veterans and inform innovative
rehabilitative treatments that mitigate the effects of stress and inflammation to improve social integration.
This CDA will provide the applicant, Derek M. Novacek, PhD, with the training in the areas of: (1) social
integration and Veteran homelessness; (2) stress and inflammation, including multiple methods to assess
inflammatory markers; and (3) racial health disparities in Veterans. The applicant’s career goal is to become a
VA research psychologist, working to improve social integration in homeless Veterans and develop culturally
congruent interventions. The training outlined in this CDA application will lay the groundwork for the applicant
to develop an independent research program within the VA focused on determinants of social integration in
homeless Veterans. The VA RR&D Center on Enhancing Community Integration for Homeless Veterans
(THRIVe), VISN 22 Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Center (MIRECC) at the VA Greater Los
Angeles Healthcare System (GLA), and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) provide an excellent
environment and infrastructure to complete the proposed study. The primary mentor will be Michael F. Green,
PhD, the Director of THRIVe, Director of the VISN 22 MIRECC Treatment Unit, and an established researcher
in Veteran homelessness. The applicant will also receive specialized training from an expert in research with
vulnerable Veterans (Lillian Gelberg, MD, MPH), a leading researcher in inflammation (Steven W. Cole, PhD),
and a renowned scholar in racial health disparities in Veterans (Donna L. Washington, MD, MPH). The
applicant will also receive statistical consultation from biostatistician, Catherine A. Sugar, Ph.D."

Candidate: Andrew J. Read, MD, MS is a gastroenterologist and health services researcher at the University
of Michigan with a research focus on improving diagnosis of gastrointestinal (GI) tract cancers. Dr. Read has
prior training in biostatistics but not in mixed methods or implementation science. This NCI K08 award will train
him to become a leader in the translational science of medical prediction, providing him with the skills to
develop tailored implementation strategies for cancer prediction models and test these strategies in future
clinical trials.
Research Context: Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a common sign of many diseases, including GI tract
cancers. Despite this important association, IDA is often under-recognized or under-investigated, resulting in
delays in diagnosis. Fortunately, the electronic health record (EHR) contains potential diagnostic clues that can
be leveraged to improve diagnosis of GI tract cancers. Specifically, algorithms can be developed to detect
subtle changes in complete blood count (CBC) parameters to predict GI tract cancers. However, prediction
models have rarely been implemented in clinical practice. Identifying the barriers and facilitators to
implementing a model can allow for more customized implementation strategies to improve the chances of
successful implementation.
Research Aims: Dr. Read will (1) Refine a prediction model for detection of GI tract cancers using longitudinal
laboratory data from the Veterans Health Administration (VA), the largest integrated healthcare system in the
United States; (2) Identify barriers and facilitators to implementation of prediction models in clinical practice
using mixed methods with an explanatory sequential design, incorporating a clinician survey followed by semi-
structured clinician interviews; and (3) Develop and test components of a prediction model implementation
strategy in a clinical setting, using Implementation Mapping.
Training Aims: Dr. Read will develop expertise in: (1) Developing advanced longitudinal prediction models
using a national dataset; (2) Using and applying mixed methods and implementation science frameworks to
identify barriers and facilitators to successful implementation of a prediction model; (3) Applying
Implementation Mapping to develop and test an implementation strategy for a novel clinical prediction model."
10836041,"Project Summary/Abstract
The ultimate goal of this mPI proposal is to address a fundamental gap in knowledge on the role of acetyl-CoA
metabolic reprogramming in regulating cyclin E-high ovarian cancer DNA damage response, transformation, and
response to therapy. The results from these studies could have a significant impact on the treatment of the ~20%
of high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) patients with high cyclin E expression, which are resistant to
emerging PARP inhibitor therapies due to proficiency in homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DNA repair.
This research plan focuses on assessing the experimentally and mechanistically determining the spaciotemporal
metabolic reprogramming of acetyl-CoA on histone hyperacetylation and enhancement of HR-mediated DNA
repair and whether this pathway can be targeted in cyclin E-high HGSOC patients in combination with emerging
PARP inhibitor therapies to obtain a synthetic lethality and sustained therapeutic response. The proposed studies
are based on our preliminary findings that glucose-derived acetyl-CoA is upregulated in cyclin E-high cells,
acetyl-CoA is spatially regulated in the cytoplasm and nucleus, and cyclin E-high cells display hyperacetylation
of histones known to be involved in HR repair. In line with these data, we will explore two overarching scientific
aims: 1) quantitatively dissect acetyl-CoA metabolic reprogramming in cyclin E-high HGSOC and its contribution
to HR-mediated DNA repair; and 2) to determine whether acetyl-CoA mediated epigenetic changes contributes
to ovarian tumorigenesis and therapeutic response. The completion of the scientific aims of this proposal will not
only provide new mechanistic insights into the interplay between the acetyl-CoA-mediated metabolic-epigenetic
axis during ovarian tumorigenesis, but will also establish targeting this axis as a strategy to improve therapeutic
outcome for HGSOC patients with high cyclin E. The proposed research is of high impact because the
mechanistic underpinning of these pathways has the potential to transform the management of HGSOC patients
with high cyclin E. As PARP inhibitors are being developed for many cancer types, studies will have far-reaching
implications for identifying novel strategies to inhibit HR-mediated DNA repair and develop future cancer
therapeutics strategies for a wide range of patients."
10879043,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The development
of targeted molecular therapies that inhibit mutant oncogenic proteins and immunotherapies that inhibit the PD-
1/PD-L1 pathway have improved outcomes for subsets of patients with NSCLC. However, targeted therapies
are only effective against NSCLCs that harbor actionable genetic alterations. In addition, anti-PD-1/PD-L1
immune checkpoint inhibitors are most effective against NSCLCs that express high levels of PD-L1 or have a
high tumor mutation burden. Thus, patients with NSCLCs that lack these features do not benefit from targeted
therapies and are less likely to benefit from immunotherapies, emphasizing the need to identify novel therapeutic
targets in this disease. This project seeks to characterize the XRN1 exoribonuclease, which functions in cellular
RNA degradation, as a target that may have broad therapeutic potential in NSCLC. My preliminary data show
that XRN1 inactivation induces cell lethality in a subset of human NSCLC cell lines. In an implantable mouse
tumor model, XRN1 deletion can synergize with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy to enhance tumor eradication. Aim 1
will define the molecular signaling pathways that mediate cell lethality after XRN1 deletion in a subset of human
NSCLC cell lines. Aim 2 will assess the impact of XRN1 deletion in mouse NSCLC models of anti-PD-1
immunotherapy. Aim 3 will determine whether XRN1 gene expression in human NSCLC tumors may serve as a
predictive biomarker for treatment response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. The long-term goals of the proposed
research are to gain fundamental insights into how RNA metabolism regulates cancer cell survival and anti-
tumor immunity and to establish RNA metabolism pathways as potential therapeutic targets in NSCLC.

 Autoimmune uveitis is a major cause of blindness for which no cure and limited treatment options are
available. We found that CUB domain-containing protein 1 (CDCP1) knockout (KO) mice are protected from
experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) induced by adoptive transfer of pre-activated uveitogenic T cells,
suggesting that CDCP1 facilitates pathogenic T cell infiltration through the blood–retina barrier (BRB) to induce
EAU. In pilot mechanistic studies, we discovered that CDCP1 is selectively expressed on retinal pigmented
epithelial cells (RPEs) in the retina and identified CD71, an established T cell activation marker, as a new ligand
of CDCP1 in addition to CD6, another T cell marker. Stimulation with CD6 or CD71 induced CDCP1-mediated
RPE cytoskeletal remodeling, a process known to impair epithelial barrier functions, and increased RPE
production of IL-6, a pathogenic cytokine known to disrupt the endothelial barrier integrity. These intriguing data
provide strong evidence in support of CDCP1 as a novel immunoregulator that interacts with CD6 and CD71 on
T cells to facilitate pathogenic T cell infiltration through the BRB to induce EAU. Further, our data suggest that
CDCP1 could be targeted for treating autoimmune uveitis. In this proposed study, we aim to use the unique
reagents that we have developed or obtained in our preliminary studies to elucidate the detailed mechanisms by
which CDCP1 regulates both the outer and inner BRB to facilitate T cell infiltration into the retina, and to
determine the potential of CDCP1-targeted therapeutics using various conditional KO mice and our already
developed anti-CDCP1 monoclonal antibodies and nanobodies. The proposed work should provide novel
insights into our understanding of the pathogenesis of autoimmune uveitis and open new avenues of research
in which CDCP1 is explored as a key immunoregulator and new therapeutic target for this blinding disease."
10877190,"Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) are Gram-positive, facultative intracellular bacteria that cause two types of brain
infections in humans: diffuse (meningitis/meningoencephalitis) and focal brainstem (rhombencephalitis).
Meningitis occurs in the setting of immune compromise, likely due to the failure of the immune system to limit
exponential growth of Lm in tissues such as spleen or liver. This leads to high titer bacteremia and either direct
invasion of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) or “stealth transport” of Lm associated with myeloid-derived cells that
cross the BBB. In contrast, rhombencephalitis is an infection of a delayed nature that occurs in young, otherwise
healthy immune competent people, which suggests that the infection is dependent on bacterially encoded
neurovirulence factors. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the virulence factors which define
neurotropism during rhombencephalitis mediate critical early events in the intestines, rather than in the brain.
Support for this hypothesis comes from our preliminary data showing that when the neurotropic Lm are injected
intravenously (bypassing the gut phase of the infection), they do not disseminate to the brain. In addition, others
showed that rhombencephalitis isolates did not have an increased ability to survive and replicate in bovine
organotypic brain slices ex vivo relative to other Lm strains. Until recently, rhombencephalitis could be studied
only in cows or sheep due to the lack of a small animal model of Lm brainstem infections. However, we recently
showed that some clinical isolates of Lm (UKVDL9 and SD4000) could preferentially colonize the brainstems of
mice late in the course of infection, without reaching high titer in the blood. Both of the neurotropic strains we
reported belong to lineage III, the smallest and least characterized group of Lm isolates. The goal of this proposal
is to define the factors that promote neurotropism by Lm UKVDL9 and SD4000 during the gut phase of listeriosis.
We predict that neurotropic Lm could have an advantage in three different aspects of the intestinal infection;
these form the three Specific Aims of the proposal. In Aim 1, we determine if the route used to cross the gut
mucosa or inflammatory response induced promotes localization of neurotropic Lm strains in neural bundles in
the intestinal submucosa or within the vagal crypt endings surrounding lymphoid cryptopatches in the gut. In
Aim 2, we identify the novel Lm surface protein that mediates enhanced invasion of enteric glial cells, the cell
type that surrounds nerves in the gut. In Aim 3, we test the hypothesis that a truncated actA allele found in
neurotropic Lm promotes an altered type of intracellular movement that allows the bacteria to migrate along the
entire length of an axon all the way to the brainstem. This work will move the listeriosis field forward by providing
the first real insights into neurotropism during this life-threatening foodborne infection and could also lay the
groundwork for new areas of pathogenesis or microbiome-related research to understand how bacteria interact
with cells of the enteric nervous system."

Suicide is a leading cause of death for adolescents worldwide, and rates have increased over the past decade.
Yet, we lack reliable predictors of suicidal behavior (SB) due in part to a need to consider a broader range of
risk processes and methods of assessment. There is a particularly critical and urgent need for research on
objective, prospective predictors of SB to identify youth at greatest risk and elucidate novel targets for
intervention. The goal of this study is to characterize alterations in RDoC’s Positive Valence Systems,
particularly neural processes involve in reward valuation, in a large, high-risk sample of adolescents in acute
psychiatric treatment for self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs) who will be followed for 6 months
following discharge—a period of high risk for SB. Our preliminary data and theories of SB highlight a key role
of reward valuation in that SB partly reflects a choice between immediate relief from emotional pain rather than
waiting for potential future rewards that come from continuing to live through difficult times. Consistent with
this, rigorous cross-sectional research has linked SB to greater discounting of the value of delayed monetary
rewards, and our preliminary data indicate enhanced neural responsiveness to immediate relative to delayed
rewards in youth with recent SB. Importantly, preferences for immediate rather than delayed reinforcers are
known to increase in times of high stress, and acute interpersonal stress is associated with elevated risk for SB
in adolescents, while social support tends to be protective. This multi-method, prospective study will test an
innovative conceptual model of SB by which youth with enhanced neural reactivity to immediate reinforcers
and blunted reactivity to delayed rewards are more likely to engage in SB, particularly in times of acute
interpersonal stress, and social support buffers effects of reward valuation on SB. We will recruit a
transdiagnostic sample of adolescents (ages 13-17 years; N=300) in acute psychiatric treatment for SITBs.
Participants will complete clinical assessments and behavioral and neural measures of reward valuation in the
hospital to capture a high-risk state and minimize participant burden. Following discharge, participants will
complete a brief daily survey of interpersonal stress, social support, and SITBs for 90 days. Finally, participants
will complete follow-up interviews of SITBs 6 months after discharge to test prospective predictors of SB. This
study will characterize patterns of reward valuation associated with SB histories in high-risk youth (Aim 1),
examine neural measures of reward valuation as prospective predictors of SB following hospital discharge
(Aim 2), and examine the interplay between neural reward valuation and interpersonal factors in the proximal
prediction of SB (Aim 3). This study directly addresses NIMH priorities and will be the first to examine neural
predictors of future SB in a large, high-risk sample of youth, extending RDoC-informed research on suicide risk
to the Positive Valence Systems domain. This research will lead to the identification of objective predictors of
SB risk and the development of more personalized, targeted interventions to prevent SB and suicide deaths."

The COVID-19 pandemic poses a sustained threat to the wellbeing of all children, but particularly for low-
income, racially minoritized, and special needs subgroups. This unpredictable, complex, racialized crisis has
exposed millions of children to massive disruptions of their educational contexts when schools closed, with
growing accounts of associated learning loss, social isolation, and emotional distress. Scholars have mobilized
to study the pandemic, yet much of this emerging research draws on small, relatively homogeneous (mostly
white) samples, limiting applicability to the subgroups most affected by this pandemic and its multisystem
disruptions (e.g., Latinx [including ELL]; Black; children with special needs). Little of this new research contains
extensive, repeated measures of pre-COVID-19 child functioning. Nor does it capture the multisystem
culturally-embedded protective factors likely to influence short- and longer-term developmental recovery for the
current US child population. Thus, there is an urgent need for culturally-relevant, longitudinal research
spanning the period from before the pandemic and continuing, on diverse samples of children to inform current
and future pandemic preparation and response efforts. The proposed project fills this gap by capturing
children’s pre-k-1st grade pre-pandemic functioning and following them through - and well beyond - the period
of widespread quarantines and school closures, as they enter adolescence. Leveraging data from an existing,
ongoing, large, highly diverse sample of low-income students in Title I schools who have been followed since
they were preschoolers in 2016, the proposed study will (Aim 1a) determine the impacts of COVID-19
disruptions when schools were closed on children’s short-term outcomes in the years immediately following
school reopening (3rd-5th grade); (Aim 1b) investigate how short-term outcomes are exacerbated or mitigated
by individual differences in children’s pre-COVID-19 strengths and vulnerabilities; (Aim 2a) explore the longer-
term impacts of disruption on development by adding repeated measurement of children’s outcomes in the
longer term following school reopening, through 9th grade; and (2b) identify the most potent features of
children’s post-school-reopening family, school, and peer contexts – including culturally-embedded family
factors – that mitigate the longer-term impacts (through 9th grade) of COVID-19 disruption on recovery of
consequential early adolescent outcomes, including mental health. By determining effects of educational and
family-based disruptions during school closures, and family disruptions that continue after schools reopened,
on varying developmental trajectories, and identifying culturally-embedded protective factors, this project
moves well beyond identifying risk groups to specifying shared and unique aspects of children’s family, school,
and peer contexts that promote long-term resilience in a highly diverse sample. It thus holds tremendous
promise for advancing knowledge to improve public health and inform current and future disaster preparation,
relief, and recovery efforts tailored to children especially susceptible to negative outcomes."

 This renewal application builds on our discovery that the shape of nanoparticle-based constructs—what we
define as structural valency—plays a key role in preserving the targeting ligand characteristics of nanoconstructs
even when coated by a protein corona. Protein corona formation and its impact on engineered physicochemical
properties of nanoconstructs has been somewhat controversial but is generally accepted to affect cell and tissue
targeting specificity and downstream biological effects. Using single-particle, live-cell imaging investigations, we
found that the protein corona composition of an ensemble of nanoconstructs was superseded by single-particle
shape effects. Compared to their spherical counterparts, nanoconstructs with branched structures retained their
ligand shell targeting capabilities both on cell membranes and within cells and cellular compartments. Statistically
significant differences in the time-resolved dynamics of differently shaped nanoconstructs interacting with cellular
components cannot be attributed to very minimal variations in protein corona composition.
 We aim to determine the mechanism for how branched nanoconstructs maintain their targeting functionality
in biological environments and then to modulate the spatial organization of the single-particle protein corona with
light during live-cell interactions. We will tune the nanoscale features of the branched nanoconstructs, including
overall size, branch length, and tip radii of curvature, to be commensurate with membrane receptor dimerization
and curvature-induced endosomal signaling and will image interactions at the single-particle level. The specific
aims include (1) Understand how nanoconstruct design and optical stimuli can manipulate the protein corona at
the single-particle level; (2) Investigate structural multivalency of membrane-targeting branched nanoconstructs
on receptor dimerization; (3) Improve intracellular targeting and delivery using branched nanoconstruct shapes.
This work is expected to be of high impact for precision nanomedicine by the intersection of single-nanoparticle
advances with mechanistic insight into biological responses. Our ability to resolve nanoparticle-cell interactions
at relevant time and length scales for receptor recognition and internalization will benefit knowledge in protein
dimerization and nanoscale curvature effects and deepen understanding of endocytosis and immunomodulatory
responses—key processes for advancements in vaccine design and drug delivery."
10866528,"Project Summary/Abstract
Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) affects more than two-thirds of adults with
invasive cancer who receive select adjuvant chemotherapies (e.g., taxanes, platinum analogs).
Severe CIPN symptoms can lead to chemotherapy dose reductions, treatment delays, or
changes in treatment regimens; thereby affecting the potential curative effects of chemotherapy.
For some patients, CIPN symptoms can persist over time, contributing to lower quality of life.
 Little is known about risk factors for CIPN. Chemotoxicity risk scores have been developed
and evaluated for use among elderly patients receiving chemotherapy. However, these tools
generally report moderate predictive accuracy (60%-70%), small sample sizes, and short-term
follow up. We are aware of no publicly available, validated risk models to assess risk of severe
and chronic CIPN among diverse patients at risk for this potentially disabling side effect.
 The goal of this proposal is to identify patients at risk for CIPN and to understand how
patients and provider interpret and use CIPN risk information in clinical decision-making.
Focusing on more than 8,500 insured adults (18+) diagnosed with invasive, stage I-III breast
and II-IIIA colorectal cancers (2013-2021) who received adjuvant chemotherapy treatment with
known risk for CIPN, we will develop and validate predictive models to quantify the risk of
severe CIPN and incident chronic CIPN and assess how CIPN risk information might be used to
inform clinical decision-making about cancer treatment and survivorship care planning.
 We hypothesize that CIPN risk is a high priority for patients in thinking about treatment
choice and survivorship care planning. In addition, we hypothesize that the relative importance
of CIPN risk for patient and provider decision-making will vary by patient characteristics (e.g.,
age, cancer stage). We anticipate that the risk of severe and chronic CIPN can be predicted
with a high degree of accuracy using electronic health records and machine learning methods.
 The study team has significant and complementary expertise in health services research,
biostatistics and predictive modeling, oncology practice, cancer epidemiology,
pharmacotherapy, drug safety and the patient care experience. To our knowledge, this will be
one of the first studies to develop and validate a CIPN predictive model that can be used by
oncology teams to inform treatment and care planning decisions and improve patient-valued
outcomes. Translation and replication of the findings will be catalyzed through publication in
peer-reviewed journals and the development and distribution of free software to facilitate testing
and adaptation of the resulting risk models across diverse systems of care."
10836025,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Together, tobacco and alcohol kill more than half a million people in the United States every year, making co-
addiction to these substances the leading cause of preventable death. We propose a contingency management
(CM) paradigm based on point-of-care urine tests that measure ethyl glucuronide. Theoretically framed within
the Addiction Neuroclinical Assessment (ANA) with hypothesized mechanisms in core domains (i.e., incentive
salience, negative emotionality and cognitive function), and proceeding from a sound and innovative scientific
premise, we will, for the first time, target smoking and alcohol use by implementing an evidence-based behavioral
treatment (CM) for alcohol among participants who have initiated frontline pharmacotherapy (varenicline; VC)
for smoking cessation. This project seeks to replicate, harness and extend our previous findings from secondary
analyses and pilot studies, which demonstrate that applying CM to target the use of alcohol can produce non-
targeted reductions in smoking. We will do so by offering CM for alcohol use to smokers who are simultaneously
initiating smoking cessation pharmacotherapy. We also seek to identify the most potent ANA-based mediators
(e.g., incentive salience given that CM’s focus is on alternative reinforcement) of behavior change in response
to treatment. Lastly, we will examine the extent to which biologic sex and baseline alcohol use and cigarette
smoking interacts with CM to produce different levels of reduced alcohol use and cigarette smoking. Patients will
take part in a 2-arm randomized controlled trial to evaluate the ability of a CM intervention to reduce alcohol use
and cigarette smoking. After completing a 2-week induction period, patients will be randomized into 2 trial arms
for a 12-week treatment period: 1) a CM intervention group that receives smoking cessation treatment as usual
(TAU), which includes varenicline and counseling, and 2) a non-contingent (NC) control group that also receives
TAU. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Determine if CM+TAU is more effective than NC+TAU for reducing alcohol
use and cigarette smoking. We hypothesize that CM will yield lower rates of biochemically-verified alcohol use
and cigarette smoking, concurrent biochemically-verified alcohol use and smoking, and self-reported drinks per
day, cigarettes per day, and heavy drinking days during the 12-week treatment and 6-month follow-up periods.
3) Identify the most potent ANA-based mediators of treatment response across the treatment groups. We
hypothesize that higher executive dysfunction, negative emotionality, and alcohol- and smoking-related incentive
salience will be associated with higher levels of alcohol use and cigarette smoking across treatments and over
time; 3) Determine if biological sex or baseline severity of alcohol use and smoking interacts with treatment
assignment to produce differential changes in our primary and secondary outcomes. We hypothesize that
biological sex will significantly interact with treatment to produce differential outcomes, and that those with less
severity of alcohol use and smoking at baseline will experience better outcomes. This investigation will support
future studies that can identify personalized treatment for different sub-groups of smokers with an AUD."

Disparities” to address this gap. The Integrative Theme of our UNC TCORS is building the science for
effective regulation of and communication about tobacco products disproportionately used by priority
populations – flavored tobacco products and e-cigarettes. Our integrated set of four Research Projects seek to
understand the impact of regulations and communication campaigns on those disadvantaged by tobacco use
disparities, including Black; lower-socioeconomic status (SES); and lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB)
populations; and youth and young adults. Our ultimate goal is to further FDA and NIH efforts to protect public
health through regulation of tobacco products. UNC TCORS’ research will provide essential evidence to guide
the FDA as it implements bans on menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars, develops communication
campaigns, and addresses the youth vaping epidemic. We propose four Specific Aims: 1) Develop and
evaluate the impact of communication campaigns to discourage tobacco product use in diverse populations
(Projects 1, 2, 4); 2) Understand the public health impact of flavored tobacco product bans in diverse
populations and the conditions under which they are most likely to be most effective (Projects 2 and 3); 3) Build
trainees’ capacity to contribute to the field of tobacco regulatory science through training, mentorship, and pilot
funding for a diverse and multidisciplinary group of pre-doctoral fellows, post-doctoral fellows, and early-stage
investigators (Projects 1-4, Career Enhancement Core); 4) Inform FDA regulation of menthol cigarette and
flavored cigar bans and communication campaigns through active dissemination of TCORS scientific findings
(Projects 1-4, Administrative Core). Project 1 will develop a novel communication campaign to discourage
young adult little cigar and cigarillo use. Project 2 will evaluate whether a menthol cigarette ban could be
amplified by a quit smoking campaign to help menthol smokers quit, including Black and LGB smokers. Project
3 will build a microsimulation model to estimate the public health impact of a federal flavored cigar ban on
tobacco use, mortality, and health disparities. Project 4 will test the ability of vaping prevention video ads with
promising features to reduce susceptibility to vaping among youth and young adults. The Research Projects
will receive support from two Cores: Administrative and Career Enhancement (which includes Pilot Research
Projects). Our multidisciplinary group of seasoned regulatory science researchers will provide actionable
information to inform FDA regulations and communication campaigns."
10934532,"OVERALL - ABSTRACT
The US Food and Drug Administration has the authority to regulate tobacco products to protect public health.
Regulatory measures that address constituents that contribute to the appeal and addiction of tobacco products
are critically needed. The FDA has proposed plans to regulate nicotine concentration in cigarettes and flavors in
many tobacco products and needs rigorous scientific evidence to support these plans and defend legal
challenges. Currently, important gaps remain in our understanding of how nicotine and flavor additives influence
the appeal of and addiction to tobacco products and how these constituents might influence initiation and support
harm reduction. Moreover, recent “disruptive innovations” directed at nicotine and flavor additives and introduced
by the tobacco industry, have led to new unknowns. To address these gaps in knowledge, the Yale Center
for the Study of Tobacco Products (YCSTP) brings together a multidisciplinary team to investigate the
effects of different forms and concentrations of nicotine (tobacco-derived, synthetic, freebase/salt),
constituents that add cooling (menthol, odorless synthetic coolants), and constituents that add
sweetness (humectants, sweeteners) delivered via different routes and products (oral, inhaled,
intravenous) on initiation, addiction and harm reduction. Project 1 (Jordt/Addy) will examine if odorless
cooling flavors, sweeteners, humectants, and different nicotine stereoisomers impact initiation, nicotine
preference, reinforcement, and transitions in use form adolescence to adulthood. Project 2 (Sofuoglu) will
determine if thresholds for nicotine reinforcement, discrimination, and subjective reward are altered by nicotine
dependence and exposure to sweeteners. Project 3 (Krishnan-Sarin) will examine if odorless synthetic coolants
and synthetic nicotine racemic mixtures alter the appeal and addiction potential of nicotine-containing e-
cigarettes. Project 4 (Fucito/Bold) will examine the impact of potential regulations of flavors and nicotine
concentration in non-combustible tobacco products (nicotine pouches, e-cigarettes) on switching from
combustible tobacco products. The YCSTP will be supported by a Measurement and Analytics Core
(Morean/Gueorguieva) that will provide and develop psychometrically sound measures and rigorous statistical
analyses, a Laboratory Core (Eid/Zimmerman) that will provide chemical analyses of new and existing tobacco
products and biological estimates of tobacco/nicotine exposure and health/toxicity biomarkers, a Career
Enhancement Core (O’Malley/Kong) that will train fellows and junior faculty in tobacco regulatory science and
provide pilot funding, and an Administrative Core (Krishnan-Sarin/O’Malley) that will ensure the generation of
rigorous science through scientific, regulatory, and community oversight as well as facilitate intra- and inter-
TCORS communications and collaborations. We will build on the methods and findings from our prior TCORS
and integrate biological and behavioral testing in animal models with behavioral and pharmacological testing in
humans to generate a firm scientific foundation for regulation of nicotine and flavor additives in tobacco products."

 This proposal aims to elucidate the structure and mechanism of action of three ion channels and
transporters of viruses and bacteria. Pathogenic organisms use their membrane-bound ion channels
and transporters for survival. Molecular structural information about these membrane proteins forms the
basis for rational design of antiviral and antibiotic compounds to fight and prevent viral and bacterial
infections. We propose to 1) determine the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) protein, which
assembles into a cation-selective channel that stimulates the host inflammasome; 2) investigate the
structural mechanism of the influenza M2 protein, which forms an acid-activated tetrameric proton
channel for influenza virus uncoating; 3) determine the structure of a multidrug-resistant bacterial
transporter, EmrE, to elucidate the mechanisms of proton-coupled substrate transport. These
membrane proteins – E, M2, and EmrE – are drug targets to curb the COVID-19 pandemic, influenza
infections, and antibiotic resistance. In Aim 1 we will investigate the structural basis of the proton
conduction direction in M2 proteins by examining an influenza B M2 (BM2) mutant. Wild-type (WT) AM2
conducts protons only inward, like a transporter, while WT BM2 conducts protons bidirectionally, like a
canonical channel. This difference is correlated with recent data that AM2 undergoes alternating-access
motions to activate while BM2 undergoes a scissor-like motion to activate. To understand these
differences, we will study a BM2 mutant that recapitulates the AM2 inward-rectifying phenotype. We will
measure its structure and dynamics using multidimensional solid-state NMR spectroscopy and correlate
the structural information with channel activities. In Aim 2 we will determine the SARS-CoV-2 E protein’s
transmembrane (TM) structure in lipid bilayers. We will investigate the E structures under different cation
concentrations, pH and with a bound inhibitor, to understand how E conducts cations and how the
conductance can be blocked. 2D and 3D correlation solid-state NMR experiments will be carried out in
conjunction with channel activity measurement. In Aim 3 we will investigate the conformation and
membrane interaction of the cytoplasmic region of E by 31P and 13C NMR, to address the mechanism of
action of the second function of the E protein, which is mediating virus budding and release. In Aim 4,
we will investigate EmrE, which effluxes cationic drugs in a proton-coupled manner to cause antibiotic
resistance in E. coli. We will employ multidimensional 19F NMR techniques to measure protein-drug
distances to constrain the structure of the substrate-binding pocket. These studies should provide
detailed structural insights into the mechanism of membrane transport in some of the most devastating
viruses and bacteria, and should establish the basis for drug design to improve human health."

This application is in response to the PAR-19-250: “EnvironmentalInfluences on Aging: Effects of Extreme
Weatherand Disaster Events on Aging Populations .”Air pollutants are especially detrimental for aging
populations; exposure to air pollution as measured by ambient particulate matter (e.g., PM2.5) has been linked
to diseases that increase with age, including cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and stroke. Older women (who
outnumber men 3:2) are particularly susceptible to CVD endpoints and to stroke risk in particular; stroke risk in
women doubles immediately following menopause. Extreme weather events such as wildfires and prolonged
drought in the last decade alone have adversely affected air pollution exposure in states such as California. A
number of metropolitan counties in the state have particulate pollution levels above federal and state ambient
standards, and during extreme weather events, these levels rival that of the worst cities in the world. Our
overall study objective is to evaluate the intersection of extreme weather events and air pollution in an
aging female population who are at increased risk for CVDs, and in particular, at peak susceptibility for
stroke. In Aim1, we will evaluate the acute effects from wildfire events by ascertaining stroke events within
geographically affected areas based on satellite imagery. Elevated PM2.5 exposure estimates resulting from a
wildfire event in the affected areas will be associated with hospitalizations (including emergency room visits)
from stroke and CVD. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of specific PM2.5 components in stroke risk and
mortality. Employing complementary satellite- and source-based approaches, we will identify key sources of
PM2.5 and its chemical constituents that are attributable to stroke. Leveraging 25-years of follow-up from the
study population, this aim will permit us to delineate components of air pollution from drought and wildfire
events versus other (e.g., transportation, industrial) exposures. For both aims, select CVD endpoints (e.g.,
myocardial infarction) will also be explored. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the association between PM2.5 exposure
with serum immune markers among 2000 participants whose exposures reflect a cross-section of exposure
during the 2015 drought and wildfire season. This aim will inform the purported biologic underpinning for stroke
and CVD risk, by key PM2.5 sources and constituents. To successfully accomplish these aims, we will leverage
longitudinal data from the California Teachers Study, a geographically-defined population-based cohort study
of 133,479 women whose 25 year follow-up spans: (a) key periods of stroke and CVD susceptibility in women,
and (b) elevated levels of air pollution exposure in California where there have been prolonged periods of
drought and numerous wildfires."
10893504,"High dimensional atlas of circulating neutrophils as reporters of solid organ functional status
 Chronic solid organ diseases (CSODs) collectively account for the majority of deaths in the United
States. A central goal in modern medicine is to improve our ability to predict and detect CSODs in order to
initiate successful therapeutic interventions early or to install appropriate early preventive measures. Several
approaches have been devised to facilitate early detection of disease, including genetic testing and screening
modalities such as imaging and laboratory tests. However, considerable number of CSODs lay silent and
escape even the most watchful clinical eyes, only appearing when it is too late to reverse the pathophysiology
of the disease. The identification of a non-invasive, accessible, sensitive, and comprehensive reporter system
that simultaneously appraises the status of many solid organs would widen the window of opportunity for
therapeutic intervention before overt disease occurs.
 Cellular injury and damage, which precede all organ-based disease, trigger an immune response that
may be transcriptionally encoded into surveilling immune cells. The blood circulation accesses all solid organs
and therefore provides an excellent portal into organ status. Specifically, neutrophils, the most abundant
immune cells in humans, infiltrates nearly all organs under homeostasis. Contrary to their reputation as mere
non-specific anti-microbial combatants, neutrophils have evolved as heterogeneous, functionally versatile cells
that participate in organ homeostasis and mediate CSODs. The advent of high-dimensional approaches such
as single-cell cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have revealed
numerous previously unknown neutrophil subpopulations with distinct transcriptional features. Moreover,
tissue-infiltrating neutrophils assume specific organ-defined signatures. Unique from other immune cells,
neutrophils do not establish permanent residence in the tissues they sojourn. This feature coupled with the
neutrophils' short half-life yet significant transcriptional malleability renders them excellent candidates to serve
as sentinels and reporters of organ status. In short, neutrophils that have infiltrated organs potentially return
into the systemic circulation with vital organ-specific codes that may predict homeostatic state compared to
perturbed, diseased states. This proposal will capitalize on these features of neutrophils to create a
comprehensive atlas of their transcriptomics signatures, such that any tissue-specific dysregulation would be
detected as an alteration in these transcriptional signatures. If successful, we envision a clinical world where
blood analysis of neutrophil transcriptomic features would unveil lurking disease far before symptoms develop,
prompting early intervention."

Although there is much hope for an effective vaccine to combat COVID-19, a pressing need remains to develop
direct acting antivirals in the event that vaccines fail to provide protective immunity, for the treatment of acute
infections, and for future coronavirus strains that might evade existing vaccines. The SARS coronavirus (CoV-
2) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is an attractive target because inhibitors of viral RNA-dependent
polymerases form the cornerstone of antiviral drug combination therapy for successful treatment of HIV and
hepatitis C virus infections. Remdesivir, a nucleotide analog developed by Gilead, is already showing promise
in clinical trials. The long-term goal of this research is to facilitate the development of more effective, less toxic
drugs directed against the SARS CoV-2 RdRp. The rationale for this research is based on prior experience
demonstrating that accurate measurements of the kinetics of nucleotide incorporation and excision by the viral
polymerase/exonuclease translates directly to understanding viral RNA replication and can guide the design of
robust assays to find effective inhibitors. Kinetic analysis will be based on single turnover rapid-kinetic
measurements of polymerization to provide definitive results to define the mechanistic basis for nucleotide
selectivity. Our working hypothesis is that an effective nucleotide analog can be identified and its therapeutic
potential quantified based on analysis of the kinetics of incorporation relative to the kinetics of excision by the
proofreading exonuclease. Specifically, the aims of this research are to quantify the kinetics of nucleotide
incorporation using single turnover kinetic analysis in order to establish the mechanism and overall fidelity of the
RNA replication. Parallel studies will establish the kinetic and mechanistic basis for inhibition for nucleotide
analogs. We will also include extensive characterization of the kinetics of the proofreading exonuclease to define
the rules governing removal of mismatched base pairs and nucleotide analogs. We will also us cryoEM with
samples based on our biochemical knowledge to obtain structures of the polymerase with Remdesivir
incorporated and of the RdRp with the exonuclease. These studies are innovative in that they take advantage of
the most advanced methods of single turnover kinetic analysis and global data fitting developed by the PI to
establish the kinetic and thermodynamic basis for polymerase specificity to reveal the basis for discrimination
against nucleotide analogs. No other lab is applying such standards to this important problem. Moreover, this
quantitative analysis provides an accurate vector pointing toward more effective inhibitors in structure/activity
relationship studies. The work is soundly based the the PI's prior work and on preliminary data explaining the
kinetic basis for the effectiveness of Remdesivir in competing with ATP. The proposed research will significantly
advance our understanding the mechanism and kinetics of CoV RNA replication and provide a sound quantitative
basis to find inhibitors acting directly against viral replication. This research has a strong potential to play a key
role in the developing direct acting antiviral drugs to combat SARS CoV-2 and future coronaviruses."
10824272,"Project Abstract
Breast cancer, the most prevalent cancer in women, is responsible for more than 15% of new
cancer cases and about 6.9% of all cancer-related death in the US. A major cause of therapeutic
failure in breast cancer is the development of resistance to chemotherapy, especially for triple-
negative breast cancer (TNBC), a type of breast cancer considered to be more aggressive and
have a poorer prognosis than other types of breast cancer. Therefore, how to overcome
chemoresistance is the major challenge to improve the life expectancy of TNBC patients.
Preliminary data demonstrate that TNBC cells surviving from the chronic treatment of
chemotherapeutic drugs show significantly higher expression of a special protein kinase, dual
serine/threonine and tyrosine protein kinase (DSTYK), than parental cells without treatment.
Additionally, from both in vitro and in vivo results, we found that both the knockout of DSTYK and
exosome-mediated DSTYK silence can lead to the apoptosis of chemoresistant cells upon drug
treatment. This novel finding suggests that DSTYK exerts a previously unknown and important
role in promoting chemoresistance. The objective of this proposal is to elucidate the novel role
and the underpinning mechanism of DSTYK in regulating chemoresistance in TNBC cells and
further explore the potential of exosome-mediated DSTYK silence in TNBC chemotherapy with
preclinical models. We hypothesize that DSTYK is a novel target for chemotherapy to induce
TNBC cell death. We will test our hypothesis with three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will investigate
the mechanism by which DSTYK promotes chemoresistance in TNBC cells. In Aim 2, we will
establish DSTYK as a prognostic biomarker in clinical TNBC. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the
therapeutic benefit of DSTYK-siRNA-exosomes in chemotherapy. We engineered exosomes
containing siRNA against DSTYK that can specifically target TNBC cells. We found these
engineered exosomes can significantly promote tumor regression and inhibit metastasis in both
cellular and orthotopic models treated with drugs. Successful completion of the proposed studies
will provide fundamental insights into the role of DSTYK in chemoresistance in TNBC cells and
will lay the essential foundation for the development of an exosome-mediated strategy targeting
DSTYK to significantly improve clinical TNBC chemotherapy."
10860998,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSRACT
Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), including the partial opioid agonist buprenorphine, provide a
treatment option for opioid use disorder (OUD) that significantly reduces morbidity and mortality. Even with
successful buprenorphine initiation, however, adherence is paramount to prevent return to non-medical opioid
use and its associated risks. Current methods of determining buprenorphine adherence are limited by their
retrospective nature and recall bias. We propose to develop a novel artificial intelligence-assisted wearable
sensor system, MINDER, which will continuously monitor physiologic changes, and will use machine learning
algorithms to accurately identify buprenorphine use. The MINDER system will be comprised of a custom
wearable sensor (MINDER-band), a companion mobile app and a clinician facing portal. The MINDER-band,
which is a low profile, upper arm band with a user-driven design, continuously records physiologic data. We will
use the band to curate a high-quality dataset of MOUD ingestions and subsequently use machine learning to
evaluate the ability of the sensor to detect MOUD (specifically buprenorphine) ingestion events. Finally, we will
deploy the MINDER system in real-world MOUD treatment settings to understand usability factors. The
investigative team brings together complementary expertise in toxicology/addiction medicine, mobile health
(Carreiro, Smelson), machine learning, human computer interaction (Venkatasubramanian), novel on-body
wearable sensors, and medical device development (Mankodiya, Solanki). The specific aims of the project are
to: 1) Understand the requirements, barriers, and facilitators for an ML driven buprenorphine adherence support
system, 2) Develop and test a novel wearable sensing system, MINDER, designed for individuals in
buprenorphine treatment, 3) Curate a high quality annotated dataset for machine learning-based modeling of
buprenorphine adherence, 4) Model the buprenorphine ingestion data collected from the MINDER-band to
build the ML algorithms infrastructure for the MINDER system. Upon completion, the MINDER system will be
ready for clinical deployment. This study will lay the groundwork for novel just-in-time adaptive behavioral
interventions to personalize OUD treatment, improve buprenorphine adherence and its success, and ultimately
reduce morbidity and mortality from OUD."
10847469,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cushing’s disease (CD) is a serious endocrine disorder characterized by an adrenocorticotropic hormone
(ACTH)-secreting PitNET that subsequently stimulates the adrenal glands to overproduce cortisol. Chronic
exposure to excess cortisol has wide ranging and detrimental effects on health, including increased stroke rates,
diabetes, obesity, depression, anxiety and death. Although CD is linked to a threefold increase in the risk of
death, the advancement of current standard of care medical therapy is lacking. Current treatments exhibit low
efficacy and tolerability for patients. The absence of preclinical models that replicate the complexity of the
adenoma tissue has prevented us from developing effective therapies that are targeted to the tumor directly. The
first-line treatment for CD is pituitary surgery. In the hands of an experienced surgeon, tumor recurrence occurs
in as many as 30% to 50% of patients during the 10-year follow-up period. Despite multiple treatments,
biochemical control is not achieved in approximately 50% of patients, suggesting that in routine clinical practice,
initial and long-term disease remission is not achieved in a substantial number of CD patients . Hence, medical
therapy is often considered in the following situations: when surgery is contraindicated or fails to achieve
remission, or when recurrence occurs after apparent surgical remission. While stereotactic radiosurgery treats
incompletely resected or recurrent PitNETs, the main drawbacks include the longer time to remission and the
risk of hypopituitarism. There is an inverse relationship between disease duration and reversibility of
complications associated with CD, thus emphasizing the importance of targeting the pituitary adenoma early.
The primary barrier to developing new medical therapies is the lack of human relevant advanced in vitro tumor
models. Pituitary cell lines do not reproduce the multicellular complexity of PitNETs. In this instance, the overall
objective is to develop PitNET organoids to advance our understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of
pituitary tumors in CD patients. The overall goal will be successfully achieved by collaborative efforts between
the University of Arizona (UA) and Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) that will leverage the expertise of
professionals trained in complimentary fields including surgical treatments, pathology and cell biology of pituitary
disease, organoid technology and high throughput data analysis including dug screening, molecular profiling,
and transcriptomics. This led us to develop Specific Aims: 1) To use human PitNET derived organoids to define
the molecular signatures of corticotroph tumor subtypes in CD, and 2) To use the pituitary tumor organoids as a
preclinical model to accelerate targeted therapies for patients with CD. At the completion of the funding period,
we will be positioned to implement patient-relevant organoids to accelerate the development of therapies that
will effectively target ACTH-secreting pituitary adenomas in patients with CD."
10836553,"The epigenome comprises a critical layer for controlling gene expression and genome function. Cancer
mutations often alter the function of chromatin complexes, leading to aberrant epigenomic landscapes frequently
observed in tumor cells. Determining the mechanisms controlling chromatin complexes and their interactions will
advance our understanding of epigenomic processes, how they are disrupted in cancer, and how they can be
pharmacologically modulated for drug discovery. Consequently, our central goals are to elucidate the
mechanisms of chromatin complexes and test their promise as therapeutic targets. In this pursuit, this application
investigates lysine-specific histone demethylase-1 (LSD1), a transcriptional corepressor that is a drug target for
oncology. LSD1 forms complexes with various corepressors and transcription factors (TF), including GFI1B,
which are critically involved in development and implicated across various tumor types. Using drug-resistance
alleles obtained from a chemical suppressor screen, our prior work showed that LSD1 active site inhibitors exert
their anti-proliferative effects by disrupting the LSD1-GFI1B complex, revising prior models of drug mechanism
of action. Notably, GFI1B is frequently overexpressed by enhancer hijacking mutations in group 3 and 4
medulloblastoma (MB), and LSD1 inhibitors are effective in GFI1B-driven MB mouse models. Intriguingly, the
E3 ubiquitin ligase KBTBD4 is also frequently mutated in group 3/4 MB and was recently reported to mediate
degradation of CoREST, LSD1’s obligate complex partner. These observations suggest a possible mechanistic
connection between GFI1B and KBTBD4 in group 3/4 MB, mediated through LSD1-CoREST. However, the
molecular interactions and interplay between LSD1-CoREST, GFI1B, and KBTBD4 remain unclear and present
a major gap in our understanding. To address these gaps, the first specific aim investigates the structure,
dynamics, and interactions of the LSD1-GFI1B complex through a multidisciplinary approach, with the goal of
revealing an unprecedented view into a chromatin regulator-TF complex. The second aim seeks to elucidate the
mechanism of small molecules that degrade LSD1-CoREST by potentiating KBTBD4 activity, providing critical
insight into strategies to target LSD1 complexes through new emerging modalities. The last aim studies how
KBTBD4 MB mutations promote LSD1-CoREST degradation and their downstream consequences on LSD1-
GFI1B and the MB cancer epigenome. Across these aims, the mechanisms and interactions of LSD1 complexes
will be explored by using innovative chemical genomic approaches that leverage drug suppressor alleles with
cell, molecular, and structural biology. It is expected that the findings from these studies will illuminate
biochemical principles governing the function and interactions of chromatin complexes and advance strategies
to pharmacologically target them for therapeutic applications."
10833166,"The Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS) is a longitudinal study using a national sample of community-dwelling

Health and Retirement Study (HRS), A key ancillary study of the MHAS is the Mex-Cog, part of the
Harmonized Cognitive Aging Protocol (HCAP), conducted in several countries to study Alzheimer's disease
and related dementias (ADRD) around the globe using population-based surveys like the MHAS. Two waves of
the Mex-Cog have been completed.
The long-term goal is to create new knowledge on aging and ADRD for Mexican older adults using a
population-based life course perspective. The MHAS is uniquely positioned to sustain research on emerging
themes such as COVID-19 and the related social inequities it revealed, providing a strong rationale for adding
follow-ups of the MHAS and Mex-Cog, and incorporating new themes to address these knowledge gaps, The
specific aims are to: 1) Support further research on the dynamics of aging in Mexico, by extending and
improving an existing national panel study, the MHAS. 2) Support further research on the dynamics of
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias around the globe, by extending an existing panel of Mex-Cog, an
ancillary study of the MHAS; and 3) Foster research on the dynamics of Mexican aging by expanding the
knowledge about and promoting the use of the databases and its related products. We will carry out waves 7
and 8 of the MHAS and Wave 3 of the Mex-Cog, We will add a rural over-sample, and incorporate new
themes: COVID-19, discrimination, use of languages, and use of technology for health care. We will collect
saliva samples in Mex-Cog 3 to support research on genetics of Alzheimer's disease. We will continue the
user-friendly web-based platforms and launch a new virtual data enclave to enhance global public access to
the data and project documentation.
The analytical significance of the new MHAS data will be exceptional, producing a national longitudinal study of
aging that spans over twenty-six years, which is unique for a low or middle-income country, The data platform
will enhance research on aging in general and ADRD more specifically, and related changes of physical and
mental health; physical and cognitive functionality; COVID-19 and other environmental risks; health behaviors
and health care use; family support; aging and the life course; wealth, income, labor and retirement; Mexico-U.S. migration; and mortality in a country aging fast with limited institutional support for individuals in old age,

comparable with similar studies in other countries."
10827956,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) plays an important role in the eye transporting nutrients, ions, and
water; and serving in absorption of light and protection against photooxidation, recycling of visual cycle
components, and providing essential factors for the structural integrity of the retina. Collectively these support
metabolic homeostasis and barrier function of the retina.
Many RPE disease phenotypes are shared between humans and mouse models carrying mutations in cell-
adhesion and extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules. Defining causative pathways and networks that are induced
by mutations or pathogenic variants may provide therapeutic targets. Identifying druggable targets that act during
the pre-symptomatic stage of the disease is particularly important to enable development of therapies that can
prevent, delay onset, or decrease the severity of RPE-associated diseases, irrespective of the initial cause of
the disease, before the pathologic changes become irreversible.
 The goal of this application is to identify shared pre-clinical and end-stage phenotypic and cellular effects of
mutations in two genes, Ctnna1 and Lratd2, which are highly expressed in the RPE and lead to similar retinal
defects. Mutations in CTNNA1 have been reported in patients with Pattern Dystrophy and Lebers Congenital
Amaurosis (LCA), and LRATD2 has been associated with early AMD in a genome wide association study. Our
approach is to use clinical, functional and biochemical tests to provide a deep characterization of the models and
to analyze associated cellular changes using single-nuclear transcriptomics as well as spatial
metabolomic/proteomic measurements. These phenotypic and genomics data will be jointly analyzed using
computational methods to identify the shared pathways perturbed in these models. Our use of two models with
shared pathologies will let us filter out mutation specific alterations and focus on the shared disease-causing
pathways. Using our mouse resources, we also plan to enhance current models.
 Successful completion of our studies will identify novel pathogenic pathways underlying RPE-related
disorders, revealing potential therapeutic targets that could be effective in a broad range of these diseases,
regardless of the cause of the disease. These well-characterized models will be made available to the research
community for further mechanistic inquiries as well as for testing therapeutic strategies."
10788456,"This proposal aims to fill a critical knowledge gap in the assembly of icosahedral viruses; mechanisms and
controls by which a viral genome flows into and out of a virus capsid with high precision and fidelity. The tailed
dsDNA bacteriophage T4 is our model virus. The proposal will also translate this basic knowledge into a gene
therapy for muscular dystrophy, a debilitating degenerative muscular disease that causes early death.
 We propose an innovative experimental design by advancing a novel “molecular valve” hypothesis. The
hypothesis states that a sophisticated molecular valve at the unique portal vertex controls genome flow into
and out of a virus capsid through dynamic structural and conformational changes.
 By integrating genetics, biochemistry, and cryo-electron microscopy, we will generate a series of
asymmetric reconstructions of nanomachines in different structural and conformational states. These machines
translocate genome into virus capsid creating a pressurized condensate (inward genome flow), arrest genome
flow and position for delivery, and allow genome ejection upon encountering new host (outward genome flow).
 In specific aim 1, we will generate atomic level structures of the DNA packaging machine consisting of
the portal vertex-bound packaging motor and its intermediate states during active translocation. A detailed
packaging mechanism will be formulated that will have broad implications to phages, eukaryotic and archaeal
viruses including herpes and adeno viruses. A strong work-flow has been established for preparation and data
collection of packaging complexes using a newly constructed super-charged “acidic capsid” mutant. In specific
aim 2, we will elucidate the dynamic mechanism of the neck-connector valve complex bound to portal by
generating structures in different assembly states. These structures would illustrate conformational changes in
the valve complex that lead to arrest of genome flow post-packaging and position it for delivery following tail
docking. We present a novel discovery involving the participation of a host nucleic acid binding protein Hfq in
these dynamic transactions. In specific aim 3, we will probe the mechanism of genome ejection by asymmetric
cryo-EM reconstructions of the genome ejection machine pre-infection, during-infection, and post-infection. A
preliminary cryo-EM reconstruction revealed, for the first time, density for a helical tape measure protein-DNA
complex in the innermost core of the ejection tube. In specific aim 4, we will incorporate the basic knowledge
gained from specific aims 1-3 to establish a novel, large capacity, T4 gene therapy vehicle to deliver the full-
length ~11-kb dystrophin gene into human muscle cells as well as into a muscular dystrophy mouse model.
 Relying on our 42-years of expertise on T4 phage assembly and genome packaging, our synergistic
research team will uncover the basic mechanisms of genome flow in viruses and their translation into potentially
transformative phage-based gene therapeutics. These will have broad implications to virology and human
disease therapies."
10814966,"Over 40% of adults are obese in the US. Although reducing caloric intake and/or increasing physical activity can
lead to weight loss in the short to medium term in some people, they lose efficacy in the long term. Bariatric
surgeries are currently the most durable and effective treatment for obesity but substantial complications have
been reported. Pharmaceutical options for treating obesity have been very limited and not efficacious. Anti-
obesity medications generally target either central nervous system (CNS) pathways that regulate sensations of
satiety and fullness, or peripheral modulators of digestion, metabolism and lipogenesis that result in only modest
effects. One of the major challenges in developing anti-obesity medications is that our CNS (i.e., hypothalamus,
brainstem, and limbic system), which regulates appetite and food intake, substantially overlaps with those that
modulate mood, anxiety and behavior. Several CNS-acting drugs that have been developed to suppress appetite
for weight loss have adverse behavioral effects. For example, Rimonabant (endocannabinoid receptor
antagonist) and Ecopipam (dopamine receptor antagonist) precipitate severe depression and suicide ideations;
and the recent FDA-approved MC4R agonist (Setmelanotide) for individuals carrying pathogenic mutations in
POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR genes along the leptin-melanocortin pathway also incurs similar psychiatric effects in
26% patients. All of these highlight safety issues in targeting the CNS for appetite suppression. However, the
recent success of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) agonists (Liraglutide, Semagglutide, Tirzepatide,
etc.) and amylin analogs (Cagrilintide) in treating obesity without apparent CNS-related adverse effects
demonstrates the proof of principle that targeting certain parts of our CNS for weight loss can be safe, i.e.,
targeting specific neural circuits primarily in the brainstem for GLP1R agonists and amylin analogs. It also
indicates that a subset of obesity genes can be safely targeted pharmaceutically in the CNS. There has been
tremendous progress in genetic studies of obesity and adiposity traits in the past 20 years, especially led by our
Genetic Investigation of ANThropometric traits [GIANT] consortium, which has identified >1,700 adiposity loci.
These efforts offer an unprecedented opportunity to identify novel drug targets to treat obesity, a field that
urgently needs a paradigm shift. By leveraging comprehensive GWAS resources for adiposity, psychiatric traits
and addictive risk behaviors, and rich phenome information across large-scale biobanks, we propose to integrate
multi-layers of omics to identify obesity genes using whole-exome sequencing, transcriptome-wide and
proteome-wide association analyses (Aim 1), predict pharmacological effects upon targeting obesity genes using
drug-target Mendelian randomization analyses and gene-based phenome-wide association analyses (Aim 2),
and screen neuronal effects of obesity drug target genes in iPSC-derived neurons with CRISPR-based functional
genomics (Aim 3). Our work will identify novel obesity drug targets that are both efficacious and safe to fill in the
critical unmet need of pharmaceutical therapy of obesity."
10838422,"This proposal aims to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) and conduct a
randomized clinical trial to examine how a voice-assisted remote patient symptom monitoring system
(VARSMS) can be useful in reducing ethnoracial disparities after gastrointestinal (GI) cancer surgery. There
are significant disparities among ethnoracial minorities along the continuum of GI surgical cancer care. Even
after controlling for key factors, Black and Hispanic patients are twice as likely as White patients to experience
operative deaths and complications after GI cancer surgery in part due to poor communication, low health
literacy, understanding or follow-up across a range of factors. Research indicates that disparities in outcomes
for minority surgical patients may be driven by events during the vulnerable phase of surgical transitions when
patients are recovering at home under difficult social and medical conditions. Lack of early recognition or
management of postoperative symptoms can lead to complications and readmissions.
Remote patient symptom monitoring may be a powerful tool to reduce disparities in post-discharge
complications by facilitating patient-friendly connections to the care team. Our pilot test, built on Amazon Alexa
and Echo devices, has shown successful usage of this innovative technology among a sample of mostly
ethnoracial minority patients (70%) to which it was targeted. But large-scale evidence is lacking.
To address this timely gap, we propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial to examine how a voice-assisted
remote patient symptom monitoring system can reduce disparities in GI cancer surgery outcomes within one of
the largest and ethnoracially rich (50% Black) healthcare systems in the Mid-Atlantic region. Our overarching
goal is to increase patient-clinician communication in reporting post-discharge symptoms using an innovative
voice-assisted system to better inform early clinical intervention decisions and thereby reduce readmissions,
complications, and emergency room (ER) visits. Building on the success of a pilot clinical trial that leveraged
voice-assisted remote patient symptom monitoring and the care transition conceptual framework, our
collaborative multidisciplinary team to:
Aim 1: To conduct a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a VARSMS at reducing
the number of adverse events assessed by a composite outcome including in-patient readmissions
and ER visits among GI cancer surgery patients for 40 days post-discharge.
Aim 2: To evaluate the efficacy of VARSMS in improving patient-clinician communication and
adherence during post-discharge care transition after GI cancer surgery for minority patients
compared to White patients.
Aim 3: To evaluate provider’s experience with the VARSMS system during post-discharge care
transition after GI cancer surgery, with special attention to non-White patients."
10862571,"PROJECT SUMMARY
While acute pain is an important biological signal in response to injured tissue, chronic pain occurs when the
pain signaling outlasts the initial injury and has deleterious effects on health and quality of life. Chronic pain
represents an enormous public health burden with few therapeutic options. Chronic pain is distinct from acute
pain with several unique features including long-lasting activation of astrocytes. Astrocytes are CNS cells with
diverse functions including energy homeostasis, regulation of the blood brain barrier, clearance of
neurotransmitters, and regulation of synaptic transmission, all of which are altered in activated states.
Preventing activation of astrocytes represents a key therapeutic target. Microglia, the resident immune cells of
the CNS, have been implicated as key mediators of astrocyte activation. In this way, microglia manipulation
may provide a tool to prevent or alter astrocyte activation, which in turn may prevent pain from becoming
chronic. Previous research from our lab has shown that depletion of microglia at the time of transition from
acute pain to chronic pain prevents chronic pain. However, when microglia are depleted once chronic pain is
established, there are only transient improvements in pain-like behaviors. One explanation for these different
effects is that microglia may be contributing indirectly to chronic pain by triggering astrocyte activation during
the transition to chronic pain. However, once astrocytes are activated, microglia cease to have an active role in
pain signaling and the alterations in spinal cord circuits maintaining chronic pain are due to changes in
astrocyte function. I hypothesize that at the acute-to-chronic transition microglia are necessary and sufficient to
activate astrocytes and that microglia effects in chronic pain are entirely dependent on astrocyte activation. In
Aim 1, I will characterize astrocyte activation in a mouse model of pain-producing peripheral injury after
selective depletion of microglia at the acute-to-chronic pain transition. I will further use DREADDs to
exogenously activate astrocytes at the acute-to-chronic transition to determine if exogenous activation of
astrocytes is sufficient to maintain the transition to chronic pain in the context of microglia depletion. In Aim 2, I
will use exogenous activation of microglia in a naïve mouse to determine if activation of microglia is sufficient to
activate astrocytes and if this activation of astrocytes leads to pain-like behaviors. Finally, in Aim 3 I will
determine which signals from microglia are important for astrocyte activation in the induction of chronic pain
using cell-cell interaction analyses of single nuclei RNA-Sequencing data from astrocytes and microglia. Using
the innovative experiments in this research proposal, I will uncover the relative roles and contributions of
microglia and astrocytes to chronic pain and generate new targets for pain therapeutics. The proposed
research is part of a comprehensive training plan that will provide me with extensive technical knowledge in
cutting-edge technologies and analyses. In addition, the career and scientific goals of this proposal will serve
as the foundation for my future K99/R00 Pathway to Independence award and an academic research career."
10816548,"Project description
Gut epithelium is the principal site in which neural, immune, microbial and dietary
factors interact. This multi-system interaction critically regulates whole-body physiology
including metabolism, immunity, and neurodegenerative diseases. At the basis of this
interaction is the healthy and balanced gut epithelium. As one of largest exposed
surfaces of the body, billions of cells are shed from the human gut epithelium every day.
These lost cells are replenished by intestine stem cells to maintain gut homeostasis and
functions. Deciphering the regulatory mechanisms of gut homeostasis is therefore
important for understanding normal gut functions as well as gastrointestinal disorders
including colorectal cancer. Although genetic programs that control gut homeostasis
have been extensively studied, very little is known about how mechanical forces––
generated by gut peristalsis and food passing could regulate intestine stem cell
behavior. Here, we use the adult Drosophila midgut as a simple but robust system to
dissect how shear stress as a natural force of the gut lumen could regulate gut
homeostasis and gut homeostasis. Our pilot studies have made novel findings that
shear stress activates Ca2+ signals in enteroendocrine cells through the Ca2+ channel
TrpA1. Moreover, disruption of TrpA1 markedly reduced intestine stem cell proliferation.
Based on these exciting results, we hypothesize that: 1) shear stress regulates gut
homeostasis through TrpA1-dependent activation of EEs and subsequent release of
signaling molecules from EEs, 2) shear stress activates TrpA1 by regulation of the
intrinsic property of cell membrane. In this collaborative project, we plan to test these
hypotheses by leveraging the power of Drosophila genetics and combining it with new
mechanobiological analysis and stem cell biology. Because TrpA1 is expressed in
mammalian EEs, and because we find that mammalian TrpA1 is also activated by shear
stress, our proposed studies will likely have a broad impact in gut physiology including
that of mammals."
10860963,"A next-generation extendable simulation environment for affordable, accurate, and efficient free
 energy simulations
 PI: Tai-Sung Lee, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854-8087 USA.
Multi-scale molecular simulations are vital to scientific research, impacting protein and nucleic acid
engineering, biomaterials design, and drug discovery. AMBER, a simulation package with broad academic
and industrial appeal since the 1980s, supports over 30,000 users across the world today. AMBER’s enduring
popularity owes to its pmemd.cuda simulation engine, optimally implemented affordable Graphics Processing
Unit (GPU) platforms. Recently, the implementation was extended with modern free energy methods and
novel sampling algorithms to support a range of scientific applications, chief among them drug discovery by
prediction of protein-ligand binding affinities. A new generation of integrated methods, workflows, and
physical models are emerging, supported by a constellation of simulation software that includes NAMD,
CHARMM, Gromacs, OpenMM, and other programs. With these scientific advances a critical barrier to
progress in the field is the lack of a software package with seamless incorporation of high-performance
MD, free energy estimators, and emerging models. To surmount this barrier and in responding to NIH
Focused Technology Funding Opportunity which calls for innovative, focused technology development of a
working prototype of critical research tools, we propose to develop a next-generation executing environment.
The proposed work will offer fast prototyping, accessibility to new algorithms, further improvements in
single-GPU performance, strong scaling in synchronous and asynchronous ensemble methods, and
interoperability with different types of force fields and physical models. We propose to do the following: 1.
Environment: A Python-based executing environment for integrating various modules, including the
MD engine, the free energy module, and user-workflow control. This essential fabric for linking runtime
objects will create a foundation for connecting the molecular dynamics, model building, and analysis
components, and is ready for future growth of scientific and algorithmic advances. 2. Optimization: New
MD and free energy modules consisting of OOP CPU layers and high performance computing
(HPC) kernels, collectively optimized by runtime managing mechanisms. Tight coupling of the C++
layer and the HPC kernel extensions constitutes a system that optimizes performance on both the host and
HPC device. The goal is a set of efficient, robust, and extensible core simulation modules optimized at both
individual module level and their collectively execution. 3. Application: A suite for automatic deduction
of alchemical graphs. This facility, built in the new Python environment, will muster the new MD engine
and integrated capabilities to showcase their scaling and versatility. It will also serve as an example to
future developers of how to recombine the building blocks for advancing their own science."
10837109,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lipids occupy over half of the dry weight of human brain. Brain cells rely on lipid metabolism to meet energy
needs, perform signaling functions, and regulate membrane integrity and dynamics. Alterations in lipidomic
profiles have been observed in aging brains and in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) and related dementia (ADRD), suggesting that reprogramed lipid metabolic pathways may be involved in
disease pathogenesis. Notably, APOE and other lipid metabolism related genes have been associated with
late-onset AD. Despite these observations, how aberrant metabolism of certain lipid classes mechanistically
contribute to brain cell malfunction remains largely undefined. We sought to identify molecular pathways
pertinent to brain lipid metabolism by utilizing approaches that combine molecular genetics and omics. Our
transcriptomic analysis identified Tweety Homolog 1 (TTYH1) whose expression in human brain highly
correlates with APOE. Such correlation between TTYH1 and APOE is lost in astrocytes of AD patients. Using
human primary astrocyte and Drosophila model, we found that TTYH1 and its fly ortholog are required for
ApoE secretion. Cell biology experiments further suggest that TTYH1 and its ortholog are required for
autophagy and lipid droplet (LD) breakdown in glia. Lipidomic analyses of drosophila brains and human
astrocytes deficient in TTYH1 orthologs revealed altered phospholipid abundances indicative of elevated
cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) activity. These preliminary findings inform our overarching hypothesis that
TTYH1 is essential for a novel pathway connecting glial LD breakdown to lipoprotein secretion. In aim 1, we
will test if cPLA2-activating ceramide metabolites regulates LD breakdown in glia, and define the function of
TTYH1 in this process. Aim 2 will elucidate the mechanism of how TTYH1 regulates lipoprotein secretion in
astrocytes. The significance of TTYH1-mediated lipid mobilization in brain aging and ADRD will be evaluated in
Aim 3. We will assess the functional outcomes of perturbing TTYH1 ortholog in drosophila models of aging and
ADRD. We will also examine the role of glial TTYH1 on neuronal homeostasis using coculture of brain cells
derived from Ttyh1 conditional knockout mice. In summary, the project will integrate molecular genetics and
lipidomics to illuminate a novel lipid metabolic pathway that hinges on TTYH1 in brain aging and ADRD.
Findings from this project will aid in defining whether TTYH1 and its associated molecular players can serve as
therapeutic targets for treating neurodegeneration."

The goal of this Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award is to provide the necessary
training and skills to develop into a physician scientist who successfully runs an independent research program
focused on reproductive immunology. Dr. Kristen Noble is an Instructor in the Division of Neonatology at
Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Her career goal is to study the host response to infection during
pregnancy to develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to improve maternal-fetal health. With the
strong mentorship of Dr. C. Henrique Serezani, Dr. David Aronoff, and a multidisciplinary Faculty Oversight
Committee, Dr. Noble will master skills in systems biology (including next generation sequencing and ultra-high
level multiplex immunofluorescence), modeling of infection during pregnancy, and techniques in reproductive
immunology. Vanderbilt provides a rich environment for scientific discovery and collaboration with unique
career development opportunities, shared resources, and facilities with cutting-edge technology to support
early career physician-scientists on their path to independence.
This proposal tests the central hypothesis that the natural evolution of the immune system during pregnancy
dictates gestation-dependent pregnancy outcomes to Group B Streptococcal (GBS) infection, including
differential maternal and fetal immune responses in the gestational tissues. To test this hypothesis, Aim 1 will
define dynamic genetic programs at the single cell level that are activated in response to GBS infection as a
function of gestational age. The intrauterine gestational tissues have unique and dynamic immune
compositions throughout pregnancy. Therefore, we will also use ultra-high level multiplex immunofluorescence
to provide spatial context to key GBS-induced immune responses. The innate immune system is essential for
the protection against pathogens. The intrauterine niche is uniquely composed of both maternal- and fetal-
derived innate immune cells, including macrophages. Aim 2 will use unique mouse models to define the
differential maternal and fetal macrophage contributions to immunity against GBS and to pregnancy outcomes
after infection. Completion of these aims will close substantial knowledge gaps regarding the dynamic nature of
local intrauterine immunity protecting against bacterial infection during pregnancy. This is critical for the
discovery of early diagnostic indicators of infection of which there are none, and necessary to identify potential
therapeutic mechanisms for decreasing poor pregnancy outcomes after GBS infection."
10830462,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Eating Disorders (EDs) are bound together by their severe health consequences and often intractable course
for affected individuals, which can only be ameliorated through a better understanding of ED etiology. Studies
have typically focused on separate diagnostic categories (e.g., anorexia/bulimia nervosa, binge eating
disorder), despite evidence for genetic and symptom overlap across diagnoses. Further, there is a need to
examine EDs before and during their peak onset in adolescence, given the dynamic neurodevelopmental
changes characterizing this period. This project uses a transdiagnostic and multimodal approach, leveraging
large-scale longitudinal data collection from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study to
prospectively identify genetic, neuroimaging, and behavioral measures that may be predictive of an ED in
adolescence. A sample of adolescent girls being treated for an ED will also be included for clinical
generalizability. Aim 1 (K99 phase) will identify behavioral and neuroimaging-derived correlates of EDs across
both ABCD (ages 11-14) and clinical (ages 13-18) datasets, using sophisticated neuroimaging methods to
parse through potential morphological and microstructural predictors of adolescent EDs. Aim 2 (R00 phase)
will expand its study design to include genomic (polygenic risk for EDs and related conditions) and longitudinal
behavioral and brain imaging data (ages 9 to 17) to inform a predictive model of the emergence of an ED in
adolescence, and the impact of these discovered predictors in a clinical setting (ages 14-19). This project’s
strategic utilization of ABCD Study data holds an unparalleled opportunity to uncover the etiological factors of
an ED across both males and females using prospective longitudinal multi-site data, a research endeavour that
otherwise would be extremely difficult and costly to initiate from scratch. Moreover, the inclusion of a clinical
dataset allows for a rare but much-needed investigation of the generalizability of results from a sub-clinical to
more severely ill patient sample. This project will also apply innovative methodologies, including the integration
of polygenic risk scoring across diverse participants, alongside sophisticated neuroimaging techniques allowing
for quantification of whole-brain microstructural features that may provide additional sensitivity in detecting
predictive factors of an adolescent ED. Dr. Makowski’s proposed training plan, including training in ED
research and machine learning methods, will enhance her existing skillset in psychiatric neuroimaging and
genomics. The chosen mentorship team will add the necessary expertise and support that will facilitate Dr.
Makowski’s transition to an independent research position, including additional training in ED research
(mentor: Dr. Wierenga; collaborators: Dr’s Bischoff-Grethe, Fennema-Notestine), neuroimaging and genomics
integration (co-mentor: Dr. Dale), neurodevelopment (collaborators: Dr’s Jernigan, Rhee) and machine learning
(consultant: Dr. Zou). This award will position Dr. Makowski to successfully complete the aims of this project
and work towards a more complete etiological model of EDs that can help inform future treatment."
10799619,"Women with amputations receive more frequent prosthetics care, but are less satisfied with the fit,
comfort, and appearance of their prostheses than men. These findings are not surprising as most
prosthesis components are not gender-specific and seem to have been designed for men. Components
like prosthetic feet are made from molds, and it is prohibitively expensive for prosthetics companies to
provide a high number and variety of foot shape options.
Recent surveys indicate that women Veterans with leg amputations are unable to wear many of the
types of footwear they desire to wear due to limitations of the prosthetic foot. Women Veterans who
have greater perceived challenges with how their prosthesis affected footwear options also experienced
significantly more body image concerns and participated less in daily activities.
This project will assess the impact of a new prosthesis system including a modular prosthetic ankle that
can be used interchangeably with several 3D-printed feet. The prosthetic feet are customized to fit a
wide range of footwear, including shoes of different heel heights and widths. To change footwear, the
user simply removes the prosthetic ankle from one foot-shoe combination and connects it to another,
without the need for tools or modifications to the prosthetic alignment. This new prosthesis system
dramatically improves footwear options for persons using leg prostheses, enabling potential to increase
body image and community participation for women Veterans with leg amputations.
In this study, women Veterans with amputations will be recruited from a national sample to test the
modular ankle – 3D printed feet system. Informed consent and baseline measures will be collected
remotely. Women will then travel to the Minneapolis VA to be fitted with the novel prosthesis system
and shoes of their choice. Accommodation to the new prosthesis system will take place over several
days in Minneapolis with close clinical supervision. After returning home, women Veterans with
amputations will be followed remotely for a period of 6-months to track their outcomes. The study will
test the hypotheses that improving footwear options with our novel prosthesis will improve body image
and participation in women Veterans with amputations. Qualitative interviewing and photovoice will also
be conducted throughout the study to understand the benefits and barriers to using this new prosthesis
system."

Leptospirosis is a common worldwide zoonosis that disproportionately affects low resource areas. The ability to
readily and accurately discriminate leptospirosis infection from other acute febrile illness (AFI) is challenged by
non-specific clinical features and absence of diagnostic tools for point-of care diagnosis. This P01 program will
investigate pathogen-host interactions and develop new diagnostic tests to improve leptospirosis detection
based on host immune and molecular response patterns to non-severe and severe infection. This work is on a
translational pathway towards the ultimate goal of rapid, low-cost AFI diagnostic platforms appropriate for low
resource settings and deployable at the point-of-care. To achieve the program objectives, the proposed
International Clinical Administrative Core (Clinical Core) will serve a coordinating center function to provide
comprehensive, centralized administrative and clinical support to 3 global field sites in Sri Lanka (Galle),
Nicaragua (Leon), and Tanzania (Moshi), as well as to facilitate interactions between international and domestic
partnering institutions including between the Pasteur Institute (Paris, France) and other program projects. The
Clinical Core comprises an experienced, interdisciplinary team that will leverage already existing administrative
and clinical infrastructure to manage the Core’s 3 specific aims including 1) to establish sharing agreements with
international sites and program projects and provide administrative support for site activities; 2) to establish an
integrated clinical data- and bio-repository resource to support all program projects; and 3) to facilitate
operational activities at international field sites to assure robust study enrollment, collection of specimens and

Aim 1 : Engineer targeted mutants. Targeted gene mutants will be created using well-established methods
developed by the Biology of Spirochetes Unit including allelic exchange, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and
Transcription Activator Like Effectors (TALEs). Genes to be targeted include those encoding leucine-rich
repeat proteins and dinucleotide cyclases for use by the Coburn and Haake groups, respectively.
Aim 2: To perform leptospiral genome sequencing. Leptospiral genome sequencing will be performed on
samples isolated from field sites by the Duke project as well as Leptospira strains representative of the
diversity of the genus from the collection of Picardeau laboratory and on key transposon and targeted mutants.
Sequencing will be performed using short- (Illumina) and long-read (PacBio) technologies. The complete
genomes obtained by PacBio sequencing will be used as accurate references for comparative and
phylogenetic studies and serve for the analysis of the plasmid content and the methylomes in project 2

Aim 3: To perform RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). RNA-stabilized samples to be reverse transcribed and
sequenced will include in vitro cultures and hamster samples from the Picardeau project and murine samples
(blood and subcutaneous tissue) from the Haake project. RNA-Seq will be also performed on in vitro samples
from the Haake project (murine macrophage-Leptospira) and Coburn project (human endothelium-Leptospira).
Aim 4: To perform transposon sequencing (Tn-Seq). Tn-Seq will be performed on samples from the Haake and
Picardeau projects generated with pools of transposon mutants with known transposon insertion sites. Tn-Seq
will be performed by construction of genomic libraries using methods developed by the Haake laboratory

Leptospirosis is a widespread and frequently fatal human health problem that disproportionately impacts
individuals living in low resource settings. Research on phagocyte interactions in leptospirosis is significant
because little is known about leptospiral virulence factors required for survival within phagocytes or the response
of macrophages to leptospires. The proposed studies will involve collaborations between the PI and co-
investigator Fayyaz Sutterwala, who is a leader in studies of inflammasome activation. Two related but non-
interdependent Aims are proposed. Aim 1 is to examine leptospiral-phagocyte interactions in vitro. We will
examine the murine vs human macrophage responses to L. interrogans in terms of type I interferon and
inflammasome responses and determine the pathways involved in their activation. We will examine whether
leptospiral virulence genes account for lower inflammasome activation in murine relative to human macrophages.
We will examine the time course of leptospiral uptake and survival vs killing of leptospiral species and test the
hypothesis that macrophage survival is a property of the pathogenic, but not the saprophytic, species. We will
identify virulence genes required for survival after exposure to macrophages as a result of phagocytic uptake
and examine the leptospiral response to macrophage uptake. Given the finding that LigB plays a role in
macrophage infection, we are interested in examining macrophage uptake and killing of a ligAligB knock down
mutant that lacks expression of LigA and LigB. Dual RNAseq will be performed with bone marrow-derived
macrophages (BMDMs) and L. interrogans including mutants with impaired intracellular survival to identify genes
potentially involved in leptospiral-phagocyte interactions. Aim 2 is to examine leptospiral-phagocyte interactions
in vivo. We will examine the kinetics of local control vs dissemination after subcutaneous challenge of hamsters
vs mice. We will test the hypothesis that L. interrogans survives within phagocytes during infection of the
subcutaneous space, blood, and liver. We will identify virulence genes required for intracellular survival within
phagocytes after subcutaneous challenge. We are particularly interested in defects in in vivo fitness for local
and disseminated infection of our ligAligB knock-down mutant and other virulence gene candidates. We will
screen our transposon mutant library for mutants with fitness defects in the subcutaneous space and for
dissemination. Using mice with defects in type I interferon response involving cGAS/STING and inflammasome
activation involving NLRP3, we will test the hypothesis that these macrophage responses improve local control
and reduce dissemination after subcutaneous challenge."

Leptospira is a highly heterogeneous bacterial genus and leptospires are ubiquitous bacteria found as free-living
saprophytes in environmental water and soil or as pathogens that can cause disseminated infections, from
asymptomatic carriage in rats to lethal acute infection in both humans and animals. Despite recent progress, the
genus Leptospira remains understudied, and little is known about the ability of the pathogen to adapt to the host
and cause disease. During dissemination, pathogens must circumvent host defense mechanisms and adapt to
different forms of stresses. The work proposed in this program project seeks to identify and characterize bacterial
determinants that promote mammalian host adaptation and enable leptospires to establish acute infection. In Aim
1, we will identify bacterial markers of disease severity. Genome sequencing of well-characterized Leptospira
strains from our collection and clinical isolates collected in project 4 (Duke) will reveal new insights on the diversity
of strains and species and their pathogenicity. We will perform the first Leptospira intra-genus large-scale
evolutionary study to identify stepwise ancestral events at different nodes of evolution that have drastic
consequences on the pathogens as we know them today and understand what could have been their contribution
to the ecological niche adaptation and enhanced virulence of some of the pathogenic species. We will particularly
focus our attention on the node of evolution in the pathogenic subclade P1 that separated the species infecting
humans (P1hv) from the species not described as human pathogens (P1lv). The putative virulence factors will be
inactivated in representative strains by targeted mutagenesis or gene silencing, or mutants will be selected from
our library of random transposon mutants. We will collaborate with the Coburn and Haake labs to assess
phenotypes of mutants. We will perform diagnosis for samples collected from project 4 (Duke) and we will provide
technical support for field studies. Our work should also contribute to the identification of new antigens and/or
markers for the development of novel strategies for the diagnosis of this neglected emerging disease. Aim 2 will
characterize the regulation of gene expression in adaptation to the host environment. Successful host colonization
by Leptospira requires sensing and response to face of changing conditions. A Dual RNA-seq approach in the
acute hamster model will reveal the molecular mechanisms of interactions between L. interrogans and its host.
Analysis of the transcriptome of Leptospira strains in vivo and different in vitro conditions will enhance our
knowledge of how the pathogen can adapt to the host environment and the roles played by transcriptional
regulators such as the Peroxide Stress Regulators PerRA and PerRB and non-coding small RNA in global gene
expression. We will also investigate the role of epigenetic modification in global gene regulation and virulence in
Leptospira. This project will increase our understanding of the biology of this life-threatening pathogen to fill out
the many gaps in leptospirosis knowledge with the ultimate goal of identifying the mechanisms by which
pathogenic Leptospira infect and adapt the host."

Leptospirosis is the most widespread zoonotic disease worldwide, and varies in severity from mild illness to
fatal hemorrhagic disease with multiple organ failure. Since endothelial damage and increased vascular
permeability are prominent features of leptospirosis, we focus on identification of L. interrogans adhesins that
mediate attachment to human endothelial cells in culture, identification of endothelial cell receptors to which
the bacteria bind, and on the consequences of Leptospira-endothelial cell interaction on the integrity of the
endothelial layer. Pathogenic L. interrogans crosses endothelial layers (transendothelial migration) efficiently,
while the non-pathogenic L. biflexa does not. The major contributor to endothelial cell-cell adherens junctions
(AJs) and barrier function, VE-cadherin, is a receptor for L. interrogans, and L. interrogans causes disruption of
AJs, while L. biflexa does not. We identified two L. interrogans adhesins that bind to purified VE-cadherin with
high affinity. We will collaborate with the Pasteur and UCLA groups to assess phenotypes of existing
transposon mutant clones, as well as knock-in (gain of function) and knock-down mutants in cell culture and in
animal models to identify and better characterize Leptospira proteins that contribute to invasion of endothelial
barriers. In these experiments we will also generate samples for analyses of 1) bacterial and 2) host gene
expression, and 3) host response biomarker production in a relatively simple cell culture model. Datasets 2 and
3 will be compared to those generated by the Duke group to identify and characterize the responses generated
during human infection. Our hypothesis is that endothelial damage in leptospirosis results from collaboration
between bacterial virulence determinants and endothelial cell responses. Aim 1 will assess human endothelial
cell responses to, invasion dynamics, and in vivo tissue tropism of, diverse Leptospira isolates. Endothelial AJ
integrity and bacterial transendothelial migration will be compared after infection with clinical and
environmental isolates belonging to high-virulence and low-virulence pathogenic species, and saprophytic
species, at various times post-inoculation. Supernatants will be used to quantify cytokines and other potential
biomarkers of Leptospira infection. Cell layers and supernatants will be used for RNA-Seq to identify changes
in host and bacterial gene expression. Statistical analyses of associations between pathogenicity, endothelial
damage, and host responses will identify potential biomarkers as indicators of leptospirosis in patient blood
samples, which could inform improved diagnostics in conjunction with the results obtained by the Duke group.
Aim 2 will determine the roles of known and candidate L. interrogans adhesion proteins in adherence to, and
invasion of, endothelial cell layers. Some of the candidate adhesins of interest include a family of leucine-rich-
repeat (LRR) proteins identified by the Pasteur group, and notably, LRR proteins are over-represented in
highly pathogenic Leptospira genomes. Our work will establish ties between genome content, protein function,
and endothelial responses in endothelial damage in leptospirosis."

United States (US) and direct healthcare costs estimated at $355 billion USD. AD/ADRD currently lacks effec-
tive disease-modifying treatments, though multiple AD/ADRD risk factors have been identified, including midlife
metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components, such as diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidemia. Recent preclini-
cal and clinical research reveals that AD/ADRD and cognitive impairment associated with MetS progress non-
cell autonomously in the brain through a concerted breakdown in oligodendrocyte function with resulting neu-
ronal loss. However, there is a gap in our understanding of how MetS and its associated oligodendrocyte dys-
function leads to cognitive impairment and AD/ADRD. Given the increasing burden of AD/ADRD and MetS,
there is a critical need to identify the mechanisms of oligodendrocyte-neuron metabolic crosstalk and its role in
MetS leading to AD/ADRD. Our proposal will elucidate how midlife MetS onset disrupts oligodendrocyte me-
tabolism and consequent support to neurons, leading to AD/ADRD in later life. Under physiological conditions,
oligodendrocytes metabolically support neurons with lactate shuttled via monocarboxylate transporter 1
(MCT1). This ensures an adequate energy substrate supply to neurons, supporting normal cognitive function.
Two crucial pieces of data are relevant to this proposal. First, the MetS influences epigenetic elements that de-
crease MCT1 expression. Second, AD/ADRD is associated with oligodendrocyte loss, reduced cerebral lac-
tate, and neuronal injury. Our objective therefore is to elucidate the role of oligodendrocyte-neuron metabolic
crosstalk and the lactate shuttle in the MetS leading to AD/ADRD with aging. Our central hypothesis is that
MetS disrupts oligodendrocyte-neuron metabolic crosstalk, impairing the lactate shuttle, leading to loss of met-
abolic support to neurons, ultimately promoting AD/ADRD. We will test our hypothesis by: 1) assessing the ef-
fects of MetS on cognition and oligodendrocytes epigenomics and transcriptomics in middle-aged mice, 2)
evaluating oligodendrocyte-neuron metabolic crosstalk in an in vitro MetS model, and 3) assessing the impact
of targeting the oligodendrocyte lactate shuttle on cognition in middle-aged MetS mice. This study will have a
significant impact by elucidating the contribution of oligodendrocyte metabolic support to neurons, particularly
via the lactate shuttle, in MetS-associated AD/ADRD, and further examine oligodendrocyte MCT1 as a novel
therapeutic target for MetS-associated AD/ADRD. These studies will support our long-term goal of identifying
and implementing novel, translatable interventions for MetS-induced AD/ADRD."

Functional abdominal pain disorders (FAPD) constitute one of the most common pediatric chronic pain
conditions. FAPD is associated with significant disability, school absenteeism and suboptimal treatment
outcomes. Treatment is hampered by an incomplete understanding of contributing factors like sleep
disturbances. Subjective sleep disturbances have been reported in FAPD but the role of sleep architecture and
its relationship to gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms has not been established. Preliminary data by the candidate
has shown decreased slow wave sleep (%NREM3) measured via polysomnography (PSG) in FAPD patients
vs. controls. Percutaneous Electrical Nerve Field Stimulation (PENFS) is an FDA cleared therapy for pediatric
FAPD. Preliminary data indicates that PENFS improves sleep in addition to symptoms of FAPD. However,
there is limited data on factors predicting response, effects on sleep architecture and underlying mechanisms.
The primary aims of this K23 training application are to:
(1) Determine the relationship of sleep architecture (NREM3 and other variables measured via PSG) with
 abdominal pain and other patient-reported outcomes in a case-control study of adolescents with FAPD.
(2) Compare changes in sleep architecture before and after PENFS, associate with patient reported outcomes.
This is the first study to objectively characterize sleep architecture in pediatric FAPD and changes with PENFS.
Comprehensive measures of sleep physiology such as sleep questionnaires, daily diaries and actigraphy will
be employed in addition to PSG to associate with GI measures. The primary objective is for the candidate to
acquire advanced research training through a Master of Science in Clinical and Translational Research, learn
sleep (PSG and actigraphy) and pain assessments, and advanced statistical methods. The long-term goal is to
build an independent research program to study risk factors in pediatric FAPD and identify novel treatment
targets to improve outcomes. The K23 candidate is an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics, and a pediatric
gastroenterologist at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC). This application integrates a
thoughtfully designed research and training plan developed in conjunction with mentors and collaborators who
are leading scientists and clinical experts in pain, GI, sleep and behavioral medicine. CCHMC provides a rich
collaborative research environment and is deeply dedicated to the development of young investigators with
significant institutional funding opportunities, support in developing clinical trials, study monitoring, and
statistical analysis through core resources at the Digestive Health Center, and Clinical Translation Research
Center. This environment will be conducive to the candidate to complete the proposed research and training to
achieve full research independence. Results will build the foundation for a subsequent R01 trial to further
optimize PENFS outcomes and determine the relationship of central pain processing with NREM3 sleep."
10849709,"Background: The US Department of Housing and Urban Development-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing
(HUD-VASH) program offers permanent, subsidized independent housing and case management to over
60,000 Veterans annually. In response to COVID-19, HUD-VASH shifted case management from in-person to
telephone/video interactions. The goal of this project is to examine the effect of HUD-VASH’s shift to virtual
care on Veteran engagement and outcomes in the program. Our proposal is motivated by a working theory that
virtual care increased access to case management, primary care, and improved behavioral quality measures
conducive to phone/video interactions (e.g., follow-up after a psych hospitalization), but decreased access to
specialist care and worsened quality measures not conducive to phone/video interactions (e.g., meds for opioid
use disorder). Significance: The VA is dedicated to improving the housing and health of Veterans. Our project
will advance policy by helping the National Homeless Programs Office understand the impact of virtual care in
HUD-VASH to maximize program reach, engagement, and outcomes. The project addresses VA’s FY 2018-
2024 Strategic Objective 2.2 (“VA ensures at-risk and underserved Veterans receive what they need to
eliminate Veteran suicide, homelessness, and poverty”), objectives of RFA HX-21-025 (changes to virtual care
on Veteran outcomes), and objectives of HSR&D (virtual care and social determinants of health). Specific
Aims: Aim 1. Determine the effect of HUD-VASH’s shift to virtual care during the COVID-19 pandemic on case
management services: Hypothesis: HUD-VASH’s shift to virtual care during the pandemic resulted in more
total, telephone and video case management as compared to a pre-pandemic period. Secondary analysis:
Identify associations between Veteran factors (e.g., mental health diagnosis) with the use of case management
before and after the shift to virtual care, and Veteran factors associated with not engaging in any virtual care.
Aim 2. Evaluate the effect of HUD-VASH’s shift to virtual care during the pandemic on Veteran’s health care
utilization and continuity of care. Hypothesis: HUD-VASH’s shift to virtual care during the pandemic increased
the use of primary care and improved some behavioral quality measures while decreased other behavioral
quality measures not conducive to virtual care and the use of outpatient specialist care. Secondary analysis:
Examine Veteran factors associated with HUD-VASH program exits and utilization of health care in the year
after program exit. Aim 3. Examine Veteran and provider experiences with virtual case management in HUD-
VASH. Semi-structured interviews with VA leadership, case managers, and Veterans who experienced HUD-
VASH’s shift to virtual care, will provide an understanding of the barriers to and facilitators of the
implementation of virtual case management. Methodology: A convergent parallel mixed-methods design will
be used. Data from the VA’s Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) will be linked with Homeless Operations
Management and Evaluation System (HOMES) for analysis. Using these data, Aims 1 and 2 will use an
interrupted time series design with segmented regression to examine utilization outcomes before and after
HUD-VASH’s shift to virtual care. For Aim 3, qualitative interviews with VA leadership, case managers and
Veterans will capture the experience of implementing and receiving virtual care and give context to our
quantitative findings. Next Steps/ Implementation: Our findings will inform the evolution of virtual care within
the HUD-VASH program. This project will also inform the Homeless Programs Office of the impact and
experience of transitioning to virtual care during the pandemic and the extent this transition and pandemic
disrupted VA care of homeless Veterans."
10873734,"Project Summary/Abstract
Prostate Cancer (PCa) is among the most common cancers in men worldwide, with an estimated 1.6M cases and 366K 
deaths annually [1]. In the US, 11% of men are diagnosed with PCa over their lifetime, with incidence generally rising with 
age [2]. The Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) has become a standard tool for diagnosing PCa using 
multi-parametric MR images (mp-MRI). PI-RADS aims to standardize the way to classify the cancer grades. However, PI-RADS does not use clinical and demographic patient information, and MR images are assessed qualitatively or at most 
semi-quantitatively causing under-detection of dangerous cancer and over-detection of insignificant cancer. 
This proposal is to develop artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to improve the detection accuracy by reducing 
assessment variations and providing trustable predictions. Our algorithms will use diverse population data and eventually a 
far better evaluation system. This new system will input mp-MRI, clinical (digital rectal exam, PCa family history), 
demographic (age, race), and laboratory (serum PSA) data to provide risk scores for intraprostatic lesions, and 
improve patient management for diverse populations. The smart system we will develop is called Hybrid Intelligence
and Trustable (HIT)-PIRADS and specific aims of this proposal are three-fold: 
First, we will develop a new pre-processing framework for enhancing mp-MRI data and minimizing data biases. MRI 
quality varies significantly, which makes standardization very difficult. To normalize MRI, we will correct artifacts, remove 
inhomogeneity and noise as the pre-processing step. Next, dataset bias, such as over/under-representation of race will be 
dealt with as biases cause skewed and inaccurate outcomes. We will examine imbalances and quantify uncertainties in data 
representation to develop a visual bias-estimation tool (ViBeT) to identify potential biases in the data. Second, we will 
develop joint segmentation, detection, and classification algorithms for PCa using mp-MRI. Quantification of prostate and 
PCa is essential for lesion identification, risk stratification, biopsy guidance, and lesion targeting for surgery/focal therapies. 
We will use our innovative capsule-based neural networks algorithms and extend its strength to analyze mp-MRI and nonimaging data. This step will improve generalization of our algorithms to all risk groups, races, and ages. There will be also 
an explanation module in the HIT-PIRADAS: we will embed both radiographical interpretations and visual explanations 
into the baseline HIT-PIRADS. Third, we will evaluate and validate the efficacy of the HIT-PIRADS both retrospectively 
and prospectively. We will prove the effectiveness of HIT-PIRADS in over 7000 patients’ data (3846 retrospective, 3200 
prospective). We will rigorously evaluate sources of variations and standardize HIT-PIRADS for adoption in the clinics. 
The outcome of this project will be a first-of-its-kind and easy-to-use recommendation system for PCa detection and 
patient management (HIT-PIRADS) to provide more accurate, unbiased, reproducible results to reduce PCa related 
morbidity and mortality. In the long term, we expect HIT-PIRADS to be widely adopted in clinics and trigger other treatment 
& prevention strategies to be developed based on HIT-PIRADS."
10809717,"Providing smoking cessation treatment in conjunction with the recently expanded lung cancer screening guidelines is estimated to substantially reduce lung cancer deaths and increase life-years gained compared to conducting lung screening alone. Although CMS recommends that individuals undergoing lung screening who currently smoke are offered cessation treatment, there are multiple barriers to treatment delivery. Improving the evidence-base of cessation treatment for patients undergoing lung screening and methods to promote the systematic uptake of cessation treatment into routine practice, particularly among diverse populations, is essential for realizing the maximum benefit of lung screening. Guided by the Practical, Robust, Implementation & Sustainability framework, we will extend our prior work (CA R01207228). We propose a health system-level, pragmatic, randomized trial to compare the effectiveness of two evidence-based cessation treatments, with implementation strategies designed to address barriers to reach and engagement, particularly among underserved groups (e.g., racial and ethnic minority groups, underinsured patients, and patients not ready to quit) who are less likely to receive cessation treatment. To maximize generalizability to other health systems and to improve reach among heterogeneous groups, all patients scheduled at one of the 10 lung screening sites at MedStar Health, the largest and most diverse health system in the Mid-Atlantic, will be identified via the EHR, contacted for enrollment using an opt-out approach, and randomized to: 1) Quitline E-referral (QL-E; N=594) via the EHR and quitline integrated system, including proactive outreach and standard phone-based counseling+ nicotine replacement provided by the quitline vs. 2) MedStar Health System (MHS; N=594), a centralized, phone-based+ NRT intervention adapted and improved from our prior trial, with a randomized stepped care intervention for those who are not abstinent at 3 months. Specific aims are: 1. To compare e-referral to the Quitline vs. the centralized Health System intervention. Primary outcomes are: bioverified abstinence from cigarettes at 3- and 6-months. We will assess intervention mediators (e.g., treatment engagement) and moderators (e.g., readiness to quit) at 6-months. 2. To evaluate reach and engagement overall and by subgroup (e.g., race and ethnicity, underinsured, readiness to quit) and using mixed-methods to understand the contextual factors related to the feasibility and acceptability of the interventions and implementation strategies. 3. To conduct an economic analysis to evaluate costs, average and incremental cost per quit, and budget impact of the intervention at 3- and 6-months from the health system perspective. Proposal strengths include testing the effectiveness and economic outcomes of two cessation interventions while simultaneously laying the groundwork for future implementation within this and other diverse health systems. Our innovative approach capitalizes on the EHR for recruitment, provides multilevel training focused on diverse populations, and accounts for intervention context to inform future care delivery."
10853052,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The central nervous system has an intrinsic pain modulatory system that regulates nociceptive processing
through descending projections from the brainstem to the spinal cord dorsal horn. The ventrolateral
periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) integrates sensory information with input from higher cortical and subcortical
areas, and sends projections to the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) that are relayed to the dorsal horn of
the spinal cord. Both the vlPAG and RVM are heterogenous with respect to participating in multiple behavioral
circuits. The proposed studies build on extensive previous work from the Heinricher laboratory that has defined
the output from the RVM, showing that bidirectional pain control from this region is mediated by two
physiologically defined cell classes, “ON-cells” and “OFF-cells,” that respectively facilitate and inhibit dorsal
horn nociceptive transmission under different conditions. The Ingram laboratory has expertise studying opioid
actions within the PAG and RVM, as well as adaptations in both areas with persistent inflammation. Proposed
viral optogenetic strategies will map and define the vlPAG circuit that regulates RVM ON-cells involved in the
facilitation of pain and elucidate underlying cellular mechanisms that shift the balance of RVM output from
inhibition of pain to facilitation of pain with persistent inflammation. The combined expertise of the two
laboratories will focus on identified PAG-RVM synapses using optogenetic stimulation of RVM terminals
originating from the PAG. In vitro brain-slice recordings (Ingram lab) will examine the heterogeneity of PAG
output to the RVM and PAG-RVM synapses, as well as cellular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity induced in
persistent inflammation. These studies will use a fluorescent label for the μ-opioid receptor to differentiate
presumed ON-cells from other classes in the slice to determine whether PAG terminals directly synapse on
ON-cells, OFF-cells, or both, as well as what neurotransmitters are released. In vivo single-cell recording
studies (Heinricher lab) will determine how inflammation-induced changes in PAG-RVM synapses control
excitability of specific populations of RVM neurons and establish the link between these changes and pain
behaviors. A better understanding of molecular, cellular, and circuit-level mechanisms that underlie pain is
essential if we are to develop better treatments. By carefully mapping the descending projections from PAG to
RVM during the development of persistent inflammation, and by tying these to defined RVM outputs and
behavior, we can begin to determine the interactions in this complex network, and gain new insights into how
pain-modulating systems are recruited and modulated in acute and chronic pain."

The candidate: Dr. Manuel Gomez-Ramirez is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Brain and Cognitive
Sciences (BCS) at the University of Rochester, whose overarching goal is to establish cutting-edge research
program focused on studying neural circuits and spiking dynamics that mediate object sensing and manipulation
with the hands (i.e., haptics). Dr. Gomez-Ramirez completed his Ph.D. at the City College of the City University
of New York studying mechanisms of distracter suppression in humans. He transitioned to studying mechanisms
of tactile perception in non-human primates using multi-electrode single-unit recordings at the Johns Hopkins
University. He conducted a second post-doctoral fellowship at Brown University to learn calcium-based imaging
and optogenetic methods in mice. In his new lab, Dr. Gomez-Ramirez aims to incorporate techniques learned in
his post-doctoral fellowships to study haptics in a non-human primate model.
Research: In this award, Dr. Gomez-Ramirez will study how selective attention controls the sensory gain of
neocortical representations encoding distracter stimuli on the hand. He will use cutting-edge electrophysiological
and neuromodulation methods (i.e., optogenetics) to determine the neural circuit, and its dynamics, that mediate
sensory suppression of distracting tactile inputs. Aim 1 investigates the granularity of attention to modulate
sensory responses via targeting of cells’ receptive field (RF) inhibitory and/or excitatory sub-regions. Aim 2
investigates the precision and flexibility of attention to deploy distracter suppression across different somatotopic
representations in the somatosensory system. Aim 3 tests the role of layer 5 SST neurons in mediating sensory
gain suppression in supragranular layers, the mayor cortical layer of intra- and inter-area communication.
Training, Mentors, Collaborators, and Environment: The major research training goals of this award are to
gain expertise in (1) Cutting-edge population decoding methods (e.g., state-space analytical methods), and (2)
optogenetic stimulation in monkeys to study the how top-down signals regulate local somatosensory cortical
circuits representing relevant vs. irrelevant tactile information. This award will also provide key training in grant
and manuscript writing, personnel management, as well as engagement in extracurricular activities that will
enhance my career and professional development. The K01 scientific mentoring team comprises world-experts
in their respective field of research, and have been role models for mentoring and supporting junior faculty. The
Tenure Oversight team is composed additional senior faculty that will provide another layer of monitoring to
ensure progress in the activities proposed in the tenure plan.
Impact and Significance: Data gathered from studies in this award will inform an R01 application focused on
studying how top-down signals modulate cross-cortical somatosensory circuits mediating object sensing and
manipulation. This award will help provide training on cutting-edge electrophysiological, computational, and
genetic-based optical methods to personnel in the Dr. Gomez-Ramirez’s lab."
10904798,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Asthma, pneumonia, and bronchiolitis are the top causes of childhood hospitalization in the US, leading to over
350,000 hospitalizations and ≈$2 billion in costs annually. Poor guideline adoption by clinicians
contributes to poor health outcomes for children hospitalized with these respiratory illnesses, including
longer recovery time/hospital stay, higher rates of transfer to intensive care units, and increased risk of hospital
readmission. General hospitals, such as community hospitals, primarily provide care for adults but also provide
care for >70% of hospitalized children nationally. Unlike dedicated children's hospitals, community hospitals
face unique challenges to achieving guideline adoption and high-quality care for children, including less access
to pediatric services and limited resources for pediatric care and quality improvement. Pathways have been
shown to improve clinicians' adoption of evidence-based practices/guidelines and health outcomes for children
in community hospitals. Pathways are simple, visual diagrams that guide clinicians step-by-step through the
evidence-based care of a specific medical condition (accessed via paper or electronically). Most hospitals
implement pathways for a single medical condition at a time, but Seattle Children's Hospital developed an
intervention for simultaneously implementing multiple pathways for multiple pediatric conditions. This
intervention improved guideline adoption, decreased length of stay, and decreased costs; and these results
were sustained. This multi-condition pathway intervention has not yet been studied in community
hospitals, which face unique implementation barriers. Our objective is to identify and test pragmatic and
sustainable strategies for implementing the multi-condition pathway intervention for children hospitalized with
asthma, pneumonia, or bronchiolitis in community hospitals. In Aim 1 (R61), we will engage stakeholders from
community hospitals in identifying barriers and facilitators of implementation and in refining the intervention. In
Aim 2a (R33), we will conduct a pragmatic, cluster-randomized trial in 36 community hospitals (1:1
randomization to intervention vs. wait-list control) to determine the effects of the multi-condition pathway
intervention. Our primary outcome will be adoption of 2 evidence-based practices for each condition over a
sustained period of 2 years. We will also determine length of stay, ICU transfer, and readmission. During
implementation, we will also measure fidelity (use of implementation strategies as intended) in hospitals
receiving the intervention (n=18). In Aim 2b (R33), we will use multi-level models to determine if these
strategies are associated with guideline adoption (measured in Aim 2a). Our expected outcomes will be a
comprehensive understanding of how to pragmatically, sustainably implement the multi-condition pathway
intervention in community hospitals and an assessment of its effects. These outcomes will have an important
positive impact by providing evidence on an intervention that can leverage implementation resources by
tackling multiple pathways and rapidly improve care and outcomes for children with respiratory illnesses."

Despite progress in prevention and treatment by sanitation, antimicrobials, vaccines, and other
measures, infectious diseases still threaten life and health. In 2016, communicable diseases
accounted for over 17% of disability-adjusted life years lost worldwide. With globalization,
infectious disease threats (previously seen as being limited to less-developed countries) threaten
everyone (like Ebola, HIV, MERS, pandemic influenza, and growing resistance to antimicrobial
drugs). The combination of computational power and “Big Data” provides a new opportunity to
study infectious diseases and their transmission through novel approaches, necessitating new
sophistication in the training of infectious disease epidemiologists. We recognize the need for a
corps of academic and government epidemiologists, equipped to deploy sophisticated
approaches to causal inference, transmission-dynamic modeling, model fitting using MCMC and
other Bayesian techniques, population genomics, phylogenetics, and other novel techniques.
 The goal of Harvard Chan School of Public Health’s (HSPH) Interdisciplinary Program in
Infectious Disease Epidemiology (IPIDE) is to train graduates who can apply these diverse tools
to meet the infectious disease threats of a new generation. Our training faculty includes leading
practitioners of all of these techniques and our recent graduates are emerging with deep training,
research experience, and publications in many of these areas. The training program includes
coursework in epidemiology, drug resistance, and mathematical modeling of disease from IPIDE
under the close supervision of our 25 faculty mentors, leading either to a DSc or a PhD. A
tremendously successful postdoctoral training program has to date relied on research funding.
 Harvard’s IPIDE has been running successfully for 20 years, and this training grant has
helped develop not only a new cadre of students with the capacity to monitor, prevent, and
suppress diverse emerging infectious diseases but has also allowed IPIDE to expand its faculty,
funding, diversity of research, and, the number of students who join the infectious disease
epidemiology program. Over the past ten years, 23 trainees have been supported, 18 graduated,
and they published 581 peer-reviewed manuscripts (177 first author publications). For the current
submission, we propose to support 5 pre-doc and 2 post-doctoral trainees each year over the
next five-year project period. Adding these postdoctoral positions will realize synergies and
collaborative opportunities between pre- and postdoctoral fellows and create the opportunity to
build new means of integrating postdocs into the highly interdisciplinary training environment."

Advance care planning and palliative care represent evidence-based, high-quality care for patients with
advanced cancer. Early identification of patients at risk of short-term mortality is a promising strategy to
increase advance care planning and palliative care. However, this is limited by prognostic inaccuracy among
oncology clinicians, who overestimate prognosis for 70% of their patients with advanced cancer. While recent
advances in electronic health record (EHR) infrastructure and machine learning (ML) have allowed accurate
identification of patient' mortality risk, there is a fundamental gap in understanding how to integrate ML
prognostic algorithms alongside clinician intuition (“human-machine collaborations”) in the routine care of
patients with cancer. Dr. Parikh's research objective is to develop and test human-machine collaborative
systems that leverage ML algorithms to improve clinicians' prognostic accuracy in order to prompt earlier
advance care planning and palliative care among patients with advanced cancer. In prior work, Dr. Parikh has
prospectively validated and embedded into the EHR an automated ML algorithm to predict short-term mortality
risk among patients with cancer. In this application, Dr. Parikh proposes to take a fundamental next step in this
work by exploring strategies to improve prognostic accuracy and decision-making among oncologists treating
patients with advanced cancer. In Aim 1, Dr. Parikh will retrain and validate the existing ML mortality risk

The COVID-19 pandemic catapulted long-standing racial/ethnic health inequities onto the national stage.
Hospitalization and mortality rates for Black and Hispanic individuals with COVID-19 have been 2-3x higher than
the rates of their White counterparts, drawing attention to the patient and system level factors underlying these
differences, including the quality of hospitals to which minority patients are admitted. Of these studies, few have
been able to identify the specific features of hospitals that explain the observed racial/ethnic differences in
outcomes. Our study focuses on differences in nursing resources across hospitals, an important factor that has
not been adequately addressed in the COVID-19 disparities literature. In this mixed methods proposal, we
leverage administrative claims and unique survey data collected from over 22,000 nurses working in 244 New
York and Illinois hospitals during the COVID pandemic (April-June 2021). We employ tapered multivariate
matching, a novel approach which allows us to carefully control for differences in clinical risk and social factors
between minority and white patients to clearly identify the basis of COVID-19 outcome disparities. Our primary
objective is to examine how variations in nursing resources were associated with disparities in minority COVID-
19 outcomes, including mortality and readmissions. A second objective is to identify the nursing and hospital
characteristics of “high performing” hospitals where such disparities were minimized. After identifying high and
low performing hospitals, we will explore the open-ended responses of thousands of nurses who shared their
perspectives of supports and barriers to care delivery for socially “vulnerable” populations, including racial and
ethnic minorities. By examining patient, community, nurse and system-level factors, we seek to uncover whether
there are particular combinations of nursing resources, organizational supports and care processes that are most
effective in reducing COVID-19 disparities. If our study hypotheses are supported and we can identify
characteristics of high performers, it will 1) strengthen the evidence regarding the link between nursing resources
and equitable outcomes, and 2) provide a necessary composite and a set of best practices that can be shared
with other hospitals. Our proposal is well-aligned with multiple goals of NINR, including dismantling structures
that impede health equity, using lessons learned about health disparities from the COVID-19 pandemic and
identifying upstream factors that influence health disparities. Collectively, the results of this study will provide the
foundation for the next phase of our research, which includes the development of innovative models of care
delivery that integrate evidence-based nursing resources and best practices that are associated with equitable
outcomes."
10809685,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Cells perceive mechanical cues in their local environments, which must be converted into intracellular
biochemical signals to modulate cellular physiology and control gene expression. There is increasing
appreciation for mechanical signal transduction’s (“mechanotransduction”) critical role in development and its
dysfunction in disease states such as cancer. However, in contrast to canonical signal transduction, cellular force
sensing is poorly understood, hampering efforts to define mechanistically distinct mechanotransduction
pathways, delineate their specific biological functions, and target them therapeutically.
 The actin cytoskeleton, a network of dynamic actin filaments, myosin motor proteins, and hundreds of
associated factors, enables cells to mechanically interface with their surroundings. The cytoskeleton is classically
understood to serve as a force generation and transmission apparatus that indirectly facilitates mechano-
transduction through its physical linkages to membrane-anchored sites which mediate force signal conversion
(e.g. cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions). However, we and others have recently reported direct binding of soluble
cytosolic proteins containing tandem arrays of LIM (LIN-11, Isl-1 & Mec-3) domains to tensed actin filaments,
suggesting that the cytoskeleton itself may have the capacity to transduce forces into biochemical signals. Here
I propose to test the hypothesis that force-activated actin binding by distinct LIM proteins is upstream of
functionally discrete downstream mechanotransduction pathways. Through cellular assays and biophysical
reconstitution, we will investigate how the representative force-activated actin binding LIM proteins zyxin (Aim 1)
and FHL1/2 (Four-and-a-Half LIM domains 1/2, Aim 2) mediate distinct downstream functions in cytoplasmic
cytoskeletal damage repair and nuclear gene expression regulation, respectively. We will then innovatively
interface these approaches with cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to visualize force-activated actin binding by
LIM proteins in structural detail (Aim 3). Our studies will establish how a conserved mechanism of force
transduction through LIM domains is linked to distinct downstream signaling outcomes, which is likely to reveal
general principles underlying the modular organization of cytoskeletal mechanical signaling networks. In the
longer term, this work will enable precision dissection of context-specific biological functions of LIM proteins in
vivo, facilitating rigorous evaluation of their potential as therapeutic targets."
10909187,"This competing renewal application seeks to conclude a consecutive series of four separately funded

childhood to young adulthood. Our longitudinal developmental data, reflecting multiple domains of functioning,
can yield actionable information about which risk and protective variables/domains best predict clinical and
functional outcomes of juvenile-onset depression (JOD), which is a particularly severe depression phenotype.
Our AIM 1 is to deposit in the National Data Archives (NDA) the data from the first three studies, which will
complement the mandated archiving of data from the most recent (fourth) project. Thereby, these unique data
will be accessible to future analyses by other researchers. Because commonly used modelling approaches
cannot accommodate our questions and the complexity and size of our data base, our AIM 2 is to demonstrate
the novel application of two approaches from the machine learning toolbox (probabilistic graphical models and
ensemble learning methods) to predict JOD outcomes. To enable researchers to fully utilize the data that will
be deposited in the NDA, we will release the Python code packages we develop for AIM 2 as well as the code
for downloading and properly organizing the related information.

when participants were in their mid-20’s to early 30’s, included 308 probands, 229 siblings of probands, and
160 controls. (The reduced sample sizes, compared to prior ones, were due to funding limits). Across the four
projects, close to 1,100 individuals had two or more assessments covering a large array of domains and
variables: key constructs were assessed repeatedly and in multiple ways. To implement AIM 1, our longitudinal
data will be harmonized with NDA structures and definitions and then deposited. To implement AIM 2,
developmentally-framed hypotheses will guide the novel application of machine-learning approaches to JOD
outcomes under two scenarios: for outcomes with a variety of well-known predictors (e.g., recurrent
depression) but scant information about the interrelationships among them and about which are “genuine”
predictors, we will implement probabilistic graphical models; for outcomes the predictors of which are not well
established and/or are supported by equivocal information (e.g., emotion regulation competence in daily life),
we will use ensemble learning methods. The new knowledge we will generate about JOD will have conceptual
implications, will inform efforts to prevent, or mitigate, negative outcomes of JOD, and demonstrate and enable
new ways to fully utilize extensive longitudinal/developmental data sets."
10808954,"Role of epithelial barrier function in food-induced anaphylaxis
ABSTRACT
Food allergy is a growing public health problem with approximately 15 million people affected in
the United States. In allergic food disease, IgE on mast cells bind to ingested antigens leading to
the activation and degranulation of mast cells. In order to activate mast cells, food antigens must
pass through the intestinal epithelial barrier and activate cells in the lamina propria. Junction
Adhesion Molecule-A (JAM-A) is a tight junction transmembrane protein that plays a major role in
the maintenance of barrier function in epithelia and endothelia. In the small intestine, JAM-A has
been shown to be important in epithelial barrier function, and mice that lack JAM-A (JAM-A-/-)
have increased intestinal permeability. These JAM-A-/- mice develop severe food allergic disease
compared to WT animals and have increased mast cells in the lamina propria of the small
intestine, as well as increased activation of these cells. In this proposal, we aim to better
understand the role of JAM-A in the development of severe food allergy, including the induction
of a strong Th2 response that results in mast cell accumulation in the small intestine. We further
plan to target those mast cells in susceptible animals with the aim of decreasing the allergic
response. To do this, we will neutralize stem cell factor (SCF), a cytokine that is required for the
growth and activation of peripheral tissue mast cells. We hypothesize that neutralizing SCF will
prevent mast cell accumulation and protect from severe anaphylactic reactions. These
experiments will contribute to our understanding of barrier function in food allergic reactions, as
well as provide a potential method for decreasing these reactions in the presence of a
dysregulated barrier."
10877780,"Project Summary/Abstract
Neurodevelopmental processes are shaped by dynamic interactions between genes and environments.
Maladaptive experiences early in life can alter developmental trajectories, leading to harmful and enduring
developmental sequelae. Pre- and postnatal hazards include maternal substance exposure, toxicant exposures
in pregnancy and early life, maternal health conditions, parental psychopathology, maltreatment, structural
racism, and excessive stress. To elucidate how various environmental hazards impact child development, it is
imperative that a normative template of developmental trajectories over the first 10 years of life be established
based on a sufficiently large and demographically diverse sample of the US population. To accomplish this, the
Healthy Brain and Child Development National Consortium (HBCD-NC) has been formed to deploy a
harmonized, optimized, and innovative set of neuroimaging (MRI, EEG) measures complemented by an
extensive battery of behavioral, physiological, and psychological tools, and biospecimens to understand
neurodevelopmental trajectories in a sample of 7,500 mothers and infants enrolled at 24 sites across the United
States (US). The HBCD-NC will carry out a common research protocol under direction of the HBCD-NC
Administrative Core (HCAC) and will assemble and distribute a comprehensive and well-curated research
dataset to the scientific community at large under the direction of the HBCD-NC Data Coordinating Center
(HDCC). The overarching goal of the HBCD-NC is to create a comprehensive, harmonized, and high-
dimensional dataset that will characterize typical neurodevelopmental trajectories in US children and that will
assess how biological and environmental exposures affect those trajectories. A special emphasis will be placed
on understanding the impact of pre- and postnatal exposure to opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco, and/or other
substances. To address these broad objectives, the sample of women enrolled will include: 1) a racially,
ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse cohort that is representative of the US population; 2) pregnant woman
with use of targeted substances (opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco); and 3) demographically and behaviorally
similar women without substance use in pregnancy to enable valid causal inferences. In addition, the HBCD-NC
will identify key developmental windows during which both harmful and protective environments have the most
influence on later neurodevelopmental outcomes. The large, multi-modal, longitudinal, and generalizable dataset
that will be produced for the first time by this study will provide novel insights into child development using state-
of-the-art methods. The HBCD-NC study will inform public policy to improve the health and development of
children across the nation."
10933534,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability across all ages. Secondary injury
mechanisms of phospholipid (PL) peroxidation and cell death are implied in the expansion of the damage
caused by the primary insult. We discovered that a required step in necrotic cell death, ferroptosis, triggered
by TBI is peroxidation of arachidonoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (A-PE) catalyzed by enzymatic complex of
15-lipoxygenase (15LOX) with PE-binding protein (PEBP1). We also showed that acyl-CoA synthetase
long-chain 4 (ACSL4), responsible for A-PE synthesis, is an essential positive ferroptosis regulator.
However, two questions: 1) Which cell types undergo PE oxidation in ferroptosis, and 2) Why ferroptosis
sensitivity depends on ACSL4 given high content of A-PE in the brain – remain unanswered due to lack of
subcellular-resolution imaging of diversified lipids in different cell types. To address question 1, we
developed innovative dual- secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) imaging workflow whereby imaging
with water gas cluster ion beams ((H2O)n-GCIB)-SIMS was combined with labeling of proteins by lanthanide
conjugated antibodies (up to ~40). This allowed subcellular mapping on the same tissue section of
individual PLs, including oxidized PLs (PLox) with ~100-1,000 times higher sensitivity and lateral resolution
~1µm and identificiation of cell types undergoing lipid peroxidation. To address question 2, we developed
liquid chromatography-MS-based redox lipidomics approaches to quantitate minor lipid peroxidation
substrates not only during the progression of ferroptosis but also at its initiation. We found that initiation
occurs via peroxidation of a minor oxidizable di-Arachidonoyl-PE (di-A-PE) which has arachidonoyl residues
in both sn-1 and sn-2 positions. Preliminary data show that 15LOX alone readily oxidizes di-A-PE, leading
to ferroptosis initiation. Normally di-A-PE is utilized for synthesis of endocannabinoids, particularly
arachidonoyl-amide (anandamide). This pathway utilizes sn-1 acyl of di-A-PE to enzymatically transacylate
the amino group of another PE, yielding N-acyl-PE (NAPE). In the context of ferroptosis, the N-transacylation
is a strong competitor of di-A-PE oxidation by 15-LOX. Thus, di-AA-PE synthesis, requiring ACSL4, might be
a ferroptosis bottleneck. Our central hypotheses are: i) TBI-induced ferroptosis is a two-stage process
initiated by di-A-PE peroxidation followed by the propagation stage where mono-A-PE species get oxidized
at a lower rate; ii) di-A-PE formation is decisive factor in sensitivity to ferroptosis vs NAPE /anandamide
formation after TBI. Our specific aims include: 1. Optimize SIMS imaging protocols for molecular
characterization of PLox and their substrates in different cell types in normal and injured brains. 2. Determine
the role of ACSL4 and NAPEs in molecular specificity of lipid peroxidation in different cell types of injured
brain. 3. Utilize single cell SIMS imaging to evaluate the effectiveness of novel mechanism based selective
ferroptosis inhibitors: 1) bis-allylic deuterated arachidonic acid, and 2) inhibitor of 15LOX/PEBP1 complex."
10827999,"Prions are the causative agents of a group of transmissible degenerative brain diseases that are fatal to humans
and animals. The properties of the infectious agent and its mechanism of replication are unique. Prions are
comprised of PrPSc, an abnormally folded, aggregated version of its host-encoded counterpart protein (PrPC);
PrPSc self-replicates in the absence of informational nucleic acids by imposing its infectious conformation on
PrPC. Our poor understanding of the structural properties of PrPSc represents an important knowledge gap in
prion biology. This information is critical to elucidate the detailed mechanism of prion replication, the molecular
basis of prion strain variation, and the factors controlling prion transmission between species. In this project, we
focus on ascertaining the structural properties of prions causing chronic wasting disease (CWD), an
uncontrollable, contagious epidemic of North American deer, elk, and other members of the cervid family, which
is also emergent in Asian and European countries. The significant zoonotic potential and emergence of novel
strains have established CWD as a significant public health concern. The specific objectives of our research are
therefore (i) To determine structural properties of North American elk and deer CWD prions; (ii) To determine
the effects of primary structural variation at prion protein residue 226 and route of transmission on CWD prion
strain properties; and (iii) To determine the structural basis of strain variation in emerging Scandinavian CWD
strains and an adapted derivative. Our proposed studies are truly interdisciplinary since they combine the
complementary resources of two laboratories with expertise in novel mouse models for studying CWD, cell
culture approaches, biochemical assays, and a host of state-of-the-art methods of structural biology. The later
include several complementary mass spectrometry-based structural methods and cryo-electron microscopy, an
emerging approach with high potential for providing long-sought insights into high-resolution structures of
different prion strains."

(3 PhD and 3 MD) per year in lung biology research, in the only T32 providing lung science training at Boston
University. Our overarching goals are: 1) To train the next generation of PhD and MD scientists in 3 scientific
foci (SFGs) that are special strengths at BU: lung Development & Regenerative Medicine, lung Infection &
Immunity, and lung Biomedical Data Sciences; 2) To use multidisciplinary approaches (including these SFGs)
to enhance the training environment, enrich the learning experiences of trainees, and better prepare our
graduates for careers in lung science; and 3) To imbue in our trainees, in particular women and those from
under-represented groups (URGs), the importance and excitement of discovery and creation of new
knowledge that will improve the lung health of all populations, especially the at-risk populations we serve,
through didactic and highly interactive courses and seminars. These 3 goals encompass all of the 6 NHLBI
strategic trainings guidelines. We will provide exemplary training by exceptional faculty mentors from 7
departments across 3 schools in order to establish expertise in 11 discipline-specific core competencies that
we have designed in lung biology broadly, and specifically in the areas of regenerative and reparative
medicine, “omics”/computational biology, immunology/infectious diseases, and population studies including
comparative effectiveness and outcomes research. The Boston University environment is ideal for recruiting,
advancing, and retaining URG trainees from diverse backgrounds, as evidenced by its 145 year history of
training URG scholars and our successful T32 track record. Our T32 faculty have designed unique trainings in
the responsible conduct of research and created new programs for recruitment and retention of scientists from
URGs that have been adopted school-wide. The keystone principle of our training program is bi-directional
translation of ideas between basic and clinical spheres. This is why we train MD fellows together with PhD
post-doctoral fellows, MD/PhD students, and PhD students in a unified program which includes a unique
weekly Combined Clinical and Research (CCR) conference where all our basic researchers, physician
scientists, educators, and clinicians interact. Our current program plan represents the very best we have
offered in over 45 years of training exceptional lung researchers and international pulmonary medicine
thought-leaders, including numerous Deans, Department or Division Chairs, Center Directors, and Industry
leaders, on track to produce the next generation of trail-blazers in multidisciplinary lung science."
10833689,"ABSTRACT
Most women diagnosed with ovarian cancer are treated with many rounds of chemotherapy and
often years of a an oral PARP inhibitor drug for “maintenance” therapy. These therapies have
extended life for women with metastatic ovarian cancer, but at the cost of increased toxicity.
One long term toxicity is the development of leukemia or other blood disorders, often called
therapy related myeloid neoplasia (TMN). These secondary malignancies are a known risk of
chemotherapy, and ovarian cancer survivors have one of the highest rates of TMN of any group
of cancer survivors. The diagnosis of TMN is usually fatal, with survival measured in months.
TMN is nearly always detectable in a pre-malignant state as a clonal expansion of blood cells
years before a clinical diagnosis. Non-malignant clonal expansion of white blood cells is often
termed clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). The interval between CHIP and
development of blood cancers is many years, providing an opportunity to better understand the
natural progression of TMN and perhaps a window for intervention and prevention. Clonal
hematopoiesis (CH) can also arise during normal aging, but only a small fraction progress to a
blood cancer. A better understanding of the natural progression of CH in ovarian cancer
survivors is needed to tailor safe and effective ovarian cancer therapies. Our team is co-led by
experts in ovarian cancer genetics and hematological malignancies and will enroll 2000
survivors across the country with ovarian cancer, including 200 with CH. We will follow these
individuals with CH with serial blood draws obtained every 6 months for at least 3 years to
define risk factors for progression of CH to TMN. For a subset of patients with acquisition of
TMN during the study, we will evaluate clonal dynamics and genetic and chromosomal
alterations over time at the single cell level, which will provide novel data on the changes that
occur in the malignant transformation of myeloid cells in response to cytotoxic therapy. In this
way, we will learn who is at risk of TMN and develop strategies for the monitoring and
prevention of this deadly long-term treatment toxicity. These studies will improve outcomes for
patients with ovarian cancer and also will be applicable to survivors or many cancer types, who
are also at risk for TMN."

10764936,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Gram- Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (Sm) is an emergent, multi-drug resistant pathogen. Sm infection occurs
throughout the body but is most often manifest as pneumonia. Sm is notable in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients,
often heightening risk of lung exacerbations, and its significance is increased further by recent reports of Sm
infecting COVID-19 patients. Despite this clinical importance, knowledge of Sm is still relatively limited.
Recently, we found that Sm encodes a type IV secretion system (T4SS) that promotes, in a contact-dependent
manner, apoptosis of macrophages, while blunting apoptosis in lung epithelial cells. Yet, perhaps even more
significant was our finding that the Sm T4SS mediates, in contact-dependent fashion, killing of E. coli (Ec) and
multiple clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa), including those from CF patients. Thus, we posited
that the antibacterial effect of Sm T4SS impacts human infection, as Sm and Pa are often together in water
systems in hospitals and in various types of infections, especially in the (CF) lungs. Based on the analysis of
mutants and their complements, we identified two putative effectors (TfcA and TfcB) as being required for the
bactericidal activity of the Sm T4SS. A mutant lacking both these proteins was as impaired as a mutant lacking
the T4SS apparatus, indicating that TfcA and TfcB account for (nearly all) the killing effects seen. Using both a
2-hybrid assay that measures binding to the T4SS coupling protein and an interbacterial protein translocation
assay, we determined that TfcA and TfcB are bona fide substrates of the T4SS, a result confirmed by testing
mutants lacking both the T4SS apparatus and the individual effectors. Delivery of cloned TfcA (alone) into the
periplasm resulted in the killing of target bacteria, indicating that this effector is both necessary and sufficient
for bactericidal activity. Bioinformatics suggested that TfcA is representative of a large but uncharacterized
branch of microbial lipases, whereas TfcB appears to signify a large but ill-defined group of lysozyme-like
enzymes. In contrast to the vast data re T4SSs impacting mammalian hosts and the many studies on the
antibacterial role of type VI secretion systems, knowledge of the antibacterial role of T4SSs is very minimal.
Indeed, Sm T4SS is thus far the only antibacterial T4SS reported for a human pathogen, and TfcA and TfcB its
only documented bactericidal effectors. Thus, we propose to i) define the enzyme activities encoded by TfcA
and TfcB, ii) discern if those activities promote killing of Pa and Ec, and iii) explore if Sm T4SS, TfcA, and TfcB
also kill other co-inhabitants of the CF lung, ranging from other emerging Gram- bacteria to classic Gram+
pathogens to fungi. Besides improving our knowledge of Sm, the data obtained will have broad implications for
the roles of other T4SSs and possible new links between T4SS effectors and anti-microbial therapies."

 Lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer or questioning, and those youth with other sexual minority identities
(LGBQ+) report riskier alcohol use patterns than their heterosexual peers. This raises concerns that—like
patterns found in the general population—early, risky alcohol use may strongly predict later alcohol problems
and related deleterious health consequences (e.g., other substance abuse, victimization, poor physical and
mental health) that contribute to health disparities among sexual minority adults. The harmful effects of peer
victimization (PV; i.e. bullying and sexual harassment) on adolescent psychosocial functioning may be one
pathway through which LGBQ+ youth become involved in high-risk alcohol use. In adolescence, heterosexist
social norms are strongly enforced through bullying and homophobic sexual harassment. Alarmingly high
numbers of LGBQ+ youth experience homophobic peer aggression. Such experiences can lead to internalized
heterosexism and sexual minority stress. Sexual minority stress has been strongly associated with increased
alcohol use across the lifespan in sexual minority populations. Cross-sectional studies have shown that PV is
positively associated with alcohol and other substance use among LGBQ+ adolescents. However, the
mechanisms through which PV contributes to negative outcomes and the protective factors that ameliorate
those outcomes among LGBTQ+ youth are not well understood. Advances in understanding the effects of PV
on LGBQ+ adolescents have been hampered by a dearth of longitudinal and mixed methods studies that
include these youth in their samples. Using a mixed methods design, the proposed study will investigate the
acute daily and longitudinal effects of PV on LGBQ+ adolescent risky alcohol use, as well as identify potential
buffers and risk factors for these outcomes. Data from 500 adolescents (ages 15-17 years, 50% female gender
identity, diverse racial composition) will be collected using four longitudinal surveys (baseline, 6-, 12, and 18-
month follow-ups), two bursts of daily reports (4-weeks each), and qualitative interviews. Informed by sexual
minority stress and psychological mediation theories, the proposed study aims to: (1) identify the psychosocial
mechanisms linking PV with alcohol and other substance use among LGBQ+ youth; (2) understand the daily
associations between PV and alcohol and substance use; and (3) examine the contexts in which LGBQ+ youth
experience PV and gain insight into the psychosocial factors related to PV and substance use. The proposed
study utilizes a novel integrative conceptual model that incorporates extant knowledge from research on PV
and substance use conducted with heterosexual youth along with factors identified in the LGBQ+ literature,
including sexual minority stress and the psychological mediation framework, to clarify the processes implicated
in substance use by LGBQ+ youth. Results from this study are critically needed to understand the pathways,
processes and contexts through which LGBQ+ adolescents become involved in high-risk alcohol use to inform
the development of primary prevention programs that improve and preserve the health of LGBQ+ youth."
10893416,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 4
Each year ~1.5 million American women enter into the perimenopause, a neuroendocrine transition state unique
to the female. The mission of the Perimenopause in Brain Aging and Alzheimer’s disease (P3) is to discover
biological transformations in brain that occur during the perimenopausal transition that lead to endophenotypes
predictive of risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Herein, we focus on the neuro-immune system as a key driver of
chronological and endocrinological aging that occurs in the midlife female brain. Our goals are to identify the
mechanisms by which these transformations occur and to translate these discoveries into strategies to prevent
conversion to an at-Alzheimer's-risk phenotype. Project 4 contributes to meeting P3 goals by identifying changes
in and connections between biological transformations in brain and peripheral immune activation across midlife
chronological and endocrine aging in a cohort of women, including natural and surgical menopause. The overall
hypothesis guiding Project 4 program of research is that the immune system is the initiator and driver of the
metabolic crisis in brain. Based on our preliminary evidence, we anticipate that the biomarker signature in brain
will be dynamic, and endocrine aging stage dependent. We additionally anticipate that inflammation exacerbates
the impact of metabolic dysregulation on brain biomarker changes. Further, we hypothesize that APOE genotype
will be a key regulator of the biomarker abnormalities related to endocrine changes in brain. The objective of Aim
1 is to determine the dynamic at-risk for AD biomarker signature that emerges during the menopausal mid-life
endocrine transition. The goal of Aim 2 is to identify predictive peripheral inflammatory markers for 1) AD
biomarker progression and 2) menopause symptom severity. The objective of Aim 3 is to identify the links
between surgical menopause and increased AD risk. The goal of Aim 4 is to identify the link between APOE-4
genotype and progression of AD-endophenotype. These objectives will be achieved using longitudinal brain
imaging, immunophenotyping, metabolomics, and clinical evaluation in women of known APOE genotype during
the midlife transition from pre- to peri- to menopause, including surgical menopause. Outcomes of these
analyses will enable us to identify and track development of early sex-specific AD endophenotypes in currently
asymptomatic women while they progress through the midlife endocrine transition.

 Our overarching goal is to evaluate the therapeutic potential and mechanism-of-action of the epigenetic
regulatory factor NSD2 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-
related mortality in the United States and worldwide, leading to over a 1.8 million deaths each year. LUAD is its
most common histological type of lung cancer. While new targeted and immunotherapies have improved median
survival for LUAD patients, unfortunately, improvement in outcomes over the past 20 years has been
incremental. Thus, there is great interest in identifying novel factors that might cooperate with the canonical
oncogenic pathways that drive LUAD with the notion that a therapeutic strategy hitting multiple pathways will
mitigate potential drug toxicity by lowering the overall dose needed for each medicine and in parallel combat
resistance development. A central hypothesis to be tested here is that the clinically actionable and histone lysine
36 (H3K36) di-methyltransferase enzyme NSD2 is such a factor. In preliminary work we found that NSD2
promotes aggressive malignant tumor progression and rapid lethality in a classis LUAD mouse model. In our
proposal, we will investigate the molecular, epigenetic, cellular, and in vivo role of NSD2-H3K36me2 axis in lung
cancer and directly test the efficacy of NSD2-targeted therapy using a first-in-class NSD2 inhibitor and state-of-
the-art pre-clinical models of LUAD.
 In Aim 1 we investigate the role of NSD2 in lung cancer pathogenesis. We have developed a KRASG12C-
driven NSD2 tunable mouse lung cancer model to investigate the function and mechanism of action of elevated
or depleted NSD2 activity in LUAD initiation, progression, metastasis, and intratumoral heterogeneity. In Aim 2
we evaluate therapeutic efficacy of NSD2 inhibition using a first-in-class potent inhibitor of NSD2. We will utilize
genetic models such as LUAD driven by KRASG12C mutations and multiple patient derived LUAD xenografts to
test anti-tumor efficacy of NSD2 inhibition as a single agent and as part of combination therapies. Together, this
work will be the first to evaluate the therapeutic potential and mechanism-of-action of NSD2 in LUAD."

10820457,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a devastating disease of the central nervous system that affects over 2.3 million
people worldwide. Current therapies for MS are at best only partially effective, and there is no cure. Improved
understanding of MS disease mechanisms would lead to better diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. MS is
caused by both genetic and environmental risk factors. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the most consistently
replicated environmental factor. Mounting evidence indicates that EBV-infected B cells, and their downstream
immunological effects, are key drivers of MS disease processes. Recent work by our group and others implicates
the EBV-encoded EBNA2 gene regulatory protein in mechanisms at almost half of the established MS genetic
risk loci. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that EBNA2-driven allele-dependent alterations to human
gene expression lead to distinct B and T cell phenotypes directly contributing to disease processes in MS.
 Aim 1. Quantification of EBV-specific human gene expression in multiple MS patient
demographics. We will expand our cohort to include males and females of European, African, and Asian
ancestries. We will measure MS- and EBV-specific human gene expression in these cohorts.
 Aim 2. Global discovery of EBV- and MS genotype-dependent gene regulatory mechanisms. We
will use Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs) to systematically identify EBV- and risk allele-dependent
gene expression at all MS risk variants in primary B cells with and without EBV infection. We will identify human
transcriptional regulators acting with EBNA2, EBNA3C, and/or EBNA-LP at these loci and confirm their allele-
dependent actions in MS-derived B cells using cutting-edge functional genomics technologies. We will validate
these EBV- and genotype-dependent gene regulatory mechanisms using CRISPR-based genome editing of
patient-derived primary B cells at CD37, CD58, ZMIZ1, and other MS risk loci.
 Aim 3. Discovery of allelic EBV-based mechanisms altering cellular behavior in MS. We will gauge
the necessity and sufficiency of EBV and specific MS variants (e.g: CD37, CD58, ZMIZ1) on B cell function using
the CRISPR-edited B cells. We will measure impact on B cell receptor signaling, cytokine production,
proliferation, and apoptosis. We will use an inducible pluripotent stem cell-derived blood brain barrier (BBB)
endothelium model to measure the impact of EBV and MS risk alleles on B cell - BBB interactions.
 The concept that disease processes might be influenced by virus-controlled, allelic regulatory protein
complexes is highly innovative and has never before been demonstrated. Our work for the first time provides
mechanistic insight into the established role of EBV in MS through a unified gene by environment model.
Comprehensive cataloging, dissection, and understanding of the downstream effects of genetic mechanisms
impacted by EBV will be significant because it will provide strong rationale to develop therapies that interfere
with these mechanisms, or even vaccines that prevent EBV infection to cure MS and other EBV-related diseases."

More than 70,000 adolescents and young adults (AYAs) are diagnosed with cancer in the United States (US)
each year, and fewer than 10% enroll in clinical trials, reflecting far lower rates than seen in children and older
adults. Yet AYAs with cancer who enroll in therapeutic clinical trials have improved survival and better adherence
to long-term follow-up care during survivorship. In addition, clinical trial enrollment is essential to address inferior
survival gains seen in recent decades for the A YA age group as a whole.
Work in older adults has identified racial, ethnic, geographic, and socioeconomic disparities in clinical
trial enrollment. Black and Hispanic adults are underrepresented in clinical trials relative to whites, as are
patients in rural areas and with low incomes. Previous work to examine clinical trial participation among AYAs
has failed to examine trial perspectives among underrepresented groups or the key barriers that stand in the
way of their enrollment to therapeutic trials.
The proposed study will evaluate disparities in enrollment to clinical trials among AYAs with cancer
aged 12-29 years in 3 states: Louisiana, New Mexico, and Tennessee. All 3 states have among the highest
poverty rates in the United States, with a mix of rural and urban geography and racially and ethnically diverse
populations, including large numbers of Black and Hispanic AYAs as well as American Indian AYAs. We will
focus on three key barriers to clinical trial enrollment among A YAs: structural barriers of trial availability and
access, individual barriers such as financial concerns and beliefs about trials, and interpersonal barriers related
to communication about trials between patients, family members, and oncologists. These areas have been
identified in previous work in adults as remediable barriers to clinical trial enrollment with special relevance to
racially, ethnically, geographically, and socioeconomically diverse populations. Our aims are:
Aim 1: To assess AVA trial availability and access in 3 diverse states, including disparities by race,
ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geography. Using state cancer registry data and clinical trial availability
data from ClinicalTrials.gov, we will identify available trials and AYA populations with limited trial access.
Aim 2: To identify individual and interpersonal barriers to trial enrollment among AYAs with cancer,
including differences by race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geography. We will survey AYAs with
cancer, caregivers, and oncologists to examine willingness to enroll in trials; interview American Indian AYAs to
identify trial perspectives; and audiotape AYA-family-oncologist discussions to examine trial communication.
Impact: At the end of this study, we will have identified key structural, individual, and interpersonal barriers to
enrollment in clinical trials for A Y As in 3 states, including areas with special relevance to a racially, ethnically,
socioeconomically, and geographically diverse population, and prioritized areas for intervention. Our next step
will be the development of targeted interventions applicable across diverse settings to address identified barriers."

development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The proximal tubule (PT) is the primary target of AKI, triggering
profound changes in PT cellular metabolism that contribute to injury. Whilst uninjured PT cells utilize fatty acid
oxidation (FAO), TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP, in injury, these processes are
severely downregulated, with inadequate compensation from glycolysis. Experimental upregulation of FAO can
partially rescue AKI, but these strategies have so far not translated to clinical use. Furthermore, loss of the key
FAO regulator PPARa does not result in PT injury at baseline, suggesting that other important PT metabolic
pathways remain to be described. Branched chain amino acids (BCAA; valine, leucine, isoleucine) are
catabolized by the kidney to generate TCA cycle intermediates. We recently reported that genes encoding BCAA
catabolic enzymes are strongly downregulated in mouse models of AKI and CKD, and in human CKD, likely
driven by transcriptional repression by Krüppel-like factor 6 (KLF6). In vitro, this led to decreased ATP production,
whilst activation of BCAA catabolism increased mitochondrial respiration. However, the significance of
downregulated BCAA catabolism in AKI or CKD has not been explored. Potential effects of loss of BCAA
catabolism may include loss of ATP production, and toxic or detrimental accumulation of uncatabolized BCAA.
In particular, leucine is a potent activator of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1)
signaling, which may downregulate FAO, but this has not been demonstrated in kidney. This proposal will
address these current gaps in the field by testing our central hypothesis that transcriptional suppression of PT
BCAA catabolism in nephrotoxic AKI is detrimental via loss of ATP production, activation of mTORC1 signaling,
and suppression of FAO. This hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims, to: 1) elucidate the mechanism by
which disrupted BCAA catabolism alters FAO through mTORC1 activation; and 2) determine the contribution of
BCAA catabolism to the severity of AKI and transition to fibrosis. These studies will enhance understanding of
the significance of BCAA catabolism in the kidney, which is highly active yet currently unexplored. Furthermore,
the link between BCAA catabolism and the critical cellular pathways of mTORC1 signaling and FAO, all of which
are potentially druggable, will allow design of improved therapeutics for AKI. The long-term goal is to
comprehensively define PT metabolic alterations in nephrotoxic and non-nephrotoxic AKI."
10831523,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4), also known as cAMP-Response Element Binding Protein 2 (CREB2),
belongs to the ATF/cAMP responsive element-binding (CREB) protein family of transcription factors. As a well-
characterized stress-response transcription factor, ATF4 is constitutively and ubiquitously expressed at low
levels but can be rapidly induced under a variety of cell-stress conditions. Previous studies have shown that
ATF4 functions in diverse cell types and tissues under various physiological and pathological conditions,
including cardiac diseases. However, little is known as to the specific role of ATF4 and its target genes in
mammalian cardiac development. To address this gap in knowledge and to determine the role of ATF4 in
cardiomyocytes (CMs), we have generated novel Atf4 CM-specific constitutive knockout (cKO) and tamoxifen-
inducible CM-specific knockout (icKO) mouse lines. Our preliminary studies revealed that Atf4 cKO mice
exhibited perinatal death and cardiac morphological defects, associated with reduced CM proliferation. RNA-
seq and ChIP-seq analyses of embryonic ventricular tissues revealed upregulation of a series of cell cycle
arrest-associated genes known to be downstream of p53, and downregulation of a series of p53-independent
cardiac development/function and/or cell cycle progression associated genes, most of which harbored ATF4
binding regions, in Atf4 cKO mice. Loss of ATF4 in developing CMs also resulted in increased p53 protein
levels but not Trp53 mRNA levels. Moreover, p53 ablation in Atf4 cKO mice partially restored ventricular wall
thickness and ameliorated upregulation of p53 target cell cycle arrest genes at E17.5, but failed to rescue
lethality beyond postnatal day 1. Conversely, inducible ablation of Atf4 in adult CMs had no effect on cardiac
function or left ventricular dimension, suggesting distinct roles for ATF4 at specific stages of CM development.
Taken together, the foregoing evidence leads us to the hypothesis that ATF4 plays an essential role in CM
proliferation and function via p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms at specific stages of cardiac
development. Accordingly, our Specific Aims are: 1. To determine the role of ATF4 in cardiomyocyte
proliferation and cardiac development by analyzing Atf4 cardiomyocyte-specific knockout (Atf4 cKO) mice, and
to elucidate mechanisms by which ATF4 regulates target gene pathways in a p53-dependent and/or
-independent manner; and 2. To determine times at which ATF4 is required for embryonic and neonatal
cardiomyocyte proliferation and function (from E7.5 to P30) by analysis of Atf4 inducible cardiomyocyte-
specific knockout (icKO) mice. Our proposed studies will help us to understand the specific roles of ATF4 and
p53, as well as other novel ATF4 targets in CMs at critical developing stages in vivo, as well as to determine a
safe therapeutic window for the potential application of ATF4 and/or p53 inhibitors in cardiac diseases."
10819562,"Abstract
Mutations in the CACNA1A gene, which encodes the pore-forming subunit of the P/Q type calcium
channel (Cav2.1), lead to neurological disorders including Episodic Ataxia type 2 (EA2) and Familial
Hemiplegic Migraine type 1 (FHM1). Patients have typically been classified as having one of these disorders or
the other, but symptoms are often overlapping and the distinction has been called into question. More recently,
CACNA1A patients presenting primarily with cognitive defects such as intellectual disability or developmental
delay have been described, suggesting that a more salient dichotomy may lie between mutations that lead to
severe motor deficits and those that are characterized primarily by cognitive dysfunction. Motor dysfunction
such as ataxia has been attributed to disruption of neuronal excitability and pacemaking function of cerebellar
Purkinje cells, where these channels are most highly expressed. In contrast, t he underlying mechanisms
leading to cognitive dysfunction remain unknown. However, Cav2.1 channels are also expressed throughout
the nervous system at presynaptic terminals where they mediate synaptic vesicle release. The varying
functional consequences of different CACNA1A mutations underscore the importance of delineating the impact
of each CACNA1A mutation on channel expression and function to understand how each causes the
associated disease phenotypes. We hypothesize that mutations that effect primarily neuronal excitability result
in classical motor phenotypes, while those that effect synaptic properties may give rise to cognitive deficits. To
begin to address this, we propose to characterize an array of CACNA1A patient mutations resulting in either
primarily motor or primarily cognitive presentations. We have validated and now propose to combine two model
systems to characterize the effect of these mutations: a heterologous expression system (HEK293t cells) to
assess cell-surface expression and biophysical properties using molecular, imaging, and whole cell
electrophysiology techniques, as well as the nematode C. elegans to investigate in vivo presynaptic
localization and synaptic function. This work will lay the foundation for elucidating the mechanism by which
CACNA1A mutations affect neuronal function and lead to pleiotropic patient outcomes."
10854935,"Project Summary
 Males produce sperm continuously through adult life, driven by the renewal of spermatogonial stem cells
(SSCs). The long-term objective of this application is to determine the role of a novel epigenetic program that
we have recently identified in regulating the renewal of adult SSCs. SSCs can both self-renew and produce
progenitor spermatogonia that will differentiate to initiate spermatogenesis. The balance between SSC self-
renewal and differentiation is key for life-long production of sperm in adult males. Both SSC transplantation and
in vitro SSC cultures have enabled functional studies of SSC and allowed for advancement of translational
applications in animal transgenesis. However, while much is known about spermatogenesis, the regulation of
SSC self-renewal remains poorly understood. Stem cell renewal requires both stem cell-intrinsic factors and
external niche factors, only a handful of which have been identified (PLZF, RB, NANOS2, GDNF, ETV5, etc.).
Notably, their functions in SSC self-renewal have been revealed through genetic studies. Despite these
advances, the molecular biological control of SSC remains poorly understood. We have identified an
epigenetic factor DOT1L, the sole H3K79 methyltransferase, as a novel master regulator of mouse SSC self-
renewal. Moreover, by chemically inhibiting DOT1L, we were able to identify specific target genes that likely
contribute to SSC renewal. We propose an innovative multi-pronged (genetic, chemical, genomic, and
proteomic) approach to comprehensively elucidate this novel epigenetic program in SSCs. As failure in SSC
self-renewal leads to a lack of sperm production and thus male infertility, completion of this project will lay a
firm foundation for molecular dissection of SSC stem cell renewal and open new avenues of research in SSC
biology and reproductive medicine."
10849681,"Background: [With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, VA primary care (PC) experienced a substantial
increase in video-based encounters, nationwide. This rapid uptake of video-based care in PC clinics, however,
varied by site. Given that the VA is committed to continue expanding VA Video Connect (VVC), which is the main
videoconferencing platform at the VA, more research is needed to comprehensively examine why and how VVC
was successfully adopted at some sites and understand why VVC expansion was limited at other sites.]
Significance/Impact: [Barriers and facilitators to video-based care are many and multifaceted. This study will
examine patient, provider, and site-level characteristics of VVC use in PC at high and low VVC sites, and identify
patient-centered, provider-recommended, and leadership supported VVC guidelines that are context-specific for
PC clinics. This study will contribute more generally to our understanding of what is needed to achieve
acceptance of video technology. Such knowledge will be helpful for VA, as well as the delivery of healthcare in
general. In-depth understanding about challenges and successes of VVC use will inform future improvements of
VVC policies, processes, and procedures for all Veterans, across all VA facilities.]
Innovation: This study will examine Veterans’ perspectives about how VVC in PC can be improved to better
meet their needs when using video-based care. This is an understudied topic. Furthermore, by learning about
the providers’ and leadership’s perspectives on how VVC can be implemented more effectively, we will better
understand the full context of VA video care. [This 18-month pilot study will create context-specific VVC playbook
for high and low VVC using sites that will be patient-centered, provider-recommended, and leadership
supported. This will help improve delivery of video-based primary care and patient outcomes at the VA.]
Specific Aims: This pilot study’s overall objective is to identify strategies to improve VVC use for all Veterans.
1) Identify PC clinic sites in the top 5% and bottom 5% of VVC use nationally by examining patient, provider,
and site-level variations in VVC use since the onset of COVID-19 (March 2020-March 2024, aka study period).
2) Characterize patient-, provider-, site-specific factors associated with VVC use in PC, nationwide, during the
study period.
3) Evaluate barriers and facilitators to using VVC in PC from patients, providers, and leadership
(VISN/VAMC/CBOC) perspectives at 3 high and 3 low VVC using sites in PC (identified in Aims 1 & 2).
Methodology: [The non-adoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability (NASSS) framework will
be used for all aspects of the proposed study (data collection, analyses, synthesis of quantitative and qualitative
findings). Two sequential, mixed methods approaches will be used, where quantitative analyses (Aims 1 & 2) will
first inform the sampling and data collection for the qualitative interviews (Aim 3, n=60) at 3 high and 3 low
VVC sites with patients, providers, and leadership. Using the explanatory mixed methods, the qualitative data
will then help explain quantitative findings. In addition to in-depth interviews, the qualitative research will
include document reviews on video-based care and VVC use for all 6 study sites After completing all analyses,
quantitative and qualitative study findings will be mapped into the NASSS framework, which will help inform
the development of patient-centered, provider-recommended, leadership-supported, and context-specific VVC
playbook for PC clinics. The playbook will include strategies on how to improve VVC for high and low VVC sites.
In close collaboration with all study operation partners (OCC, OPC, VEO), study Co-Investigators, and Veteran
Engagement Groups (VEG), the playbook will be assessed for feasibility and usability.]
Next Steps/Implementation: [To assess the effectiveness of the VVC playbook, future studies can pilot test the
playbook at PC clinics at multiple VA sites. Pilot testing the playbook will provide the opportunity to receive
feedback from different sites on how best to make the playbook suitable for all sites at the VA, nationally.]"
10881877,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Blood clots kill more humans than any other single pathogenic cause. A new or recurrent diagnosis of venous
thromboembolism (VTE), which encompasses both pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis
(DVT), affects >900,000 people each year in the US alone. Current PE standard of care includes the delivery
of acute clot digesting enzymes such as recombinant tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA), administered IV or
by catheter. All currently FDA cleared clot digesting enzymes rely on activation of the patient’s endogenous
plasminogen converting nearly all of it to active clot digesting plasmin. This widespread activation massively
depletes plasmin regulatory proteins, causing unchecked digestion of both pathogenic and beneficial blood
clots resulting in a 5-10% rate of major bleeding complications, including intracranial hemorrhage. Due to
safety concerns and contraindications nearly 50% of patients that would benefit from active clot digesting
interventions are not eligible to receive the current therapy. Direct infusion of exogenous active plasmin to
digest blood clots is limited due to the nearly instantaneous inactivation by circulating α2-antiplasmin (serpin
protein) and α2-macroglobulin (steric inhibitor). To address the current limitations of plasmin infusion as a
direct fibrinolytic therapeutic intervention, a novel clot digesting delivery strategy leveraging multivalent
enzymatic control is necessary. Preliminary data demonstrates that reversible competitive inhibitors can be
used to deliver active plasmin with reduced inactivation from regulatory proteins in-vitro while still allowing
efficient clot digestion; however, there is critical need to determine the underlying characteristics responsible
for protection and delivery of plasmin as a direct fibrinolytic in-vivo. This proposal will identify critical
relationships that contribute to multivalent control of active enzymes in-vivo for the novel clinical translation
of therapeutic interventions to digest blood clots with an improved safety profile. Aim 1: Determine how homo-
and hetero-multivalent inhibitors impact inhibition of plasmin and its interactions with regulatory proteins in-
vitro; Aim 2: Evaluate the impact of reversible multivalent enzyme inhibition on clot digestion efficiency of
standardized ex-vivo blood clots under shear; and, Aim 3: Examine the impact of multivalent inhibitor
delivered plasmin on clot targeting and digestion in-vivo. Overall, these experiments will identify key
multivalent enzyme delivery principles and provide lead compounds to be further developed. A safer direct
fibrinolytic therapeutic will have expanded indications for use that include: ischemic stroke, myocardial
infarction, limb ischemia, PE, DVT, and occluded vascular catheters."

This application from a “New Investigator” is in response to Parent Announcement PA-20-185 “NIH Research
Project Grant (Parent R01 Clinical Trial Not Allowed)” and requests 5 years of support to study the contribution
of gabapentinoids to the opioid crisis. The number of opioid overdoses and deaths continues to increase despite
a significant decrease in the number of prescriptions for opioids. At the same time, the use of gabapentinoids
(gabapentin [Neurontin®]) and pregabalin [Lyrica®]) has increased significantly. Although typically prescribed
to treat seizures and convulsions, increasingly gabapentinoids are used off-label as alternatives to opioids and
there is mounting concern that misuse of gabapentinoids is contributing to opioid-induced morbidity and
mortality. Pregabalin is classified as a Schedule V controlled substance by the Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA). Although gabapentin currently is not scheduled by the DEA, it is scheduled in five states and there is
mounting pressure from various consumer and advocacy groups for the DEA to schedule gabapentin. These
drugs appear to pose a significantly greater risk to public health than has thought to be the case, particularly
because gabapentinoids are increasingly detected in opioid overdose victims. Because they are presumed to be
very safe and not likely to be abused, little is known about the potential risk of gabapentinoids when used with
other drugs, including the following: 1) whether gabapentinoids enhance the abuse related and/or toxic effects
of opioids; 2) whether a history of opioid use increases the likelihood of misuse of gabapentinoids; and 3) whether
gabapentinoids cause physical dependence and/or impact opioid physical dependence. Our pilot studies show
that gabapentinoids reduce the potency of naloxone to reverse ventilatory depression by heroin and increase the
potency of fentanyl in a drug discrimination assay. Proposed studies address the paucity of information regarding
potential adverse effects of gabapentinoids, particularly in combination with opioids, and explore three specific
aims that test the following hypotheses: 1) gabapentinoids reduce the potency of naloxone to reverse the
ventilatory-depressant effects of mu opioid receptor agonists; 2) a history of opioid exposure
unmasks/enhances the positive reinforcing effects of gabapentinoids; and 3) gabapentinoids attenuate opioid
withdrawal, and exacerbate opioid physical dependence. Because this is an unexplored area of research, it is
unclear whether gabapentinoid/opioid interactions are sex dependent. By systematically comparing the effects
of gabapentinoids and opioids, alone and in mixtures, in female and male rats, these studies will provide a much-
needed comprehensive assessment of the risk potential (ventilatory depression, self-administration,
reinstatement, drug discrimination, and physical dependence) of gabapentinoids when used in combination with
opioids. The opioid crisis has worsened significantly during the pandemic and previously unappreciated forms
of drug use (e.g., increasing use of gabapentinoids in individuals also taking opioids) demand our attention in
order to address this growing national public health crisis that is decreasing the life expectancy of Americans."
10768776,"Dozens of malaria species, of the genus Plasmodium, infect human and nonhuman primates worldwide. At
least eight of these parasite species have moved from primate reservoirs into human populations, including
historical host expansion of P. vivax and P. falciparum, the two primary malaria-causing agents in humans
worldwide. As we make progress towards elimination of these common malaria parasites, emerging host
switches or expansions that introduce new or rare malaria parasites into human population are an increasing
barrier to global elimination. Indeed, in parts of Southeast Asia, a zoonotic malaria parasite is now the main
cause of clinical malaria. The lack of genomic resources for zoonotic malaria strains, particularly from wild
primates, has been a major barrier to understanding the emergence of malaria parasites and their risk for
spread in human populations. Using the emerging zoonotic parasite from Brazil, P. simium, as a case study,
we combine whole-genome sequencing of multiple parasite and their host populations to characterize the
genetic basis of host specificity and evolution in malaria parasites. P. simium is an ideal system because it is a
close relative of the well-studied P. vivax, and importantly, has recently shifted host ranges twice, first from
historical human P. vivax into primates, and more recently back into humans. To interpret this new genomic
data, we will combine experimental techniques with development of a whole-genome simulation framework
that incorporated aspects of parasite lifecycle to better interpret neutral genetic diversity. This opens up recent
developments in simulation-based inference techniques that we will use to infer the population history of South
American malaria parasites, the timing of zoonoses, and identify loci under selection in multiple hosts. The
function of candidate loci identified from computational approaches will then be tested with a specially-
developed transgenic line expressing P. simium genes and computational modeling of protein structures from
host and parasites. In sum, we combine insights from parasite genomics with complementary analyses of
whole genomes from their wild primate hosts—from computational methods development to functional
experiments—giving insight into the selective pressures that parasites face inside hosts and host-specific
susceptibility."
10906007,"We plan to add an electron diffraction component to a native protein mass spectrometer to create a new instrument that
can derive atomic structures of macromolecules such as proteins. The key innovation is the use of superfluid helium
droplets for sample cooling thereby effective field induced orientation and alignment. Mass and conformation selected
proteins from a native electrospray ionization mass spectrometer are embedded in superfluid helium droplets, and in a
pulsed electric field and elliptically polarized laser field, due to the permanent and induced dipoles of the protein, all three
Euler angles of the protein can be precisely defined. The large polarizability volume of macromolecules (not the
permanent dipole moment) and the low rotational temperature of the embedded macromolecules are the two elements of
the “molecular goniometer”: changing the polarization properties of the laser field changes the orientation of the
macromolecule. Electron diffraction patterns from macromolecule-doped droplets, one molecule per droplet, all oriented
in the same direction, are accumulated with each successive pulse, until a satisfactory signal-to-noise ratio is achieved.
Ultimately from the diffraction patterns of all orientations of the chosen macromolecule, the electrostatic potential is
derived using the oversampling method for iterative phase retrieval and structure determination.
In the past few years, we have accumulated preliminary data on electron diffraction of small molecules and cationic
molecular clusters embedded in superfluid helium droplets, and on doping macromolecular ions into superfluid helium
droplets. The next phase of the project is to construct a complete instrument to demonstrate the principle of the concept.
We now can solve structures of nanocrystals embedded in superfluid helium droplets, both neutral and charged, without
sample alignment. Therefore the background issue of the enclosing helium and the particle density issue of charged
species are no longer major concerns. Our demonstrated resolution from pyrene dimer cations is 0.5 Å. Moreover, we
have succeeded in doping macromolecular ions into superfluid helium droplets using a standard electrospray ionization
source. Our accomplishments so far have laid the foundation for the next phase of progress, and we are now ready to
demonstrate the principle of the concept. With the acquisition of a new electron gun, a upgrade to a native protein ion
source, and a direct electron detector, we have a detailed plan to align all three pulsed beams, the laser beam, the ion
doped droplet beam, and the electron beam, to obtain diffraction patterns of field aligned macromolecules.
Our ultimate goal is to resolve atomic structures of mass and conformation selected macromolecules with 1 Å resolution
from mixtures of protein solutions, microfluidic reactors, or labeled cells for proteins and protein complexes. The final
instrument will reshape the landscape of structural biology, transform structure-based drug screening, and rapidly
determine effects of mutations and deletions on structure. It will also offer structural assessment of components in
polydisperse mixtures of nanomaterials important for biomedical applications. To mitigate the risks, we have recruited a
specialist in mass spectrometry, Dr. David Russell, to be our consultant, and a specialist in data processing, Dr. Peter
Schwander, to be a member of our team."
10795868,"Immunotherapies such as PD-1 blockade have revolutionized cancer care. Yet
most patients do not experience sustained (durable) benefit from blockade of T cell
inhibitory receptors. Unfortunately, current biomarkers do not adequately predict patient
response or resistance to immunotherapy; and successful strategies to overcome
immunotherapy resistance have been lacking. Both gaps reflect our incomplete
understanding of how durable immunity carried out by T cells is achieved. Progenitor T
cells normally balance the mutually opposing demands of differentiation and self-
renewal by transmitting unequal anabolic activating signals to daughter cells. In the
setting of cancer, however, sustained T cell activation skews the normal
regenerative equilibrium of balanced differentiation and renewal towards progressive
dysfunction of differentiated cells along with progressive loss of self-renewing T cells. It
was previously presumed that PD-1 blockade acted by restoring potency to the most
dysfunctional T cells. Instead, emerging consensus has demonstrated that PD-1
blockade can only function by inducing greater division and differentiation of self-
renewing T cells, which are already in peril. This preclinical and translational application
marshals our basic discoveries concerning the signaling and cell biology of T cell
regeneration to tackle a major clinical roadblock in cancer care. Performing the aims of
this proposal will enable determination of 1) whether anti-cancer immunity and
immunotherapy impact the self-renewal of CD8+ T cells; 2) whether immunotherapy can
be improved by augmenting CD8+ T cell self-renewal; and 3) whether patient response
and resistance to immune checkpoint blockade can be predicted from the abundance of
self-renewing T cells. This proposal would address two critical unmet patient needs: a
non-invasive predictive biomarker for response and resistance to immunotherapy
across cancer types; and a novel strategy for resistance-directed treatment enabling
immunotherapy to benefit the majority, rather than the minority of patients."
10907044,"Project Summary/Abstract
Large knowledge gaps remain regarding strategies to promote the adoption of hydroxyurea (HU), particularly in
sub-Saharan African countries including Nigeria, where more than 75% of annual sickle cell anemia births occur.
The vast majority of people with SCD in Africa do not receive evidenced-based health care (e.g., newborn
screening, health education, prophylaxis for infection, optimal nutrition and hydration, blood transfusion,
transcranial Doppler screening, and HU therapy), despite its effectiveness in reducing SCD-related adverse
outcomes and mortality. The use of HU in SSA is <1% among SCD patients. Our preliminary findings indicate
that provider-level barriers are significant and must be addressed to improve HU adoption. To address HU
adoption we will use the NIH-funded study (e.g., Realizing Effectiveness Across Continents with Hydroxyurea
(REACH) Clinical Trial (NCT01966731)) that developed an evidence-informed, clinical, practical, and easy-to-
follow algorithm to 1) Screen patients for sickle cell disease (SCD), 2) Initiate HU treatment, and 3) Maintain HU
dosage over time (SIM) for the improved management of SCD as our intervention. The Nigerian government
released guidelines supporting the SIM intervention for HU adoption for improved SCD management, and HU is
on the list of essential medicines for Nigeria. Our implementation strategy for improving SCD management in
Nigeria uses a practical and replicable evidence-based task-sharing strategy, TAsk-Strengthening Strategy for
Hemoglobinopathies (TASSH), adopted from our TAsk-Strengthening Strategy for Hypertension control
(TASSH) trials in Ghana and Nigeria containing the essential components of i) Training healthcare
workers/providers to be more patient-centered in clinical consultations, ii) Clinical reminders, and iii) Practice
facilitation (TCP) known as (TASSH TCP) for SCD management. Using a sequential exploratory mixed-methods
study design, we will conduct this study using the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment
(EPIS) framework in four sequential phases to assess the effectiveness of SIM adoption by providers in the
context of the TASSH TCP implementation strategy in Nigeria."
10829482,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most prevalent cancer type, with over 650,000
cases diagnosed annually worldwide. Positive margins are reported in up to 30% of head and neck cancer sur-
geries, where margin status is a major prognostic factor for overall survival. While preoperative x-ray, computed
tomography (CT) and ultrasound imaging have enabled in depth evaluation, diagnosis, and surgical planning, a
gap continues to exists between preoperative imaging and intraoperative reality. Accurate surgical identification
of the tumor margins and small lesions remains challenging. Surprisingly, no clinically approved technology can
directly enhance intraoperative guidance for tumor resection and tis-sue preservation for head and neck cancers,
which are typically performed through anatomical knowledge, visual cues and palpation. Fluorescence Guided
Surgery (FGS) has successfully integrated into clinical medicine with only two FDA-approved near-infrared (NIR,
650-900 nm) fluorophores. FGS systems operate almost exclusively in the NIR region, where tissue chromo-
phore absorbance, autofluorescence and scatter fall to local minima, permitting high contrast and high-resolution
imaging at depths up to a centimeter. Intraoperative guidance with tumor-specific FGS could significantly improve
surgical outcomes for head and neck cancer patients, providing a new paradigm for surgery. An important con-
sideration for wide clinical adoption is ease of implementation into the current surgical workflow. Presently, the
majority of FGS contrast agents under development are classified as “always-on” probes, where continuous
fluorescence emission occurs throughout imaging, regardless of the probe proximity to its binding target. Off-
target accumulation of these always-on probes leads to elevated background signal, and a considerable amount
of time is required for the non-specific probe accumulation to be cleared to generate adequate tumor-to-back-
ground ratio (TBR) for decision-making during the surgery. Patients are required to receive contrast agent injec-
tion days before surgery. For patients, this implicates additional hospital visits with extra costs and stress. This
is in part due to large probe size resulting in limited extravasation, long circulation times, and impaired tumor
penetration. To alleviate these challenges, smaller targeting moieties with high specificity and affinity are highly
desirable to provide superior TBR shortly after systemic administration, permitting ready integration into the ex-
isting surgical workflow. Herein, we propose to develop a novel tumor-targeted FGS solution to address this
unmet clinical need. We will develop first-in-class NIR fluorogenic probes that target mutants of EGFR in head
and neck cancer, where high TBR will be crucial for accurate tumor margin assessment, the detection of small
tumor nodules, residue lesions and multi-focal disease. These novel fluorogenic probes as intraoperative aid
capable of identifying and distinguishing these tumors in real time with high sensitivity and specificity could sig-
nificantly reduce positive margin rates and improve surgical outcomes for head and neck cancer patients."
10865077,"Our KL2 program seeks to develop the careers of 3 highly qualified scholars (junior faculty) at any given time.
The goal is that scholars become translational scientists who will possess both the fundamental NCATS 
competencies and 7 essential characteristics that will enable them to become transformational agents of change
across the translational research spectrum. These 7 characteristics are: boundary crosser, team player, 
process innovator, domain expert, rigorous researcher, skilled communicator, and systems thinker. We will 
accomplish this by offering mentoring via a transdisciplinary team, a structured curriculum, and multiple 
enrichment opportunities. The typical scholar will have a 2-year tenure, submit an application for extramural funding
as PI, and acquire an MSCI, although PhD level work is also possible, and not all scholars may work towards a
formal degree. Another new feature for this application is a choice of 5 formal pathways (for both degree and
non-degree scholars), 4 of which represent specialization in a translational domain (e.g. data science). The
KL2 is fully integrated into the UMCCTS K program, which is an umbrella program modeled after the KL2 but
adding 3 additional institutionally funded K scholars."
10869966,"Over half a million U.S. veterans have Alzheimer’s disease (AD). With AD diagnoses increasing each
year, treatments are urgently needed. Despite this need, no clear effective treatment exists for AD and
interventions tested in nonhuman models often fail to translate to successful clinical trials. As women are more
likely to develop AD than men, AD treatments must address sex as determining factor when evaluating
treatments prior to clinical use. Optimized treatments that have the potential to reverse AD neuropathology and
mitigate cognitive impairment at prodromal stages, prior to neural degeneration and cell death, are required.
 Exposure to noninvasive audiovisual neurostimulation at 40Hz (gamma flicker) stimulates neural activity
in brain regions first affected by AD pathology that are important for learning and memory, including the
hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Gamma flicker recruits microglia, the primary immune cell of
the brain, in the HPC and visual cortex in male 5XFAD mouse models of amyloidosis, as well as cytokine
expression in WT male mice. Neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine modulate the activation,
proliferation, and cytokine release from immune cells. Further, AD pathology includes disrupted expression of
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), an important trophic factor for learning and memory. These
neuromodulators are reduced as AD progresses, revealing potential therapeutic targets for treating neural
dysfunction and disease. Despite known sex differences in AD pathology, there is a knowledge gap on how
flicker noninvasively elicits changes in the immune response, neuromodulators, and cognition in females.
Preliminary data in female 5XFAD mouse models of aggressive amyloid accumulation in AD suggest that
different frequencies could be key to optimally tuning neurostimulation for each sex. Thus, the central goal of
this proposal is to test the hypothesis that specific frequencies of audiovisual flicker are optimal for altering the
neuroimmune response of microglia and neuromodulators in brain regions important for learning and memory
affected by neurodegenerative disease for each sex. Through the CDA2 proposed research, male and female
5XFAD mice will be exposed to chronic audiovisual flicker (1hr/ day for 7 days), then flicker’s effects on 1) the
spectrum of glia reactivity across stimulation frequencies, 2) trophic factors and neurotransmitters that alter glia
reactivity, cognition, and neuroplasticity, and 3) working memory performance, will be measured.
 The proposed research will take place over the proposed 5-year timeline of the CDA2 at the Center for
Visual and Neurocognitive Rehabilitation (CVNR) of the Atlanta VA. The resources available include the Atlanta
CVNR, Emory University’s Goizueta Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, the Department of Biomedical
Engineering at Georgia Tech, and Emory’s Proteomics and Microscopy cores. The mentoring team and the
CVNR will support training in research techniques, lab management, and grant writing to provide Dr. Prichard
with a strong foundation to achieve her goals of independence through the submission of a VA Merit Award.
 Through her unique training at Emory University and Georgia Tech, combined with the training through
the CDA2, Dr. Prichard will ultimately pursue a career in research and mentoring as a tenure-track professor and
VA researcher in her future comparative cognition and neuropathology lab. She will utilize rodent models for
assessment of flicker’s effects on AD pathology and apply this to noninvasive studies of pet dogs with canine
cognitive dysfunction, a naturally occurring form of human-like AD pathology. The first step in this career path is
to train at the Atlanta VA to establish the effects of flicker on the immune response and neuromodulators,
explicitly addressing sex as an important factor in disease etiology, progressing toward treatment in higher-order
animal models and ultimately clinical trials. Upon completion of the fellowship, she will have learned valuable
research techniques in cell morphology, neuroimmune responses, and protein analyses, developed a strong
background in aging research and disease pathology, and built a network of VA mentors and collaborators."
10793585,"Low back pain, which is most commonly caused by intervertebral disc degeneration, is the most common source
of chronic pain in veterans. Current clinical treatments for disc degeneration, including spinal fusion, are limited
in that they do not restore healthy disc structure or function. To overcome this limitation, our group has developed
a whole, tissue engineered endplate-modified disc-like angle ply structure (eDAPS) composed of engineered
annulus fibrosus, nucleus pulposus and endplate regions. To date, we have completed the long-term evaluation
of the eDAPS in a small animal model, in addition to short-term evaluation in a large animal, goat cervical disc
replacement model. The overarching goal of the current proposal is to generate in vitro and in vivo data to
motivate the first in man trials of this technology. We will achieve this translational goal via the following specific
aims: Specific Aim 1: Evaluate the long-term function of a tissue-engineered intervertebral disc replacement that
is subjected to physiologic loading in our large animal model. In this Aim, we will first establish the duration of
immobilization necessary for optimal long-term performance of the tissue engineered disc in vivo. We will then
develop and test a resorbable provisional fixation system to be utilized in conjunction with the engineered disc
implant, which will eliminate the need for a second surgery and increase the clinical translatability of our
technology. Specific Aim 2: Determine the ability of a tissue-engineered disc replacement to restore healthy
motion segment structure and function when implanted in a degenerative environment. In this Aim, we will induce
degeneration of the goat cervical intervertebral disc using our established model of chondroitinase ABC injection.
After degeneration has progressed for 12 weeks, a second surgery will be performed to implant the eDAPS with
the resorbable fixation system developed in Aim 1. Animals will be euthanized after 1 year of eDAPS
implantation. During this time, implant status will be tracked with serial radiographs and in vivo MRI. A custom
EMG and kinematic tracking system will be implemented to assess cervical spine muscle activation and range
of motion as objective measures of pain and function. At the 1 year study endpoint, eDAPS implants will be
compared to untreated, degenerative controls by analyzing the structural and function properties across the
whole motion segment (disc/implant, facet joints, neural structures) using a multiscale and multimodal approach.
Aim 3: Fabricate anatomical tissue-engineered discs from human cell sources. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the use
of different human mesenchymal cell sources for the seeding of the eDAPS constructs. Human bone marrow
derived stem cells will be utilized, in addition to AF-like and NP-like cells derived from human induced pluripotent
stem cells and compared to native disc tissue cells. The cell source yielding constructs with structure-function
properties nearest to the native human disc will be utilized to generate eDAPS sized for the human lumbar and
cervical spine. Overall, the proposed work will significantly drive the translation of the eDAPS implant towards
clinical use and advance the state of the art in spine therapeutics."

Melanocytes are a key cell lineage in the skin and are required for skin pigmentation. Defects in melanocyte
development and function can lead to pigmentation disorders causing hypo or hyperpigmentation as well as one
of the most deadly forms of skin cancer, melanoma. Many of the transcriptional and signaling events which cause
these diseases have been explored, however, there has been little investigation into the role of the metabolic
environment and intracellular metabolic state of the melanocyte during development. Recent work from our lab
has demonstrated that during melanoma progression, adipocytes in the tumor microenvironment can transfer
fatty acids to the melanoma cells, promoting invasion. This raises the question of whether fatty acid uptake plays
a role in normal melanocytes. Our preliminary data suggests that melanocytes require extrinsic uptake of fatty
acids through Fatty Acid Transport Proteins (FATPs) for proper differentiation. In Aim 1, we will investigate the
relative importance of fatty acid uptake and de novo fatty acid synthesis in the melanocyte. We will
compare multiple mechanisms of fatty acid uptake as well as fatty acid synthesis to determine which play the
most important role in melanocyte development and pattern formation. We will also dissect in a stage specific
manner when these pathways are required by the melanocyte during differentiation using genetic perturbations.
We hypothesize that the importance of fatty acids in the melanocyte reflects certain lineage specific needs,
including high levels of fatty acids to support phospholipid synthesis and dendrite formation. In Aim 2 we will
examine the importance of fatty acids as building blocks for phospholipid synthesis relative to a
requirement for fatty acid breakdown through b-oxidation. There is evidence for the importance of
phospholipid synthesis in other dendritic cell types. Because melanocytes also form extensive dendrites which
are critical for proper pigmentation we will dissect the importance major phospholipid synthesis pathways to the
melanocyte in a stage specific manner. Conversely, melanocytes might break down fatty acids as a source of
ATP to support cell proliferation and migration. We will also determine the role b-oxidation in melanocyte
development by targeting key proteins in this pathway in a stage specific manner. We will assess the effects of
these genetic perturbations on energy production and melanocyte development. To perform these studies we
will primarily rely on zebrafish as an in vivo model of melanocyte development. We will use stage specific
promoters for the neural crest, melanoblast, and melanocyte to generate stable germline transgenics. Using a
combination of genetic methods and image analysis we will investigate the role of fatty acid and lipid metabolism
in melanocyte development. When appropriate, we will also apply an in vitro model of melanocyte development,
based on the differentiation of melanocytes from human pluripotent stem cells These combined experiments will
lead to novel discoveries regarding the role of metabolism in melanocyte development, which could increase our
understanding and treatment of pigmentation diseases."

Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a growing public health concern and has a high prevalence, morbidity, and
mortality. Sexual violence (SV) and OUD co-occur at high rates. Among individuals with OUD, SV is associated
with a severe clinical course (e.g., increased substance use) and poorer OUD treatment outcomes (e.g.,
premature discontinuation). Despite clear clinical relevance of the role of SV in OUD treatment, no studies have
explicated mechanisms that contribute to the worsening of outcomes. One such mechanism is shame. Shame
is pronounced among individuals in OUD treatment as well as those who have a history of SV. Operationalized
as the emotional core of stigma, shame is cyclical in nature and fluctuates daily in response to internal and
environmental cues. However, no study has evaluated the role of shame in relation to short-term (cravings,
substance use, medication adherence, motivation for changing substance use, self-efficacy for changing
substance use) and long-term clinical outcomes (number of appointments missed, treatment dropout) for
individuals in OUD treatment, in the context of other factors that impact treatment (social support, psychological
distress, prior treatment history, stressful events). The specific aims of the K99 phase of this K99/R00 are to 1)
iteratively develop and refine an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol among individuals with OUD
treatment with a history of SV, which will facilitate formative work and training in EMA. To accomplish this aim,
an initial EMA survey protocol will be developed based on prior literature, followed by a 30-day EMA pilot (n=20-
24, in two phases), which will be then followed by individual cognitive interviews to inform the final EMA measures
and protocol in the R00 phase. The specific aim of the R00 phase is to identify the associations between
momentary fluctuations in shame and short-term clinical outcomes as well as aggregate levels of shame and
long-term clinical outcomes among a sample of 122 individuals engaged in OUD treatment with a lifetime history
of SV, using EMA. Participants will complete baseline measures, 30 days of EMA, and follow-up assessments
at 3- and 6 months. The PI, Dr. Bhuptani, will work with an experienced team of mentors with complementary
areas of knowledge/expertise (Drs. Ana Abrantes, Jennifer Merrill, and Lindsay Orchowski) to develop expertise
in three areas of training that are well-matched to the career goals of the PI, including (1) EMA methods and
analysis, (2) measurement of OUD-specific outcomes, and (3) professional development skills. Successful
completion of the research and training detailed in this proposal will prepare the PI to become an independent
clinical scientist and develop a program of research focused on identifying mechanisms that impact clinical and
treatment outcomes among individuals with comorbid substance use and trauma conditions. Identifying event-
level associations between shame and clinical outcomes will be the first step in the development of just-in-time
interventions to improve such outcomes."
10867448,"Project Summary
The developing mammalian cochlea generates two types of mechanosensors: Inner hair cells (IHCs), endowed
with a prominent presynaptic apparatus, transmit sound information to neurons and the brain; outer hair cells
(OHCs), endowed for electromotility, are used for amplification and sharp frequency discrimination of sounds.
We found that the T-box transcription factor TBX2, expressed in IHCs, is a master regulator of their
differentiation, preventing IHCs from transdifferentiating into OHCs. Elimination of TBX2 from IHCs at various
embryonic and postnatal stages results in their conversion into OHCs. We hypothesize that TBX2 not only
induces IHC differentiation, but that it also functions subsequently for them to maintain their fate. We also
hypothesize that TBX2, in addition to being necessary, is also sufficient to elicit the IHC vs OHC differentiation
pattern. We will identify the genes regulated by TBX2 and driving IHC vs OHC differentiation, including the
chain of gene-expression events leading from one cell type to the other. We also inquire whether TBX2 acts as
a transcriptional activator or repressor, and whether it acts by modifying the epigenome of IHCs, either opening
regulatory elements required for IHC differentiation or closing those required for OHC differentiation. To test
these and alternative hypotheses, we will perform ATAC-seq on developing and mature IHCs, OHCs, and
IHCs lacking TBX2 (all of which transdifferentiate into OHCs). Finally, we will identify the TBX2-binding sites in
the promoters and enhancers of the genes it regulates in order to trigger and/or maintain IHC differentiation.
These studies use the transdifferentiation of IHCs into OHCs (and vice versa) triggered by TBX2
missregulation as a means for elucidating the molecular mechanisms (transcriptomic and epigenomic) by
which the complementary IHCs and OHCs are generated in the developing cochlea."
10841689,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Male infertility impacts up to 7% of all men and has been shown to be associated with poor somatic health and
elevated individual and familial cancer risk. Significant epidemiological data links male infertility to poorer
somatic health compared with fertile men, manifesting as increased individual risks for prostate cancer, testis
cancer, colon cancer, cardiovascular disease and reduced life span. Recent work by our group has also
demonstrated that family members of infertile men are at higher risk of testis cancer and both major congenital
anomalies and pediatric cancer. Specifically, much of this work found different associations in men with severe
oligozoospermia (reduced sperm counts) compared with those with azoospermia, suggesting that their etiologies
are fundamentally different. In a follow up study that mined age and cause of death information from the Utah
Population Database (UPDB), we found that individuals with the highest quartile of age-adjusted germline
mutation rates live for five fewer years than those in the lowest quartile. This project aims to study a unique
population to measure mutations in the testis, mature sperm, and somatic tissue to test the hypotheses that
genomic instability underlies reduced fertility, and that genome instability in one’s germline is connected to
increased somatic mutation and mosaicism. We will test this through two aims. 1.) Assessment of whether
subfertile men have higher germline mutation rates than fertile men by examining complex pedigree data to
identify familial associations between male infertility and cancer risk and determine mutation rates in the germline
and somatic cells of 20 oligozoospermic men and 20 hyperzoospermic men. 2.) We will test whether higher
germline mutation rates are predictive of elevated somatic mutation rates and lower sperm counts by using
cadaveric organ donor tissue from testis, sperm, prostate, blood and colon to assess mutation rates. These two
aims will provide foundational datasets for the field and will be able to answer whether higher de-novo mutation
rates are the mechanistic link underlying both male infertility and poor somatic health."
10922790,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Bladder cancer is one of the top 10 most frequent cancers, yet the most underfunded cancer by NCI based on
funding dollars and ratio of funding/mortality. There has been no significant improvement in overall survival and
prognosis over the last thirty years except for the recent development of immunotherapy. After initial diagnosis
and treatment, over 60% of the BC patients will relapse within two years and progression into advanced stages
in up to 25% of patients. Therefore, almost all patients will need long-term expensive cystoscopy which makes
bladder cancer the costliest cancer (per case) of all cancer types. If a sensitive but less expensive method to
detect cancer were available, it would improve the treatment outcomes and decrease the cost. Dr. Xuefeng Liu
(PI) and his team recently invented a robust method of conditional reprogramming (CR) technology to establish
patient-derived cell models from cystoscopy or needle biopsies and urine samples of BC patients. The overall
success rate was near 100%. These urine cancer cell cultures (UCCC) provide a simple, non-invasive,
comfortable, reliable method to detect BC recurrence, and represent a living biomarker to predict patients’
response to chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Several cancer centers and laboratories including PI’s lab are
actively involved in clinical trials to validate clinical utility of the UCCC in BC clinics. Since a variety of patient-
context and collection, storage and transportation of urine samples to laboratories for cell cultures affect
enrichment and viability of cancer cells in urine samples, it is urgent needed to evaluate pre-analytical factors
of urine samples for UCCC and optimize these non-Invasive and living liquid biopsies as a routine approach in
monitoring recurrence and prediction of response of BC patients. In this application, we propose to address the
gaps by extending the work done by our team members on evaluating effects of sample processing protocols
on UCCC analysis, to further investigate effect of patient-specific context. In this application, we will first further
optimization of UCCC system to establish a culture kit for clinical applications, specifically we will optimize and
simplify conditions with co-culture kits, conditioned medium (CM), hypoxic condition for maximal efficiency and
robustness. Second, we will establish a Standard of Procedure - SOP- for urine collection and transportation in
clinics: we will test pH, temperatures, minimal cell number, a cocktail with anti-biotics and Y-27632 affect
UCCC cultures and success rate. Last, we will determine patient-context factors that affect UCCC cultures: we
will evaluate how urine timing (days before surgery, and after surgery, early morning, noon, night, drinking
water before urine collection, etc), urine volume affect cell viability and UCCC. Last, we will optimize a self-
sampling procedures for BC patients. The overall goal is to expedite UCCC clinical assay development through
evidence-based standardization of urine collection and handling practices, potentially approved by FDA as a
standard method for bladder clinics."
10815557,"Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) is highly prevalent in U.S. military service members and Veterans due to the impact
of joint trauma and overuse injury. Its socioeconomic impact is estimated at $60 billion per year, and no
disease-modifying treatments exist. Joint inflammation is linked to severity and progression of disease 4, but
current anti-inflammatory medications do not protect against progression, and have substantial side effects.
The purpose of this project is to develop and employ a novel method to modulate the local inflammatory
response in the joint after an injury in a sustained manner, to prevent post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA).
Specifically, we hypothesize that modulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation, via blockade of the
TLR co-receptor CD14, will reduce development of PTOA pathology and functional decline after knee
injury. We were the first to discover high levels of CD14 in OA patients and show that it augmented TLR-
mediated inflammatory responses. We have now demonstrated that genetic deficiency of CD14 reduces signs
of disability and prevents progression of cartilage damage in a murine model of PTOA; Our preliminary data in
this same model shows that pharmacologic blockade for therapeutic purposes is possible. We propose to
establish blockade of TLR co-receptor CD14 as an effective strategy to prevent PTOA pathology and functional
decline, using a large-animal (mini-pig) model of knee OA developed by our team. We will optimize intra-
articular (IA) delivery of a clinically developed CD14 blocking antibody to achieve sustained release during the
post-injury period, by encapsulating the antibody in innovative Mechanically Activated Microcapsules
(MAMCs). Finally, we will test whether TLR activation markers in Veterans with KOA can predict clinical
response to an existing anti-inflammatory therapeutic, with a focus on functional recovery, in order to optimize
patient stratification for future clinical trials of TLR-targeted anti-inflammatory therapies.
In Aim 1, Yucatan mini-pigs will undergo bilateral arthroscopic destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM)
surgery of both hind limbs. Starting one week after surgery, a neutralizing anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody
(Implicit Biosciences) will be delivered IA to one knee; the contra-lateral side will receive isotype-matched
antibody control. Functional outcomes will include activity and knee joint flexion angles measured every two
weeks using a wearable motion-sensor device. Synovial fluid (SF) and serum will be collected prior to DMM
and at endpoints for molecular/cellular analysis of effects of treatment. Groups of animals will be euthanized at
endpoints up to six months after surgery, and PTOA pathology evaluated using novel MR imaging techniques
allowing clinically-relevant early cartilage molecular changes to be detected, and imaging data will be validated
using standardized histopathology. In Aim 2 we will optimize encapsulation of anti-CD14 in MAMCs using
microfluidic double emulsion technology, and confirm sustained delivery of active drug after encapsulation
using in vitro and ex vivo analyses. Encapsulated anti-CD14 will then be delivered IA to one hind knee joint of
DMM-operated mini-pigs, and encapsulated control antibody to the contra-lateral side. A single dose will be
given one week after DMM. The effects of encapsulated anti-CD14 vs. unencapsulated anti-CD14 on
pathology and functional outcomes will be compared. Retention and distribution of MAMCs in the joint will be
assessed by IVIS imaging. Finally, in Aim 3, we will leverage the availability of SF samples from participants in
a VA-funded clinical trial (MOVE-OK study) testing the efficacy of IA corticosteroids in Veterans with knee OA.
Biomarkers related to TLR activity (including sCD14, sTLR4, LBP) will be measured in SF collected and stored
as part of the MOVE-OK protocol, using ELISA/multiplex assays. Associations between biomarker levels, and
change in activity levels and disability scores with therapy will be tested using linear regression analysis.
Pursuit of this project will result in the development of an innovative method to control joint inflammation after
injury, and inform patient selection for future clinical trials of TLR-targeted immunomodulatory approaches."

 TGF is an essential regulator of articular chondrocyte/cartilage homeostasis. However, reduced/absent
TGF receptor (Tgfbr2) expression with aging, joint injury, and in osteoarthritis (OA) prevents the use of TGF1
as a clinical treatment for OA. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to identify the key genes, pathways, and
potential therapeutic targets that are regulated by TGF1.
 Our preliminary data shows that TGF1 regulates chondrocyte homeostasis and anabolic biosynthesis
through stimulation of glucose uptake, glycolysis and anabolic Hexosamine Biosynthetic Pathway (HBP).
Specifically, we show that TGF, via TAK1 signaling, induces the HBP through upregulation of 3 key
genes/targets: i) Glut1, the major enzyme involved in glucose uptake; ii) Gfpt2 (glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate
amidotransferase-2, the rate limiting enzyme of HBP), and iii) Slc25a1, the key mitochondrial citrate transport
protein that provides a source of cytoplasmic Acetyl CoA necessary for production of UDP-GlcNAc. UDP-GlcNAc
is the terminal metabolite in the HBP pathway and is required for matrix synthesis of hyaluronic acid and
glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Our mass spectrometry (MS) data establish that TGF1 enhances the production
of UDP-GlcNAc and increases the proportion of carbons in UDP-GlcNAc derived from radiolabeled glucose.
Moreover, our RNA-seq data and additional in vitro data identify Igf1 as a critical downstream target of TGF1
since the induction of glucose metabolism, glycolytic gene expressions, glucose uptake, HBP, and proteoglycan
production is abolished in in TGF1 treated articular chondrocytes with Igf1r gene deletion. In contrast, Igf1
over-expression mimics the effect of TGF1 on glucose metabolism as well as cartilage anabolism and
homeostasis. Collectively, these novel findings indicate the existence of a TGF/IGF1 signaling axis in
chondrocytes, and that modulation of this axis may be a promising therapeutic strategy to treat OA.
 Two Specific Aims are proposed. Specific Aim 1 will define the upregulation of Hexosamine Biosynthesis
Pathway (HBP) as a key mechanism involved in TGF-mediated homeostasis of articular cartilage.
Complementary in vitro and in vivo genetic approaches targeting Tgfbr2, Tak1, Glut1, Gfpt2 and Slc25a1 as well
as HPLC-MS will be used to establish regulation of the HBP as an essential anabolic pathway necessary for
articular chondrocyte homeostasis. Specific Aim 2 will utilize Igf1r loss-of-function and Igf1 gain-of-function
models in vitro and in vivo to establish Igf1 signaling as a downstream effector of TGF regulation of glucose
metabolism and articular cartilage homeostasis. In summary, the proposed studies will define TGF/IGF1 as a
novel pathway axis in regulation of glucose metabolism, HBP, and articular chondrocytes homeostasis in the
context of OA. This work will enhance our understanding of mechanisms regulating OA and provide novel targets
for innovative therapeutic approaches."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) affects nearly 1 in 2 U.S. adults, is the #1 killer of men and women, burdens
disadvantaged groups, and has costs greater than any other condition. While these statistics highlight the
importance of CVD prevention, current approaches have only partial effectiveness. This has created a need to
identify new CVD prevention targets, their underlying mechanisms, and effective interventions. Insomnia, its
candidate mechanisms, and insomnia treatment are strong candidates in this regard. Thirty years of evidence
indicates that insomnia is an independent, clinically important, robust, and potentially causal and modifiable
risk factor for CVD. In addition, biologically plausible mechanisms that could explain how insomnia promotes
the development of CVD have been proposed, with the most strongly supported being systemic inflammation,
autonomic dysfunction, and metabolic dysregulation. Our recent RCT of adults with insomnia disorder provides
promising preliminary support for one such candidate mechanism. Adults randomized to cognitive-behavioral
therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), versus education control, had a reduced risk of high C-reactive protein (CRP), an
inflammation marker implicated in the pathophysiology of CVD and predictive of future CVD events, at follow-
up. Because insomnia now receives limited attention in settings where CVD prevention occurs (e.g., primary
care), there is a large cohort of patients with an unaddressed CVD risk factor (insomnia). This status quo and
the strong state of the insomnia-to-CVD science create the current need for a well-powered, mechanistic trial
to elucidate biological mechanisms underlying the insomnia-to-CVD relationship and CBT-I’s mechanisms of
action, both of which are presently unknown. Therefore, we propose a mechanistic trial of 200 primary care
patients (45% minority) with insomnia disorder and CVD risk factors but no clinical CVD. Patients will be
randomized to 6 months of the SHADES (Strengthening Hearts by Addressing DisruptEd Sleep) Intervention or
Active Control. The SHADES Intervention is our modernized collaborative care intervention consisting of well-
established internet, telephonic, and face-to-face CBT-I. Active Control consists of sleep education/hygiene,
symptom monitoring, and primary care for insomnia. Our proposal has four aims – Aim 1: determine the effect
of the SHADES Intervention on our primary CVD mechanism of high-sensitivity CRP; Aim 2: determine the
effect of the SHADES Intervention on our secondary CVD mechanisms of systemic inflammation, autonomic
dysfunction, and metabolic dysregulation; Aim 3: examine if 6-month improvements in upstream sleep
mechanisms mediate the SHADES Intervention effect on 6-month improvements in downstream CVD
mechanisms; ExploratoryAim: explore the effect of the SHADES intervention on proinflammatory gene
expression. The proposed trial would generate the critical support for the mechanistic rationale and conceptual
framework needed to justify the next-step phase III, multi-site RCT to determine the SHADES Intervention

 Chronic pain is a highly prevalent problem in our society, is associated with significant personal suffering,
and disability, and incurs billions of dollars in cost annually. Despite its highly negative impact this medical
problem remains a clinical diagnosis relying on patients’ reports of pain intensity and the clinician’s physical
exam. The availability of reliable biomarkers for chronic pain, which do not rely on clinical diagnosis and
subjective pain reports, will increase our understanding of the pathophysiology of different chronic pain
conditions, improve care by providing clinicians with tools to classify and follow patients, and help greatly in
clinical trials developing novel analgesics where subjective pain reports remain the primary tool.
 Neuroimaging results from our lab as well as others are starting to reveal reproducible brain signatures
of chronic pain involving changes in specific aspects of structural and functional cortico-striatal plasticity. As
such, we and others have shown that altered activity in, and functional connectivity between the nucleus
accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex, and loss of accumbens and dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex volume are
reproducible across laboratories and can potentially constitute an objective neural signature of chronic low back-
pain. However, it remains unknown whether this neural signature is generalizable to other musculoskeletal
chronic pain conditions like arthritis and/or chronic neuropathic pain like trigeminal neuralgia and/or chronic
affective conditions like major depression or is specific to CLBP. In addition, the effects of patients’ age and sex
on the neural signature of CLBP, which are major determinants of the clinical experience of chronic pain, remain
unknown. The overall aim of this application is to determine these two unknowns.
 In Aim 1 we will test the specificity of the neural signature to musculoskeletal CLBP by testing its
predictive accuracy in chronic knee pain from osteoarthritis (KOA), which is a different musculoskeletal pain
condition, in chronic pain from trigeminal neuralgia (TN), which is a neuropathic pain condition, and in major
depressive disorder (MDD), which is a chronic negative affective condition. To that end, we will use machine
learning techniques to train a predictive model and classify CLBP patients from healthy controls (i.e., training
set) using a priori defined brain features drawn from reproducible findings based on our work and on the CLBP
neuroimaging literature. Next, this model will be validated on a new sample of CLBP patients and healthy
controls (i.e., test set) and tested in KOA, TN, and MDD patients to assess generalizability to other chronic pain
or affective conditions or specificity to CLBP. In Aim 2 we will study how age affects the predictive power of the
neural signature of CLBP and test how robust are the group differences between CLBP patients and healthy
controls in the brain features making up the neural signature across young (18-30 years old) and older (> 50
years) age groups. In Aim 3 we will explore the effects of sex on the neural signature of CLBP following a similar
approach to the one used in Aim 2 but using instead a grouping based on sex."

Contemporary cohort studies and randomized clinical trials are regularly linked to
biorepositories and electronic health records systems. These secondary resources often
contain exposure and/or outcome data that are crucial for addressing novel study
questions. However, exposure/outcome ascertainment costs are often prohibitive. For
example, assaying biospecimen from biobanks to measure blood markers or manually
reviewing health records to accurately ascertain medical history information are both
costly and restrict sample size. A solution to high ascertainment costs is the two-phase
study that uses available participant information to identify those who are most
informative for addressing study questions. Restricted study resources are then
concentrated on the sub-cohort of informative participants. Outcome dependent and
outcome related sampling designs are examples of two-phase studies. They are highly
efficient compared to standard random sampling because they use outcome and/or
auxiliary variable data to identify the informative participants and then enrich the
observed sample with them. However, analyses must correct for the non-representative
sample. In this competing renewal, we propose highly efficient outcome dependent and
outcome related sampling designs as well as ascertainment correcting analysis
procedures for ordinal and longitudinal data. This is a natural extension of the research
conducted during the prior funding cycles which focused on longitudinal binary and
normally distributed response data. In the current proposal our focus is on generalized
ordinal (from a few ordered categories to non-normal, continuous) and longitudinal
ordinal responses, on novel semiparametric models, and on robust variations of
likelihood-based estimation strategies. Aim 1 regards outcome dependent sampling and
outcome related sampling designs and analysis procedures for scalar generalized
ordinal response data; Aim 2 regards outcome dependent sampling and outcome related
sampling designs and analysis procedures for ordinal, longitudinal data; and Aim 3
extends a new class of semi-parametric generalized linear models (SPGLM) to
correlated multi-outcome dependent sampling designs, to longitudinal data settings, and
then proposes outcome dependent sampling designs for longitudinal data."
10925228,"ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY
Substance Use Disorders (SUD, i.e., alcohol, nicotine, cannabis, opioid) and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
(PTSD) are prevalent, highly comorbid, and associated with a high public health burden. Further, the frequent
co-occurrence of SUD and PTSD has clinical implications, including greater symptom severity, poorer treatment
prognosis, and poor physical health, compared to either disorder alone. Thus, there is a great need to understand
their etiologic underpinnings to best inform prevention and intervention efforts. SUD and PTSD are both
moderately heritable, with correlated genetic risk demonstrated by twin studies. Recent advances in statistical
genetics have produced multivariate methods well suited for comorbidity applications that expand upon genetic
correlations to examine causality (i.e., Mendalian Randomization [MR]), and to boost power for identification of
disorder-specific and shared genetic risk (i.e., genomic structural equation modeling [gSEM]). Our work thus far
has focused on the genetic relationships of PTSD with alcohol use disorder (AUD), demonstrating a significant
genetic correlation between PTSD and AUD (rG=.35), and finding a support for a causal effect of PTSD on AUD.
While these findings provide clues for the relationships between PTSD and other common SUD, the genetic
relationships between PTSD with other SUDs, especially cannabis, and opioid use disorders remain relatively
unexplored. The first aim of this project is to harness the existing large GWAS samples brought together by the
Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) SUD and PTSD workgroups, to characterize the genetic relationship
between SUDs and PTSD using state-of-the-science statistical genetic techniques. Initial GWAS in the PTSD
and SUD workgroups have largely focused on broad phenotypes that are amendable for harmonization across
cohorts. Thus, there is an unfilled need for increased data acquisition and harmonization within the workgroups
to allow for more nuanced scientific questions about the PTSD-SUD relationship to be answered. For example,
it is unknown if the nature of the PTSD-SUD genetic relationship is influenced by trauma characteristics (i.e.,
age of onset, type of trauma), differs as a function of substance use versus disorder, and how genomic risk
unfolds in comorbid PTSD-SUD cases. The second aim of this project is to interrogate these more nuanced
scientific questions by expanding phenotyping within the PGC groups. Importantly, existing research is limited
by the under-representation of individuals of African and Latinx ancestry. The third aim of this project is to
increase inclusion of diverse participants within the PTSD and SUD PGC workgroups. We will determine whether
Aim 1 findings extend to populations of African and Latinx ancestry by integrating three large and diverse existing
studies with data on SUD, PTSD, and trauma, and build additional collaborations to increase diversity in the
PGC workgroups. The overarching goal of this proposal is to understand the genetic relationships between SUD
and PTSD while increasing representation of individuals of diverse ancestry in psychiatric genetics research."
10911080,"Approximately 200,000 veterans receive cancer treatment at Veterans Health Administration facilities. With
improving survival rates for many cancers, the deleterious long-term cardiovascular side effects of cancer
therapies have become increasingly apparent. For many of the cancers that frequently occur among veterans,
radiation therapy (RT) is an integral component of treatment. Despite improvements in the techniques used to
target RT to the cancer tissue, some radiation always reaches surrounding normal tissue. Endothelial damage
within the small blood vessels or “radiation endotheliopathy” has been postulated as a major cause of RT-
induced injury of normal tissue. Many post-radiation syndromes have been attributed to radiation
endotheliopathy. One of them is cognitive decline, which is estimated to affect as many as 90% of patients
after brain RT. Mechanistically, radiation endotheliopathy is believed to be initiated by mitochondrial injury,
leading to chronic oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction over a period of years. Thus, intervention at the
time of RT is likely critical for reducing radiation endotheliopathy and its sequelae, including cognitive decline.
The discovery of effective mitigators will require a unified view of the pathways by which RT-related
mitochondrial injury influences various steps in this progression; this has not been achieved to date.
 The objective of the proposed project is to identify the mechanisms by which mitochondrial injury promotes
radiation endotheliopathy, and to test whether protection from mitochondrial injury prevents adverse short- and
long-term effects of RT in small blood vessels. RT induces mitochondrial DNA damage, perturbs ATP
production, enhances the mitochondrial membrane potential, Ca2+ uptake and reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production. The mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) regulates Ca2+ uptake into the mitochondrial matrix and
was recently reported as being redox-dependent. Mitochondrial Ca2+ augments ROS production that promotes
further mitochondrial dysfunction. Thus, we posit that MCU in endothelial cells (ECs) drives a feed-forward
circuit with mitochondrial ROS that leads to long-term adverse effects of RT, including cognitive decline after
brain RT. Indeed, published data from our laboratory demonstrate that blocking mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is
sufficient to reduce mitochondrial ROS production and protect EC barrier function. Thus, our central
hypothesis is that MCU-mediated Ca2+ uptake by mitochondria is required for excessive ROS
production after RT, and thus for chronic mitochondrial DNA damage, blood brain barrier (BBB)
breakdown, capillary loss, and cognitive decline. This hypothesis is further supported by our strong pilot
data that inhibition of MCU in ECs during RT abolishes mitochondrial DNA damage in vitro and protects
against BBB breakdown in vivo. Our novel tools and assays put us in the perfect position to perform the
proposed study. These include genetic models in which mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake can be modeled selectively
in ECs, state-of-the-art radiation equipment, assays of microvessel dysfunction and behavior in vivo, and
innovative nanoparticle-based tools for selectively targeting ECs at the time of RT. Our aims are to 1. dissect
the mechanisms by which mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake drives endothelial injury by RT, 2. test whether
inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in ECs protects against RT-induced injury in vivo and 3.
determine the extent to which nanoparticle-mediated delivery of MCU inhibitors protects against RT-
induced EC injury.
 The rationale of our proposed studies is that an improved understanding of the mechanisms of radiation
endotheliopathy will enable the development of effective therapies. Upon its successful completion, we will
have established mechanisms by which MCU promotes mitochondrial injury after radiation, and how
endothelial-selective delivery of an MCU inhibitor might be implemented as a first step towards developing
effective mitigators of radiation endotheliopathy that will benefit our veterans."

 Project Summary/Abstract
In 2022, the KDA Produce Safety Program assumed fully state authority for Produce
Safety in Kentucky via the passage of a State Produce Safety Statute/Regulation.
Under the 2021-2026 Period of Performance, KDA intends to shift its efforts from
building a state program to that of full implementation of FDA’s national Produce Safety
Program. During the next 5-year Period of Performance, KDA aims to utilize this robust
regulatory foundation, along with fully executed, foundational program SOPs to fully
execute a robust Farm Inventory, Education/Outreach,
Inspection/Compliance/Enforcement, and Produce-Related Event Response foundation
towards the specific aim of assisting federal/state partners and Kentucky produce
growers in achieving Standards for the Growing, Harvesting, Packing, and Holding of
Produce for Human Consumption (21 CFR Part 112).
The overall health relatedness of this project is that of consumer and public health
protection by implementing specific goals/objectives in the Project Plan aimed at
minimizing the risk of serious adverse health consequences or death from consumption
of contaminated produce through the application of science-based minimum standards
for the safe growing, harvesting, packing, and holding of produce raw agricultural
commodities grown for human consumption. This cooperative agreement is for full
program execution directed towards grower education, technical assistance,
development of a verified inventory of covered farms and conducting prioritized
inspections of farms covered by the Produce Safety Rule. KDA and its sub-awardees
will continue to conduct education, outreach, and identification of covered farms. KDA’s
long-term objectives, specific aims, and key focus during 2021-2026 Produce Safety
CAP Grant Period of Performance seek to ensure that robust Administrative, Farm
Inventory, Regulatory Program Foundation, Education/Outreach, and
Inspection/Compliance/Enforcement systems are in place and fully executed in order to
advance Federal/State efforts for a nationally integrated food safety system (IFSS),
enhance produce safety in the Commonwealth and abroad, and achieve high rates of
compliance with FDA’s Produce Safety Rule and the state statute/regulation."
10778561,"Project summary. Host interactions play critical roles during infection with bacterial pathogens. For many
bacterial pathogens, type 3 secretion systems (T3SSs) mediate numerous interactions with the host. Host
interactions, in turn, regulate the activation of the T3SSs. Once activated, T3SS effectors are delivered into
host cells via pores in mammalian plasma membranes (translocons) that consist of two T3SS translocases.
T3SS effectors modulate host cells in ways that promote infection. We found that engagement of host factors
leads to specific conformational changes in the translocon that are required for activation of effector secretion.
We found that residues in the host cytosolic domains of the bacterial translocases reside at least transiently
within the pore channel. We found that Shigella OspB manipulates mTORC1, the mammalian central regulator
of cell growth and proliferation, leading to OspB alteration of cell proliferation during Shigella infection.
 We propose to investigate the mechanisms by which cellular interactions with natively delivered plasma
membrane-embedded Shigella flexneri translocons contribute to translocon activation prior to cell invasion,
with the goal of uncovering mechanisms of pre-invasion roles of plasma-membrane embedded translocons,
including the mechanisms of pore opening, activation of effector secretion, effector translocation, and
membrane ruffling. Additionally, we propose to plan to leverage our recent findings to determine the
mechanisms of OspB manipulation of mTORC1, specifically identifying mammalian substrate(s), characterizing
the mechanism of mammalian substrate cleavage, and interrogating the mechanism by which OspB
mammalian substrate(s) alter mTORC1 activity.
 Our overall goal is to determine how mammalian cell proteins and interactions modulate bacterial infection
and pathogenesis, specifically the activation of the T3SS, and how T3SS effectors interact with and alter
mammalian cells. Given the conservation of T3SSs and OspB among medically important bacterial pathogens,
it is highly likely that our insights will have broad implications for host-pathogen interactions more generally,
therefore be of considerable interest to the pathogenesis community."

A growing number of geographically diverse regions around the world report increasing rates of chronic kidney
disease of uncertain or unknown etiology (CKDu), a life-threatening condition not attributable to traditional
chronic kidney disease risk factors. Yet, the etiology of CKDu remains unclear and data are lacking on CKDu
progression, biological manifestations, genetic determinants, and risk factors that may explain regional
variations. To address these challenges, the National Institutes of Health has formed the Chronic Kidney
Diseases of UnceRtain Etiology (CKDu) in Agricultural Communities (CURE) Research Consortium. The
Consortium will develop a harmonized study protocol that can be implemented in multiple endemic regions to
understand the etiologies of CKDu and disease progression and to identify potential therapeutic targets and
public health interventions. RTI International and Boston University along with our partners from Harvard
University, National Autonomous University of Nicaragua, University of Colorado, and Stanford University,
propose to establish the CURE Research Consortium Scientific Data Coordinating Center (SDCC). The SDCC
will provide the leadership, infrastructure, and tools to unite the Field Epidemiology Sites, Renal Science Core,
Human Health Exposure Analysis Resource, and NIH into a cohesive whole by promoting consensus building
and collaborative decision making. The SDCC's role in cultivating a common research agenda is crucial to the
CURE Research Consortium's ability to implement ethical epidemiology research designs; common
approaches for data collection, and biological and environmental assessments; best practices for data analysis
and dissemination; and ancillary research studies. Specifically, the SDCC will support the Research
Consortium by accomplishing the following aims: (1) elucidate the likely multifactorial etiologies of CKDu
development and progression in endemic regions by integrating a classic case-control study with longitudinal
assessments of cases to assess factors for disease progression and controls to capture CKDu development;
(2) promote consensus building and foster collaboration and coordination by providing scientific leadership,
expertise in data science and robust analytical methods, and communication, logistical, and operational
support; and (3) enhance Consortium research efficiency, productivity, and scientific rigor by providing sound
study monitoring and oversight and establishing efficient data and specimen management systems using
relevant technology and data visualization tools. Together with a multidisciplinary team of Co-investigators, the
SDCC multiple PIs, Jill Lebov, PhD (contact PI), Marie Gantz, PhD, and Daniel Brooks, PhD, bring the
required scientific and organizational capabilities in Consortium coordination, project management,
epidemiology, biostatistics, data science, nephrology and kidney disease research, environmental and
occupational health, genetics, and ethical conduct of international research in resource-limited settings to
effectively manage the activities of the SDCC, the CURE Research Consortium, and the CURE Study."

Chronic kidney disease of uncertain etiology (CKDu) has reached epidemic proportions in Costa Rica’s
Guanacaste province (Chorotega region), where it has become a leading cause of premature death. CKDu has
a high burden among young, male agricultural workers, but women and children are also affected, and its
causes remain largely unknown. In response to the RFA for Field Epidemiology Sites for the Chronic Kidney
Diseases of UnceRtain Etiology in Agricultural Communities Research Consortium (CURE Consortium), we
propose to recruit, enroll and follow 400 participants with evidence of CKDu and 400 control participants for
comprehensive assessments of individual risk factors and contextual exposures for CKDu. We propose an
Epidemiology Field Center in Liberia, Chorotega region, as part of a collaboration among the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the University of Costa Rica and local nephrologists in the Chorotega region. Our
study design includes a large case-control study with nested substudies and state-of-the art exposure
assessment methods to identify risk factors and cause(s) of CKDu. We will conduct clinical assessments and
collect extensive biological and environmental/occupational samples and data. In addition to analysis of a wide
range of self-reported lifestyle/demographic, environmental, and occupational factors and environmental
measurements in the case-control study, we will conduct 1) a nested family study to assess familial
aggregation/genetic susceptibility; 2) a prospective study among controls of serial targeted and non-targeted
contemporary environmental/occupational chemical exposures (exposomics) measured in urine and drinking
water in relation to measures of acute kidney injury (AKI) and new-onset CKDu; and 3) a prospective field
study among a representative sample of controls employed in agriculture and construction to investigate
seasonal workplace exposures through repeat measures of targeted and non-targeted chemical exposures
(exposomics, including but not limited to pesticide, metals, and combustion products), assessed in urine and
via silicone wristband samplers, in relation to measures of heat stress-related AKI. We propose to assemble a
resource of sufficient breadth, depth and size to permit informative assessments of a wide range of risk factors,
including environmental/occupational exposures and health contexts, with sufficient power to identify one or
more causes of CKDu that could be targeted for prevention, intervention or policy."
10887540,"The need for treatment early in life has emerged as an unmet need in Pompe disease (acid maltase deficiency;
glycogen storage disease type II), a lysosomal storage disorder caused by acid -glucosidase (GAA)
deficiency that leads to the accumulation of lysosomal glycogen and debilitating weakness. Patients with
Pompe disease receive life-prolonging therapy with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) consisting of
recombinant human GAA; however, ERT fails to completely reverse symptoms including glycogen storage and
functional deficits. The lack of a complete response to ERT has stimulated the development of new therapies,
including gene therapy. Gene therapy development has largely overlooked the need for early treatment during
preclinical research. We propose to address the question of how gene therapy for Pompe disease can reverse
nervous system involvement through the following Specific Aims: 1) Translate genome editing that establishes
a stable depot for GAA to the liver early in life; 2) Evaluate personalized genome editing for the treatment of
Pompe disease early in life. Developing gene therapy in Pompe disease may provide benefits in comparison
with ERT, including the correction of skeletal muscle and enhanced quality of life. These Specific Aims will
address the need for treatment early in life in Pompe disease by developing genome editing, which will guide
the design of future clinical trials to develop highly effective genetic therapy."
10883694,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The highest teen birth rates in California are primarily in Latinx populations in the rural agricultural coastal
and central valley regions where distinct socioeconomic and social factors play a role in adolescent well-
being. These areas also constitute the core population growth areas in California. Nationally, sexually
transmitted infections (STIs) have increased substantially, with rates in California reaching epidemic levels
that exceed national rates. Half of these infections occur among youth aged 15 to 24. Intervening on
underlying social determinants of sexual health is central to addressing the persistently high rates of
unintended pregnancy and rising STI incidence in Latinx youth. Much of the research guiding sexual health
intervention approaches for US youth has been conducted in large urban areas, in which social determinants
such as concentrated disadvantage and neighborhood social cohesion have been shown to affect
adolescent health. However, understanding the unique underlying contexts that contribute to health
disparities among rural Latinx populations is vital to achieving substantive improvements in the health of
adolescents and young adults. The overarching goal of this study is to identify social environment influences
on sexual health among Latinx youth residing in an agricultural community as they transition from
adolescence to emerging adulthood (ages 18 to 21). We will accomplish this by extending a prospective
cohort study of approximately 600 Latinx youth recruited and followed since 8th grade (age 13), with high
retention (92% at 2 years). We propose to conduct four additional annual waves of follow-up, including
quantitative data collection, biological testing for STIs and pregnancy, and in-depth interviews. The Specific
Aims are: Aim 1. Examine the effects of social determinants in adolescence on unintended pregnancy,
STIs, contraceptive use, and use of reproductive health care services during the period of emerging
adulthood; Aim 2. Use a mixed methods approach to identify mediators of the effects of social determinants
on sexual health outcomes to elucidate modifiable targets for intervention in emerging adulthood; and Aim 3.
Estimate population intervention effects of social determinants and mediators on sexual health outcomes in
emerging adulthood. Our established infrastructure, strong community-engaged partnerships, and existing
cohort position us for efficient initiation, rigorous implementation, and synthesis of results across a total of
eight waves of follow-up. This will allow us to examine the timing and cumulative effects of social
determinants of sexual health, identify mediators, and determine the most impactful intervention targets to
decrease unintended pregnancy and STIs during the time when the highest rates occur. The focus on
emerging adulthood constitutes a high priority and often neglected developmental period, with opportunities
to address substantial gaps in understanding effective ways to support transitions to adulthood that promote
well-being and positive sexual health."

More than 3% of the population develops an enchondroma (ECA), a benign tumor in bone composed of cells
derived from the growth plate that can cause pain, deformity, and can be responsible for pathologic fractures.
Enchondromas can progress to malignant chondrosarcoma (CSA). Mutations in genes encoding isocitrate
dehydrogenase (IDH1 and 2) were identified in a large proportion of ECAs and CSAs. In our prior work, we
found that IDH mutations inhibit growth plate chondrocyte differentiation, and chondrocyte-specific conditional
Idh1 mutant mice develop ECAs. Mutant IDH uniquely produces the metabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), but
we and others found that blocking the production of 2-HG pharmacologically does not alter CSA cell viability.
While 2-HG has epigenetic effects that are likely important in tumor initiation, tumor maintenance must rely on
other factors. Since IDH plays an important role in in metabolism, associated metabolic changes could drive
the observed phenotype. We found high levels of glycogen in cells expressing a mutant IDH. Glycogen is also
found in proliferating and pre-hypertrophic cells of the growth plate. In our previous work, we found that
intracellular cholesterol biosynthesis was activated in IDH mutant chondrocytes and that it is also regulated in
the growth plate, and its activity corelates with glycogen levels. This raises the possibility that intracellular
cholesterol biosynthesis, which is activated by Sterol regulatory-element binding proteins (SREBP)
transcription, also regulates glycogen. Our premise is that glycogen is an important energy source for pre-
hypertrophic and hypertrophic growth plate chondrocytes and that glycogen stores are required to maintain the
neoplastic phenotype in ECA and CSA. We also propose that glycogen depletion can suppress the neoplastic
phenotype. In this proposal we will study what regulates glycogen in the growth plate, ECA and CSA, and
determine the function of glycogen in these growth plate and neoplastic chondrocytes.
To determine what regulates glycogen in the growth plate, ECA, and CSA, we prioritized genes known to
regulate glycogen that were differentially regulated in the growth plate and by IDH mutations. Protein
phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 3C (PPP1R3C) is one such gene which is differentially and interestingly,
contains SREBP binding sites in its promoter region. Our preliminary data suggest that SREBP regulates
PPP1R3C which then regulates glycogen. Our studies will use cell lines from human tumors and genetically
modified mice that develop enchondromas to define the function of glycogen and PPP1R3C in the growth
plate, ECA, and CSA. In addition, we will study how SREBP regulates PPP1R3C and glycogen. Glycogen
synthase will be deleted genetically, or we will cells with drugs that inhibit glycogen synthesis and breakdown.
This data will provide pre-clinical information on which to base novel therapies for ECA and CSA."

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is one of the greatest treatment challenges in
cardiovascular care today. Exercise is one of few treatments shown to benefit adults with HFpEF. Yet, to achieve
and sustain the benefits of exercise, adherence is required. Recent National Heart Lung and Blood Institute
(NHLBI) working groups on HFpEF and exercise in heart failure highlighted high priority areas for future study
including examining strategies and interventions to promote exercise initiation and adherence, testing
interventional mechanisms to improve adherence to exercise, identifying clinically meaningful outcomes for heart
failure trials beyond mortality, and examining longitudinal changes in inflammatory biomarkers to better
understand correlates to clinical status. Our team has successfully tested an intervention [Heart Failure Exercise
and Resistance Training (HEART) Camp] that significantly improves long-term adherence to moderate intensity
exercise (≥120 minutes of exercise at a heart rate reserve of 40-80%) in stable, chronic heart failure. Adherence
was moderated by ejection fraction and a secondary analysis of our HFpEF subgroup showed promising long-
term exercise adherence. We now propose a sufficiently powered randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy
of 2 interventions in achieving long-term exercise adherence in adults with HFpEF. Our overall objectives align
with NHLBI priorities and work toward achieving our long-term goal to promote adherence to exercise in HFpEF:
(a) evaluate the effects of theory-based training and coaching interventions on long-term adherence to exercise,
(b) identify minutes of moderate-intensity exercise that relate to clinically meaningful change in patient-reported
outcomes, (c) evaluate interventional mechanisms and interim clinical events as mediators of adherence
behaviors, and (d) examine the cost of intervention delivery. To meet these objectives, we propose a 3-group
randomized controlled trial to compare 2 interventions, HEART Camp (in-person) to HEART Camp Connect
(virtual) to each other and to enhanced usual care in adults with HFpEF. The proposed study incorporates several
innovations: 1. We are the first to: test the effects of behavioral interventions designed to promote long-term
exercise adherence in HFpEF using an objective measure of adherence, attempt to define a benchmark of
minutes of exercise needed to achieve a clinically meaningful change, and assess exercise intervention cost;
and 2. We incorporate technical innovations including a web application for real-time capture of exercise data,
an innovative analytic approach that examines the influence of interim clinical events on adherence, a HFpEF
algorithm and large-scale inflammatory assays. These innovations challenge the current paradigm and help to
reach new horizons in HFpEF science. Our approach, which combines well-studied theoretical mechanisms
delivered with virtual coaching and training tested against in-person coaching and training, will allow us to better
understand exercise adherence in HFpEF. This study will have a critical impact by lessening non-adherence as
a barrier to progress in the clinical care of adults with HFpEF through regular exercise training."
10848368,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Targeting brown adipose tissue (BAT) function to increase energy expenditure represents an attractive strategy
to treat obesity and the associated type 2 diabetes. BAT and the related beige fat express uncoupling protein 1
(UCP1), a mitochondrial membrane protein that uncouples respiration from ATP synthesis and promotes
thermogenesis. Paradoxically, UCP1 null mice are only obese when maintained at thermoneutrality, suggesting
the existence of alternative mechanisms of thermogenesis. Consistent with this notion, several UCP1-
independent ATP-consuming futile cycles have been identified in brown and beige adipocytes. However, the
relative contribution of these pathways to the regulation of whole-body energy metabolism remains unclear.
Our preliminary studies suggest that peroxisomes, organelles specialized for lipid metabolism, are involved in
an alternative mechanism of adipose tissue thermogenesis based on peroxisomal metabolism of branched chain
fatty acids (BCFA). Peroxisomes account for up to 20% of total cellular oxygen consumption. Peroxisomal
respiration, unlike mitochondrial oxygen consumption, is not linked to ATP synthesis and instead generates heat.
Monomethyl (mm) BCFA are synthesized via de novo lipogenesis using a precursor derived from catabolism of
branched chain amino acids (BCAA). Our results reveal that cold treatment increases the gene expression of
factors involved in mmBCFA synthesis and beta-oxidation in thermogenic fat. A thermogenic stimulus promotes
translocation of BCFA synthetic proteins to peroxisomes, the site of BCFA beta-oxidation. Upregulation of BCFA
beta oxidation raises the intracellular temperature in brown adipocytes and increases oxygen consumption rate
in WT and UCP1 KO brown adipocytes. Together, these results lead us to hypothesize that peroxisomes are
involved in a UCP1-independent mechanism of thermogenesis characterized by a futile process of BCFA
synthesis and beta-oxidation. Since de novo synthesis of fatty acids is a highly energy-demanding process and
peroxisomal beta-oxidation is not linked to ATP production, we further hypothesize that this futile cycle promotes
negative energy balance, leading to protection against obesity and insulin resistance. To test this hypothesis,
we propose two specific aims. The first aim will use biochemical, cell culture-based, and in vivo approaches to
implicate peroxisomes in a futile process of BCFA metabolism. The second aim will use loss-of-function and
gain-of-function mouse models of BCFA beta-oxidation to study its role in thermogenesis and whole-body energy
metabolism."

 O-linked b-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is a ubiquitous post-translational modification (PTM) in
mammals, decorating thousands of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. O-GlcNAc cycling is an essential regulator
of myriad aspects of cell physiology and is dysregulated in numerous human diseases, such as cancer, diabetes
and neurodegeneration. Despite this broad pathophysiological significance, major aspects of O-GlcNAc signaling
remain incompletely understood, including the biochemical mechanisms through which O-GlcNAc transduces
information. At the start of our project, several studies had shown that O-GlcNAcylation mediates protein-protein
interactions (PPIs) in processes as diverse as chromatin remodeling, deubiquitination and nuclear envelope
assembly. These results suggested that O-GlcNAc might signal through conserved modes of PPI. However, little
was known about either the structure or function of these intracellular glycoprotein-protein complexes.
 We hypothesized that mammalian “reader” proteins might exist and transduce O-GlcNAc signals. In the
first project period, we devised and deployed a method to identify proteins that bind specifically and directly to O-
GlcNAcylated peptides and proteins in vitro and in human cells. These include the 14-3-3 family, which are well-
known to bind to phosphoproteins. Our results indicate that 14-3-3 proteins may be signal integrators, mediating
the extensively documented crosstalk between O-GlcNAc and O-phosphate, with broad implications for
intracellular signaling. In addition, we identified and characterized O-GlcNAc-mediated PPIs among nuclear import
receptors, intermediate filament (IF) cytoskeleton proteins and ubiquitin E3 ligase complex components. Building
on these results, we will study a focused set of diverse model O-GlcNAc-binding proteins in the next project period.
This strategy will generate new insight into the functions of individual O-GlcNAc-mediated PPIs in particular cell
biological processes, while also providing a comparative perspective across reader proteins, allowing us to discern
general themes of O-GlcNAc-mediated PPIs at the biophysical, biochemical and physiological levels.
 The long-term objective of our work is to understand the principles, mechanisms and functions of O-
GlcNAc-mediated PPIs in mammals. In the next project period, we will advance this goal through three Specific
Aims. In Aim 1, we will define the biochemical scope and phenotypic effects of O-GlcNAc binding by 14-3-3
proteins. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of O-GlcNAc/nuclear transport receptor interactions in inter-organelle
trafficking. In Aim 3, we will dissect the functional importance of O-GlcNAc-mediated interactions in two model IF
proteins. We believe our proposed work will significantly advance the field of intracellular signaling both by
elucidating the mechanisms and functions of individual O-GlcNAc-mediated PPIs and by revealing conserved
biochemical principles of O-GlcNAc recognition across reader proteins."

Wildland fire disasters raged throughout the western US in recent years, continuing a trend for increasing
frequency and severity of such events driven by climate change. Smoke arising from these events covered
much of the continent, exposing over 100 million people. Wildland fires in the New Mexico region can cross
over regions of legacy mining contamination or nuclear development. Evidence from past fires in Los Alamos,
for instance, revealed significant elevations of arsenic, nickel, and cadmium in the urine from first responders.
We have further identified that wood obtained near abandoned uranium mine sites that have elevated uranium,
chromium, nickel and vanadium. Our recent studies with naturally-occurring wildland fire smoke (WFS)
exposures from the California October 2020 wildfires demonstrate clear neuroinflammatory outcomes in
otherwise healthy mice. Interestingly, however, after 20 days of exposure, cerebrovascular endothelial cells
exhibited an evolving phenotype, with signs of reduced inflammation, signifying an adaptation to the relatively
acute circulating inflammatory stimulus. There is a significant gap in knowledge regarding how environmental
stressors like WFS promote cerebrovascular inflammation, and even less appreciation for mechanisms
governing neuroinflammatory resolution. In the present renewal proposal, we will take what we have learned
from extensive field work on uranium mine sites in Laguna Pueblo and Navajo Nation, and return to more
precise, laboratory-based exposure systems to address pulmonary and neuroinflammatory risks of wood
smoke from metals-contaminated biomass obtained from these regions. Thus, in Aim 1, we will determine the
toxic influence of metals in biomass combustion inhalation. We hypothesize that wood obtained near
abandoned uranium mine sites, enriched with several metal contaminants, has a greater potency than similar
biomass fuels from non-impacted sites. In the 2nd Aim we will elucidate the role of endothelial adhesion
molecules in driving neuroinflammatory consequences of wood smoke inhalation. We hypothesize that
neuroinflammatory outcomes of woodsmoke are dependent on cerebrovascular expression of adhesion
molecules (e.g., ICAM-1, VCAM-1), induced by circulating factors following inhalation exposure. Lastly in Aim 3
we propose to delineate and accelerate the resolution of neuroinflammation after WFS exposures. We
hypothesize that neuroinflammatory resolution following woodsmoke exposure, from the standpoint of
activated microglia, is actually dependent on the effective recruitment of peripheral immune cells through the
neurovascular unit. We will thus ascertain mechanisms underlying the progression of neurovascular tolerance
to wood smoke inhalation, thereby identifying potential molecular foundations of vulnerability to long-term
consequences of repeated exposure. Furthermore, we will assess the value of pro-resolving lipid mediators in
accelerating the resolution, as a potential dietary or therapeutic strategy for acute WFS exposure."

Parasitic nematodes infect more than 150 million people worldwide and up to 1.3 billion
people benefit from preventative treatment annually. Many parasitic nematodes require
insect hosts for transmission to human hosts in their complex life cycles. We use a
genetically tractable nematode Pristionchus pacificus that is associated with insects as a
comparative model to study how diverse behaviors arise from a limited set of neurons.
Our proposed research addresses a fundamental question on how nervous systems
evolve to accommodate new behaviors, specifically how and which transcription factors
are required to designate the developmental fates of chemosensory neurons in host-
seeking behavior. We will use reverse genetics to target candidate transcriptional
factors, known as terminal selector genes, as well as inducible transgenes to knock
down neuronal function at the single cell level. We will also use forward genetics to
investigate unbiasedly which genes are responsible to switch the preferences for taste
and smell when the nematodes develop into reproductive adults or host-seeking
infectious larvae. A detailed understanding of how neuronal remodeling affects
chemosensation could reveal the basic blueprint for sensory neurons found in diverse
nematodes, which could inform ways to disrupt the transmission of parasitic nematodes
between insect and human hosts."

Vocal hyperfunction (VH) is associated with the most frequently occurring types of voice disorders. These include
benign vocal folds lesions (e.g., nodules and polyps) and dysphonia that occurs in the absence of concurrent
pathology (e.g., muscle tension dysphonia). Effective prevention and clinical management of these disorders
continue to be hampered by limited knowledge of the etiological and pathophysiological mechanisms that
underlie specific voice disorders within the broad range of those associated with VH. To address this need, this
Clinical Research Center brings together a multidisciplinary team of experienced investigators to pursue a
comprehensive program of research focused on hyperfunctional voice disorders. The central theme of the Center
is that the clinical management of hyperfunctional voice disorders can be significantly improved by attaining a
better understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of these disorders and then translating this knowledge
into new, more effective methods for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.
A central premise of this work is that multiple factors contribute and interact in different ways to cause and
maintain the various disorders linked to VH. The most important are associated with behavioral, sensorimotor,
environmental, psychological/emotional, physiological, and biomechanical mechanisms. The interdisciplinary
research program will focus on attaining a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental relationships
between these factors and the different manifestations of VH. Research at the Center is guided and coordinated
by a comprehensive theoretical framework for VH that clearly illustrates the key hypotheses that will be assessed
in a coordinated effort overseen by an Administrative Core and carried out by the four Research Projects and
Technology and Data Science Core. Projects will employ an innovative combination of laboratory studies of
sensorimotor and physiological mechanisms; physical and computational modeling of biomechanical, aero-
acoustic, and auditory-motor control mechanisms; and the use of improved ambulatory voice monitoring
technology to investigate potential etiological and pathophysiological mechanisms of VH associated with daily
voice use. A clinical trial will also assess the benefit of combining novel ambulatory biofeedback with evidence-
based voice therapy to treat VH. A significant strength of the Center will be a centralized multidimensional
database in the Technology and Data Science Core that receives comprehensive data from all of the projects
for all enrolled patients and healthy controls, thus greatly facilitating the integration of results across the projects
and magnifying the impact of the Center well beyond the sum of its parts.
This program of research in hyperfunctional voice disorders is unprecedented in terms of its scope, integration
of information across multiple domains, number of innovative concepts, and methods that are being
simultaneously developed and tested. Achieving the goals of this research program will significantly improve the
prevention and clinical management of these highly prevalent disorders."

The Clinical Research Center for the Improved Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Vocal Hyperfunction
(VHCRC) brings together a multidisciplinary team of experienced investigators to pursue a comprehensive
program of research focused on hyperfunctional voice disorders. The VHCRC consists of four research projects,
an Administrative Core (Admin Core), and a Technology and Data Science Core (Tech Core). The research
program will be conducted primarily by a consortium of three institutions: (1) Massachusetts General Hospital
will serve are the lead/primary institution for the VHCRC and includes the Admin Core, Tech Core, and Project
1 (Identifying physical and behavioral factors and mechanisms to improve detection and phenotyping of vocal

and (3) Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María will conduct Project 3 (Modeling biomechanical, aero-
acoustic and auditory-motor control mechanisms of vocal hyperfunction). Additional institutions involved via
subcontracts include Boston Medical Center, University of Waterloo, Clarkson University, and Emory University.
The Admin Core will provide overall administrative support and direction for the entire VHCRC. It will be led by
the Program Director (PD) with assistance from an Administrative Coordinator. Duties performed by the Admin
Core include 1) performing all financial functions related to the operation of the VHCRC, 2) overseeing and
ensuring compliance with all human studies regulations, 3) submission of annual progress reports to NIH, 4)
scheduling and conducting regular meetings of all of the investigators participating in the VHCRC to optimize the

consensus. In addition to regular meetings of the entire research team, the PD and PIs of all projects and cores
(with selected consultants as deemed necessary) will meet annually with an Advisory Committee of leading
experts in areas related to VHCRC projects. This Advisory Committee will be actively involved in the evaluation
and planning process of the VHCRC, including evaluating the scientific progress and optimizing strategies to

10829473,"Project Summary/Abstract
The Clinical Research Center for the Improved Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Vocal Hyperfunction
(VHCRC) brings together a multidisciplinary team of experienced and productive investigators to pursue a
comprehensive program of research focused on the study of hyperfunctional voice disorders. The Technology
and Data Science Core (Tech Core) is a critical component of the VHCRC and provides central services and
resources related to include procurement, setup, and maintenance of technology and equipment at the
Massachusetts General Hospital Voice Center (MGH Voice Center) and Boston Medical Center; data quality
checks and pre-processing; signal/image processing resources and services for all Projects; centralized
database management integrating data types from all Projects; statistical and machine learning services to all
Projects; and data sharing with Project collaborators and the broader research community.
The Tech Core is primarily housed at the MGH Voice Center and includes a state-of-the-art voice clinic, the
Voice and Speech Laboratory for vocal function testing, and the Laryngeal Surgery Research Laboratories for
technology development and ongoing device maintenance. The Tech Core will provide biostatistical consulting
expertise to VHCRC investigators through a subaward to the MGH Institute of Health Professions, especially
with respect to the analysis of longitudinal data, latent profile analysis (unsupervised clustering for subtyping),
structural equation modeling, and hierarchical linear modeling. The Tech Core also has a subaward to the MIT
Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory to provide advanced machine learning services
(supervised classification, unsupervised clustering, and deep learning) to VHCRC investigators. The VHCRC
will be greater than the sum of its parts because the Tech Core will increase project effectiveness by centralizing
labor-intensive database organizational tasks, retrieving and organizing data regarding standard clinical voice
assessment and treatment services for enrolled patients, performing advanced voice analysis, and managing
data quality through automatic and semi-automatic pre-processing of thousands of hours of ambulatory
participant data.
The Tech Core will effectively integrate data types obtained by all Projects into a centralized, multidimensional
voice database that will be organized, catalogued, and available to VHCRC investigators and the broader
research community. The Tech Core will coordinate the sharing of high-quality data in a timely manner and, in
conjunction with the Administrative Core, facilitate regular communication among all research teams to stimulate
ongoing research progress."
10874411,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects an estimated 10-15% of the U.S population and induces morphologic and
physiological abnormalities significantly impairing one’s quality of life and is the most common diagnosis of a
heterogeneous group of gastrointestinal disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI). The risk of IBS following an
acute gastrointestinal (GI) infection is approximately 9%, and has been linked to numerous bacterial, protozoan,
and viral infections. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 infection elicits a wide range of GI symptoms, including diarrhea,
nausea, and vomiting, with reports of acute GI symptoms occurring in up to 61% of patients. Initial studies have
shown persistent GI symptoms lasting up to 5-6 months post-acute infection in 40-44% of SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Given the scale of the ongoing pandemic and reports of chronic GI symptoms after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection,
determining how this pathogen will impact the incidence or exacerbate IBS symptoms, while playing a major role
in the development of post-acute SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), known colloquially as Long COVID, is imperative.
However, to date, there is a dearth of studies that have assessed the development of post-acute GI disorders
following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The Arizona CoVHORT, an ongoing, prospective, longitudinal study of the
acute and long-term impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection on adults, provides the critical extant infrastructure
required to efficiently investigate the health impacts of the pandemic. Using this cohort infrastructure, we propose
the following aims: (1) Estimate the incidence of IBS following SARS-CoV-2 infections compared to non-
infected participants. To determine the incidence of IBS following SARS-CoV-2 infection, we will employ data
from the Rome IV IBS diagnostic questionnaire to compare rates of new onset IBS among participants who
tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 to those who did not, while controlling for confounding factors such as age,
gender, and ethnicity comorbidities and concomitant stress at the time of infection. (2) Determine the role of
pre-existing IBS on the development and severity of PASC. We will follow IBS participants who reported a
diagnosis (1) prior to March 2020, (2) before a SARS-CoV-2 infection, and (3) those who report no history of
infection to determine their ongoing and long-term symptoms over 2-5 years, including assessment of risk factors
and confounders. (3) Establish mechanisms of IBS following SARS-CoV-2 infections including differences
in the fecal microbiome composition and function, the host’s anti-commensal immune response to the
fecal microbiome, and targeted/untargeted serum protein biomarkers among SARS-CoV-2 exposed and
unexposed, who do and do not develop incident IBS. We will collect blood and stool samples and employ
shotgun metagenomics, host-microbiome directed IgG-seq and IgA-seq, and high dimensional serum proteomic
arrays to explore novel mechanisms, phenotypes, and biomarkers associated with PASC-IBS. PASC will impact
the individual health of millions of Americans over the next several years, and to date, limited studies have
examined potential long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 on GI outcomes specifically."
10874071,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Race-related stress is a public health problem and known predictor of severe psychological symptoms in Black
Americans. While there is a strong link between race-related stress and adverse mental health outcomes, little
is known about the transdiagnostic mechanisms that explain how experiencing race-related stress can lead to
psychological symptoms and what interventions may target these mechanisms. Our scientific premise is that
race-related stress can lead to disproportionately allocating one’s attention to threatening stimuli (i.e., attention
bias to threat), a known predictor of stress-related symptoms, and that this attention bias to threat can be
modified by a brief, culturally-informed mindfulness intervention. We also posit that racial identity is a key
individual difference factor that can shape the degree to which race-related stress influences attention bias to
threat and the degree to which a mindfulness intervention mitigates these biases. We will recruit 200 Black adults
from the community who have experienced race-related stress to complete a lab study to target three specific
aims, which are to: 1) Use eye-tracking methods to examine if race-related stress (vs. non-race related stress)
leads to greater attention bias to threat, 2) Test if a brief mindfulness meditation (vs. neutral audio) reduces
attention bias to threat, and 3) Investigate if racial identity influences a) the effect of the race-related stress
manipulation on attention bias to threat and b) the efficacy of the mindfulness manipulation on attention bias to
threat. In addition, this project has a strong undergraduate training component designed to stimulate
undergraduate students’ interest in research and provide both hands-on experiences and comprehensive
mentorship needed for a successful research career.
Overall, this project fills gaps in the literature by investigating how race-related stress affects threat-related
attentional processes, whether such processes can be changed via a mindfulness intervention, and for whom
such an intervention is most efficacious. We do so using a novel manipulation of race-related stress, identification
of an objective psychological mechanism, reliable and precise assessment of attention bias using eye-tracking
methods, and experimental manipulation of mindfulness, thus, addressing current limitations in this research
area. Findings from this project will advance research on understanding and overcoming the pernicious
psychological consequences of racism. Developing nuanced understandings of how race-related stress affects
mental health and how it can be treated are vital steps in eliminating mental health disparities among historically
marginalized and underserved communities."
10874257,"Project Summary/Abstract
β-Barrels proteins exist in the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria, mitochondria, and
chloroplasts. These proteins are composed of a sequence of covalently connected β-hairpins.
Here, we propose to study the interactions of β-hairpin peptides with membranes, namely,
binding, folding, insertion, and self-association. In this process, we will develop a foundation to
understand the early steps of the interactions of β-barrel proteins in membranes, leading to the
test of formation of multimeric barrels from β-hairpins. In the long-term we seek to develop
methods for the design and folding of modular β-barrel proteins in membranes. The model we
have in mind is a small membrane β-barrel protein, which consists of four β-hairpins in one
polypeptide chain (eight strands).
In this project specifically, we propose to design shorter peptides, of about 20-30 residues, that
form β-hairpins, and to study their incorporation in synthetic lipid membranes. We also plan to
understand the rules that determine proper membrane insertion and assembly of these
peptides. The specific aims are to study the thermodynamics and kinetics of binding of β-
hairpins to membranes, their structure in water and in the membrane, their insertion and
orientation, pore formation, and the effect of lipid composition. Critical to these objectives is to
understand how the peptide sequence determines binding, insertion, and folding. These
studies are best performed in simple and easily controlled model systems, using biophysical
methods with designed peptides and model lipid bilayer membranes.
The study of folding of β-barrel membrane proteins, like that of membrane helical proteins, is
complicated mainly because of the unfolded state of the protein in solution, where the nonpolar
(hydrophobic) residues are exposed to water. Therefore, these proteins aggregate when
unfolded in water. One approach to keep the protein monomeric in aqueous solution is to use
detergents or denaturants. Instead, the idea here is to use small units—hairpins—that remain
soluble because they are small. This allows us to study the entire process, from binding from
aqueous solution to insertion, under equilibrium conditions, without co-solvent additives.
A designed modular β-barrel would open the opportunities for applications enormously. The
long-term idea is to engineer binding sites for small molecules, such as drugs, metabolites, or
metal ions, thereby adding and a function to these modular β-barrels, with a large health-
related potential set of applications. The modular nature will also allow the design of
heteromultimeric β-barrels, by combination of different hairpins. Surmounting cellular
membrane barriers, including intracellular compartments, is a major difficulty in the use of
antibiotics, in drug delivery, and in molecular therapy. This proposal addresses the initial steps
to the mechanisms required for a successful approach."
10876264,"Project Summary/Abstract
Up to 65% of adults aged 65 and over will lose their ability to independently ambulate during hospitalization
primarily because they were not engaged in walking during their stay. Loss of independent ambulation is now
identified as a hospital acquired disability and a significant patient safety concern. Older adults spend greater
than 80% of the time in bed during hospitalization and only engage in ambulation 4% of the time. Costs for new
onset disability in the United States are estimated to be 26 billion dollars annually to cover increased medical
and long term care needs. Having a recent hospitalization and restricted activity were strongly associated with
development of a new functional impairment in older persons. Although patient ambulation may fall within the
domain of multiple healthcare providers (nurses, physical and occupational therapy, and physicians), nurses
have traditionally been responsible for promoting and maintaining patients’ functional mobility. But nurses
infrequently ambulate patients due to multiple personal and organizational barriers that prevent them from
getting patients up to walk. Asking nurses to do more will not fix the harm that is being caused to hospitalized
older adults or mounting costs due to increased need for health care resources post discharge. Innovative
models of care are needed that address and overcome barriers that prevent nurses from walking older
patients. Pilot study results of our model of care, Mobilizing Older adults Via a systems-based INtervention
(MOVIN) have demonstrated statistically significant increases in patient ambulation and change in nursing
practice and unit culture, which have been sustained on the study unit for over 3 years. Our next step is to
conduct an RCT using an incomplete stepped wedge cluster randomization design across four adult medical
inpatient units in two hospitals. The overarching hypothesis of this project is that MOVIN will improve functional
outcomes for older adult patients by producing a change in nursing practice and culture of ambulation on
inpatient units. Specific aims are to: 1) test the effectiveness of MOVIN to improve functional ability of older
adult patients at discharge, and 1, 3, and 6 months post discharge; 2) test the effectiveness of MOVIN to
reduce healthcare utilization of older adults at discharge, and 1, 3, and 6 months post discharge; 2a) analyze a
return on investment of MOVIN based on program costs and health utilization measures across different
hospitals; and 3) measure change in nurse behaviors and unit culture and identify ongoing systems barriers
that impact translation of MOVIN across inpatient units and different hospitals. We propose to accomplish
these aims with the overarching goal of eliminating loss of independent ambulation in hospitalized older adults.
This proposed project has the potential to prevent development of physical disability (loss of independent
ambulation) and functional decline, improve overall quality of life for older adults during and after their hospital
stay, and decrease healthcare utilization. The proposed project has the capacity to be immediately translated
to other hospitals to improve care quality to older adults across the United States."
10851838,"SUMMARY – OVERVIEW
Transplantation has revolutionized the lives of patients suffering from organ failure. The design of modern
immunosuppression has employed a time-honored focus on controlling T cell-mediated responses. However,
current immunosuppressive therapies have suboptimal success rates and induce significant side effects,
including increased susceptibility to infections, metabolic toxicity, and cancer risk. Given the growing body of
evidence showing that innate immunity is also critical to alloresponse initiation and allograft survival, it is not
surprising that current immunosuppressive regimens do not achieve satisfactory long-term graft and patient
survival.
Recent work by this P01’s investigators has shown that trained immunity plays a vital role in allograft
survival. Trained immunity is a long-term increase in the functional responsiveness of innate immune
cells, which is maintained by epigenetic modifications and can be considered de facto innate immune
memory. On a systems level, we demonstrated that trained immunity is regulated and maintained by epigenetic
modifications in bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors, which consequently release trained innate
immune cells with augmented inflammatory and antimicrobial function. Our preclinical and clinical preliminary
data revealed a discrete causative connection between allograft transplantation, the induction of trained
immunity, systemic inflammatory response, and activated or amplified T cell-mediated alloimmunity.
Furthermore, we identified trained immunity as a compelling therapeutic target in mouse and non-human primate
heart allograft models. Based on these results, our central hypothesis is that trained immunity is a critical
mechanism that amplifies and sustains both innate and adaptive rejection responses and is therefore a
compelling clinical therapeutic target for achieving long-term allograft survival without requiring chronic
immunosuppression.
In this P01, we will address our central hypothesis by drawing on the expertise of authorities in the fields of
immunology and bioengineering. This multidisciplinary team of scientists and clinicians will work together to
i) understand trained immunity’s clinical relevance in kidney transplantation, ii) elucidate the mechanisms by
which trained immunity is induced and leads to organ rejection, and iii) develop bioengineering solutions for
diagnosing and therapeutically regulating trained immunity in transplantation.
We anticipate that, together, these highly interactive Projects will generate innovative new therapeutic strategies
to more effectively prevent rejection and potentially achieve immune tolerance. If successful, these studies could
impact the entire field of transplantation and provide insights that could also be highly relevant for bone marrow
transplantation and autoimmune disease."

Cold-induced thermogenesis (CIT) allows endotherms, including mammals, to maintain body temperature at
~37oC despite sometimes much colder ambient temperature. Pharmaceutical activation of CIT is being
investigated by many groups as a potential therapeutic approach to obesity. Despite decades of investigations
of CIT, however, how different fuels are burned during CIT, by which tissues, and to what extent, remains ill-
defined. We propose here to carry out a comprehensive quantification of systemic metabolic fluxes during cold
exposure in mice. These studies are enabled by the development by us and others of: (1) steady-state infusions
with non-perturbative amounts of heavy isotope-labeled fuels in live, awake, and ambulatory mice, allowing
precise quantification of whole-body fuel turnover and of relative contribution of each fuel to tissue oxidation
rates; and (2) acute kinetic studies to allow quantitative estimates of rates of tricarboxylic acid cycle turnover,
and thus of VO2, in individual tissues. Based on extensive preliminary data, we hypothesize that CIT is largely
fueled from fat stores, but that it is nevertheless critically dependent on anaplerotic carbohydrate sources,
provided by the liver, to sustain fatty acid oxidation. We will have 3 aims:
Aim 1: Comprehensive quantification of whole-body fuel turnover during CIT in mice.
Aim 2: Comprehensive quantification of fuel use in individual tissues during CIT in mice.
Aim 3: Test the role of carbohydrate flux in BAT during CIT."

 Lupus nephritis is one of the most severe end-organ manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus.
Immunosuppression, the cornerstone for treating this disease, is complicated by many adverse effects. Although
traditionally considered as a glomerular disease, up to 80% of lupus nephritis patients present with tubular injury,
and tubular injury is a better predictor of progression to end stage kidney disease than glomerular injury. This
identifies the renal tubules as a therapeutic target in lupus nephritis. The complex biological mechanisms that
underlie tubular epithelial cell injury in lupus nephritis remain, for the most part, obscure. We propose to provide
such a mechanistic understanding by leveraging our key novel findings.
 We have shown that iron accumulates in the tubular compartment of the lupus nephritis kidneys but not
in the glomeruli. Most of the iron recycling in the kidney is performed by proximal tubular epithelial cells, and
excess iron induces ferroptosis -- an inflammatory form of cell death characterized by high levels of lipid
peroxidation. Ferroptosis is mostly observed in the tubular segments of human and murine lupus nephritis
kidneys. We have found that the enzyme Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4), a
ferroptosis promoter, was increased whereas SLC7A11, a ferroptosis inhibitor, was decreased in lupus nephritis.
Additionally, human lupus nephritis serum induced ferroptosis in proximal tubular epithelial cells and this was
associated with inflammation and injury. Liproxstain-2, a novel ferroptosis inhibitor, blocked these outcomes.
 These data led us to hypothesize that iron accumulation in proximal tubular epithelial cells promotes
ferroptosis, propagates tubulointerstitial inflammation and worsens outcomes of lupus nephritis. We aim to test
this hypothesis using congenic mice deficient for ACSL4 (Acsl4PTEC-/-) and SCL7A11 (Slc7a11PTEC-/-) only in their
proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTEC). We will first investigate the resistance of Acsl4PTEC-/- and susceptibility of
Slc7a11PTEC-/- mice to ferroptosis using an inducible and a spontaneous mouse model of immune complex
glomerulonephritis, identify the downstream molecular pathways that block or lead to ferroptosis and follow the
outcomes of kidney injury. Using lupus nephritis patients and healthy controls, we will dissect the ferroptosis
inducing ability of whole and immunoglobin depleted serum on proximal tubular epithelial cells as well as test
novel ACSL4 inhibitors. Using purified cells from the same cohort of patients and controls we will block known
repressors of SLC7A11 and evaluate outcomes of ferroptosis and tubular pathology. Finally, we will evaluate the
in vivo therapeutic efficacy of Liproxstain-2 in two spontaneous murine models of lupus nephritis with existing
renal injury. These studies will identify novel mechanisms of proximal tubular epithelial cell injury in lupus
nephritis and support use of ferroptosis inhibitors as a novel adjunct therapy to reduce dependency on traditional
immunosuppressants."

 Physiological processes such as aging must arise from activities and events spanning multiple time
scales. Although important, the dynamics of these processes are difficult to measure and study. In multicellular
model organisms for aging, the freely living nematode C. elegans is among the best studied, and yet, most of
the aging studies are limited to simple outcomes such as lifespan and completely ignore the process through
which aging occurs. This limitation is in part due to the lack of economical and scalable technologies to acquire
detailed data during the aging process (recording behavior and neural dynamics on individual basis using
conventional approaches are very expensive); further, there has not been a well-established theoretical (and
computational) approach to model the aging behavior and make connections between short- and long-term
dynamics. The lack of these tools result in the very limited description and understanding of the mechanisms of
healthspan, even in excellent genetic model systems as C. elegans. The goal of this application is to define
behavioral states and dynamics in the aging process and examine the neural origins of the behavioral
dynamics. First, high-throughput experimental systems and robust computational pipelines will be engineered.
The tools will then be used to characterize short- and long-term behavior dynamics in aging, especially in
response to food availability that results in modulations of longevity and health. Models will be built to connect
the neural dynamics to behavioral dynamics, and the models will address whether it is modulations in neural
dynamics that lead to changes in behavioral states and different long-term physiological outcomes. The
proposed project is innovative, because it is the first time multi-scale behavioral dynamics is recorded in large
number of individuals and fully characterized using stochastic dynamical system models in aging process; it is
also the first time that behavioral dynamical models are connected to and explained by neural dynamical models.
The proposed work is significant, because of both the tools and insights it generates. Scientifically, the ability
to define internal states and understand the aging trajectory, especially with insights to the neural origin of the
observed dynamics under a variety of longevity-inducing conditions, will point to potential strategies to influence
healthy aging. Technologically, we envision that both the high-throughput behavioral recording platform and the
neural imaging pipeline will be useful beyond C. elegans, and that the theoretical and computational pipelines
can potentially be generalized to many other experimental systems, including mice, non-human primates, and
humans. The rich data set for aging behavior will also benefit other aging researchers."

 The purpose of this K01 award is to support research training and advance the career development of Dr.
Rebecca Delafield. Dr. Delafield’s long-term career goal is to establish an independent research program
focused on improving maternal health and health care outcomes for Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders
(NHPI). Research Plan: Maternal mortality and morbidity are increasing in the U.S. A recent study from Hawai‘i
found that NHPI accounted for 44% of the maternal deaths, although they make up only 25% of the state
population. Beyond this single study, NHPI maternal mortality is largely invisible. Federal agencies do not publish
maternal mortality rates of NHPIs. This void is exacerbated by a dearth of research on other major and more
common maternal health outcomes, such as severe maternal morbidity (SMM) (e.g., eclampsia and
hemorrhage). Yet, a small body of research suggests NHPI communities face obstacles accessing the
healthcare system and engaging with health care providers, which may compromise care in pregnancy. NHPI
women may also have unique cultural perspectives on childbearing which could mitigate or exacerbate these
challenges. To comprehensively address maternal health among NHPIs, research is needed to 1) assess critical
maternal outcomes for NHPIs 2) better characterize NHPI experiences, and 3) identify key factors related the
processes and quality of maternity care. There are two research aims: 1) Compare rates of SMM in NHPI women
to non-Hispanic white women by analyzing hospital discharge data from facilities in Hawaiʻi, Oregon, and
Washington. 2) Survey 300 NHPI women to assess patient-clinician relationship and communication factors
associated with high-quality person-centered care, perceived discrimination, and engagement in prenatal care.
Career Plan: This project will provide the candidate the mentoring and training needed in the areas of scientific
and statistical methodologies for small populations, community-engaged research and health communication to
achieve her long-term career goal and short-term objectives. The third (training) aim is: Complete a rigorous
training program to advance skills in small population health research and statistical methods, survey analysis,
and community-engaged research. The Mentoring Team assembled has diverse skills and extensive experience
in the areas of NHPI health, health disparities research, epidemiology, community-engaged research, health
communication, maternal and reproductive health. Training objectives will be met through relevant coursework,
mentored research training, bi-directional training with community-based partners, and hands-on learning
grounded in Pacific cultural traditions. The completion of these aims will provide the candidate the experience
and preliminary data needed to compete for R01 funding as an independent investigator and progress toward
her future goal of developing and testing a culturally-responsive and community-engaged multilevel intervention
to improve NHPI maternal and perinatal health."

Glaucoma is a group of neurodegenerative diseases marked by the loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and
their axons. It is characterized as the second leading cause of blindness in the United States with at least 3
million people affected. This number is likely to rise to 4.2 million by 2030 if no new therapeutics can be
developed. Astrocytes are recently gaining attention as therapeutic targets for neurodegeneration diseases.
They become reactive and play critical roles in glaucoma pathogenesis. Unfortunately, the underlying
mechanisms of reactive astrogliosis and its impact on RGC axons in optic neuropathies remain unclear. Primary
cilia are microtubule-based organelles on the cell surface that are known for detecting and transducing
extracellular cues to regulate cellular processes through a variety of signaling pathways such as hedgehog
signaling. Defective primary cilia are associated with numerous neurodegenerative diseases. In this project, the
candidate proposes to study cilia signaling in optic nerve astrocytes. A deeper understanding of astrocytes' role
could have significant implications for developing astrocyte-targeting therapeutics for glaucoma. The proposed
study will pursue the following aims: 1) whether primary cilia in astrocytes protect against RGC death in
experimental glaucoma mouse models; 2) the role of sonic hedgehog signaling in optic nerve astrocytes in RGC
death. Overall, insights from the study of cilia-associated sonic hedgehog signaling in astrocyte reactivity will be
applied to develop potential astrocyte-targeting treatments for glaucoma. The candidate’s overall career goal is
to understand the process of astrocytes that contribute to glaucoma and to characterize novel cilia-based targets
for neuroprotective treatments. The candidate has a deep background in primary cilia and retinal diseases and
proposes to obtain training in glaucoma because astrocytic cilia is rarely studied in the vision field. During the
K99 phase, the candidate will obtain training to increase her understanding of neuroscience research and single-
cell RNA sequencing technique. The PI will work with mentors Drs. Yang Sun and Yang Hu, together with
members of a Stanford advisory committee team. This proposal will dissect the molecular pathways underlying
reactive astrogliosis in glaucomatous optic neuropathies and develop astrocyte-targeting therapeutics for
neurodegenerative diseases."

Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) afflict more than 80% of schizophrenia (SZ) patients and are
treatment resistant up to 40-45%. AVHs increase the risk of suicidal, aggressive behavior,
reduced work attainment and impairment in specific cognitive domains. Considering that 25-50%
of persons with SZ are treatment-resistant (TR-SZ), there is unmet public health need to treat
persistent AVH in TR-SZ. SZ is a disorder with disruptions within corticostriatothalamic circuits
((CST) thus potentially amenable to modulation via Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). DBS-SZ may
hypothetically modulate AVH through its effect on projections from superior temporal gyrus (STG)
to basal ganglia (BG), via the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and mediodorsal nucleus of
the thalamus (MDN). There is evidence that the SNr-MDN-STG loop is dysfunctional in SZ and
lesions within this loop cause new onset SZ-like hallucinations. Modulation of the SNr-MDN-STG
loop could result in treatment of persistent hallucinations in SZ. In support of this hypothesis, we
have preliminary evidence that bilateral SNr DBS induces sustained remission of chronic AVH in
a TR-SZ patient and their improvement in a second patient. We hypothesize (Aim 1) that SNr
DBS decreases AVH measured by in-clinic BPRS, and at-home-Ecological momentary
assessment technique by at least 20% without serious adverse events when comparing baseline
to 60 weeks DBS stimulation. For more granular examination of DBS effect on AVH, we will use
in-clinic Auditory Vocal Hallucinations Rating Scale (AVHRS), and the Scale for the Assessment
of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) (Aim 1). A potential neural mechanism of SNr DBS modulation for
AVH might be restoring oscillatory activity in the SNr-MDN-STG loop. Abnormalities in γ
oscillations (30–100 Hz) of the electroencephalogram are ubiquitous in SZ. SNr recordings in
persons with SZ is uncharted, but low-γ oscillations have been recorded from the SNr in ketamine-
treated rats, a well-established SZ model--these are hypothesized to reflect cognitive and
sensory, rather than motor impairment. We hypothesize that AVHs in SZ are associated with
excessive gamma power in the SNr, and that these abnormal SNr gamma oscillations can be
targeted with bilateral SNr DBS resulting in reduced AVH. We will collect home LFP recordings
to assess changes in SNr LFP gamma power in DBS on vs off and explore if DBS-related
oscillatory changes correlate with AVH changes (Aim 2). Since AVH are associated with
impairments in saccadic eye-movements s, we will also explore if DBS-related oscillatory changes
correlate with saccadic impairments and their improvements Aim 2.)"

Sensory hair cells are required for balance function. Vestibular hair cell degeneration causes balance
dysfunction manifested as dizziness and vertigo. In mice, a limited degree of spontaneous regeneration
occurs in the utricle, a vestibular organ detecting linear acceleration. Moreover, addition of the
transcription factor Atoh1 robust enhances regeneration of hair cells in the mouse utricle, but
regenerated hair cells mature only partially relative to native hair cells. In preliminary experiments, we
have characterized a novel AAV-ATOH1 construct leading to regeneration of more mature hair cells in
the mouse utricle. With the long-term goal of regenerating human hair cells to restore balance function,
two major obstacles remain: 1) we have an incomplete understanding of the molecular signatures
of human hair cells, supporting cells and hair cell precursors, 2) adult human inner ear tissues
are not readily available to test promising therapeutics discovered in animal models.
 To overcome these obstacles, we have designed a surgical method to procure live utricles from
deceased organ donors who typically have normal auditory and vestibular function. We have begun
assembling their medical records, single-cell transcriptomes, and histologic sections of utricles. In
parallel, we have procured utricles from vestibular schwannoma patients undergoing surgical resection.
Here, we propose to increase the recruitment of organ donors and vestibular schwannoma patients
and delineate and validate the transcriptomes of hair cells, supporting cells, and hair cell precursors in
adult human utricles in these two cohorts (Aim 1). Furthermore, we will determine whether our novel
AAV-ATOH1 enhances hair regeneration and maturation in cultured human utricles (Aim 2).
 Another goal of this award is to further my career as an investigator and mentor in patient-
oriented research. To build on my previous experience in bench research and mentoring, this award
is designed to protect my time and help me gain knowledge and skills to 1) study human hair cell
regeneration and 2) mentor others pursuing patient-oriented research.
 In summary, we will apply state-of-the art technologies (single-cell RNA-sequencing, gene
therapy, bioinformatic strategies) to study vestibular hair cell regeneration in live human utricles. We
have assembled a team of collaborators and experienced mentors in patient-oriented research. At the
end of this 5-year proposal, we will have 1) delineated transcriptomes of human hair cells, supporting
cells, and hair cell precursors, 2) revealed whether novel AAV-ATOH1 enhances regeneration and
maturation of human vestibular hair cells, and 3) enhanced my ability to perform and mentor others in
patient-oriented research in sensory disorders."

 Craniosynostosis syndromes are a group of devastating developmental disorders characterized by
craniofacial abnormalities and strabismus, or eye misalignment. The most common craniosynostosis syndromes,
including Apert Syndrome, are associated with genetic mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (Fgfr2).
Strabismus in Apert syndrome patients is difficult to treat due to high surgical failure rates. Sadly, untreated
strabismus is closely correlated with amblyopia, vision loss, and significant functional and psychosocial
difficulties that negatively impact quality of life for patients.
 It is unclear how abnormal FGFR2 signaling is associated with strabismus in patients with Apert
syndrome. These patients have abnormal bony orbits and abnormal extraocular muscles (EOM) because of a
known Fgfr2 mutation; however, it is not well understood how abnormal FGFR2 signaling, abnormal bony orbits,
and abnormal EOM clinically manifest as strabismus. Previous research shows atypical EOM, specifically
smaller EOM and myofiber disorganization, in both human Apert patients and in the Apert mouse model.
 Scientific investigations will focus on identifying the contributing determinants that govern abnormal EOM
structure and function in Apert syndrome and the key factors that cause EOM disease using a mouse model for
Apert syndrome. EOM anatomy and function will be analyzed using MRI, histology, and muscle functional
studies. Mutant mice that only express the Fgfr2 mutation in muscle, muscle stem cells, bone, or innervating
neurons will be used to characterize the contributions of abnormal FGFR2 signaling in different tissues to altered
EOM structure and function in Apert syndrome. A novel gene therapy that specifically targets the abnormal Fgfr2

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and lethal form of brain cancer in adult, typically recurring after all
therapies including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. A major part of the problem is that GBMs employ
various mechanisms to suppress the host immune system, preventing the immune cells (e.g., cytotoxic effector
T cells) from destroying and removing cancer cells. It is believed that tumor cells release or signal suppressive
factors. Thus, a better understanding of the cellular and molecular crosstalk mechanisms between tumor and
immune cell types are needed to advance immunotherapeutic approaches against brain tumors. Notably, we
and others have reported that standard of care chemotherapy stimulates formation of primary cilia, an
organelle that is likened to both a cellular ‘antenna’ and transmitter. The presence of cilia predicts more
aggressive and treatment resistant GBM. We now show for the first time, in patient biopsies, that glioma-
associated immune cells extend processes that contact the tumor cilia and cilia tip, thus positioned to send
signals to or receive signals from GBM cells. Similar observations were made in intracranial GBM-bearing mice
where we detected juxtaposition of cilia with recruited immune cells. Notably, cilia disproportionately and
predominately associated with monocytic-MDSCs (M-MDSCs), a cell type with known T cell suppressive
activity. In contrast, T cells rarely juxtaposed tumor cilia and maintained greater distances away from ciliated
tumor cells compared to M-MDSCs. Our compelling data suggest potential mechanisms of crosstalk between
ciliated tumor cells and specific immune-suppressive cell types that promote tumor progression and therapy
resistance. Our working hypothesis is that GBM cilia are venues for mediating interactions with M-MDSCs,
and this interaction supports their T cell suppressive activity. The aims of our studies will determine 1) how
GBM cilia affect M-MDSC and T cell tumor infiltration and function, and 2) which immune cell types contact or
avoid ciliated tumor cells in human GBM. We will tackle these aims by immunophenotyping syngeneic murine
gliomas with or without cilia, and compare these findings to spatial profiling of the immune microenvironment
around ciliated tumor cells in GBM patient specimens. Successful outcomes will shed light on a novel cell-cell
interaction in the brain tumor microenvironment that may explain, in part, how tumor cells evade targeting by
the immune system."

Elucidating the etiology of lung cancer is interwoven with the identification of risk factors for the disease,
and is critical to advance prevention, and assist early detection of this lethal tumor. While smoking status
and aging are well documented key lung cancer risk factors, along with several additional risk factors
including certain environmental and occupational carcinogenic exposures, there is a gap in our knowledge
of other important causes of the disease including biological processes that may modify the impact of
exposures or be independent risk factors. Because DNA repair ability is key in avoiding mutations and
preventing cancer, and likely reflects multiple inherited and other influences, we have previously developed
a panel of three functional DNA repair blood tests, which directly measure an individual’s effectiveness at
repairing oxidative DNA damage by the enzymes OGG1, MPG and APE1. Using these tests in a case-
control study, we found that a low DNA repair score, calculated from the three tests, was strongly
associated with lung cancer in addition to and independent of smoking. This was recently replicated in a
second case-control study, suggesting that adding the DNA repair score to current lung cancer risk models
is likely to substantially improve risk prediction. The data so far is consistent with a causative role in lung
cancer, but because the findings are based on case-control studies, where disease bias cannot be ruled
out, persuasive evidence to support a role of a low DNA repair score in lung cancer etiology requires
demonstrating its ability to predict lung cancer in prospective cohort studies.
 Our goal is to examine the predictive ability of the DNA repair score for lung cancer in a nested case-
control study within a prospective cohort, namely the PLCO Screening Trial. DNA repair activity will be
measured in expanded T cells from PLCO pre-diagnostic cryopreserved viable whole blood samples of
current smokers and never-smokers who subsequently developed lung cancer, and will be compared to
samples from matched controls who did not develop any type of cancer, from which the ability to predict
lung cancer can be inferred. Further, DNA repair tests will be expanded with three new functional tests for
the DNA repair enzymes TDG, SMUG1 and NEIL1. Using a set of test samples received from the PLCO
Trial, we have demonstrated that T cells could be effectively and efficiently expanded from whole blood
samples cryopreserved for 12 or 20 years, and were suitable for measuring all six DNA repair enzyme
activities, yielding reproducible values comparable to fresh lymphocytes. A successful outcome of this
study will support the role of sub-optimal DNA repair of oxidative DNA damage in the etiology of lung
cancer, and will facilitate the adaptation of the DNA repair score into clinically-validated biomarkers for risk
assessment of lung cancer. This is expected to improve risk estimates, and provide better selection criteria
for early detection of lung cancer by methods such as low-dose CT.

Gestational duration and birth weight are primary indicators of pregnancy outcomes. They are associated with
perinatal morbidity and mortality and also with childhood and adult disorders. In the past several years, we have
made substantial progress in the genomic research of gestational duration and birth weight. First, we conducted
large-scale genome-wide association (GWA) studies and identified six maternal genomic loci associated with
gestational duration, and 190 maternal or fetal loci associated with birth weight. Second, we developed statistical
methods to dissect the maternal and fetal genetic effects on birth outcomes. Third, we have studied the causal
relationships between maternal phenotypes and birth outcomes as well as the life course associations between
birth outcomes and late onset disorders. Despite these successes, there is a major gap in previous genomic
studies – they usually targeted either gestational duration or birth weight separately albeit these two birth
outcomes are statistically correlated and biologically related. To bridge this gap, we – the leading investigators
who previously focused on either gestational duration or birth weight separately – have committed to work
together and integrate the genomic research of gestational duration or birth weight. We propose a novel statistical
approach to jointly model the maternal and fetal genetic effects on gestational duration and fetal growth.
Specifically, we will 1) use birth weight as a surrogate for gestational duration and leverage UK Biobank birth
weight data for more powerful GWA discoveries of genomic loci associated with gestational duration; 2)
disentangle and replicate maternal and fetal effects by integrated genomic analysis in mother/infant duos; and
3) integrate genomics and phenomics to resolve the complexity of birth outcomes and their links with late onset
diseases. These cohesive study aims transcend conventional GWA studies and the results generated from this
study will increase our knowledge of the biology of human birth timing and fetal growth. This study also has the
potential to inform preventative and therapeutic measures for preterm birth and adverse pregnancy outcomes."

The prevalence of both obesity and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have increased, and each is associated
with adverse perinatal outcomes including fetal overgrowth, neonatal morbidity, hypertensive disorders of
pregnancy, and cesarean delivery. Women with GDM who are also overweight and obese have higher rates of
pregnancy complications when compared to normal weight women with GDM, which may occur in part due to
suboptimal glycemic control. The current recommendations for glycemic targets in pregnant women with
diabetes are not rigorously defined, and they far exceed the mean fasting (70.9 ±7.8 mg/dL) and 1 hour post-
prandial (108.9 ± 12.9 mg/dL) glucose values in pregnant women without GDM. Our prior work demonstrated
that use of intensive (fasting <90, 1 hr post-prandial <120 mg/dL) compared to standard (fasting <95 mg/dL, 1
hr post-prandial <140 mg/dL) glycemic targets resulted in improved glycemic control without increasing the risk
for hypoglycemia. The Intensive Glycemic Targets in Overweight and Obese Women with Gestational Diabetes
Mellitus: A Multicenter Randomized Trial (iGDM Trial) is a large, pragmatic randomized clinical trial designed to
investigate the impact of intensive versus standard glycemic targets on perinatal outcomes in women with GDM
who are overweight and obese. During the 5-year project period, a multidisciplinary team of investigators from 4
medical centers representing regions of the U.S. with high rates of obesity will randomize 828 overweight and
obese women with GDM to either intensive or standard glycemic targets.
The specific aims of this project are: 1) Determine the effectiveness of intensive glycemic targets in reducing the
risk for neonatal composite morbidity and large for gestational age birthweight in overweight and obese women
with GDM, 2) Assess the safety of intensive glycemic targets as measured by the frequency of maternal
hypoglycemia in overweight and obese women with GDM, and 3) Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of intensive
glycemic control compared with standard glycemic control as measured by the incremental cost per case of
neonatal morbidity and LGA birth weight prevented and per Quality-adjusted Life-year. The expected outcome
of this study is high-quality evidence on the effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness of intensive glycemic
targets in reducing adverse perinatal outcomes among overweight and obese women with GDM. If proven
effective, use of intensive glycemic targets in overweight and obese women with GDM will have an important
positive impact on the health of these high risk women and their infants."
10642741,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cachexia is defined by abnormal loss of body weight and muscle mass that occurs secondary to chronic
diseases, such as cancer. It is estimated that musculoskeletal complications affect up to 80% of patients
diagnosed with cancer, dramatically impacting patient survival. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel
treatments for cachexia-related musculoskeletal symptoms. Our recently published observations showing that
cancer cachexia can present with bone loss, even in the absence of direct metastases to bone, suggest that
tumor-derived soluble factors may play a critical role in the onset of such skeletal phenotype. In this regard, our
preliminary findings suggest that receptor activator of NFkB ligand (RANKL), a factor involved in osteoclast-
induced bone resorption, plays a causative role in cancer-associated musculoskeletal complications.
In our published and preliminary studies we found that patients affected with ovarian cancer present cachexia,
as well as elevated RANKL and CTX-I, a marker of bone resorption. Similarly, mice bearing ES-2 ovarian tumors
present with muscle and bone loss, along with high RANKL and bone resorption, also consistent with high
positivity for the osteoclast marker, TRAP, as well as dramatic osteocyte death. Contrarily, mice carrying C26
tumors, characterized by low RANKL expression, substantially maintain their bone mass, despite evidence of
muscle wasting. Interestingly, myotubes exposed to recombinant RANKL undergo atrophy, similar to mice
infected with AAV-RANKL or bearing C26 cells overexpressing RANKL, whereas the use of anti-RANKL
neutralizing antibodies preserves myotube size in C2C12 myotubes co-cultured with ES-2 cells and counteracts
bone and muscle loss in ES-2 tumor hosts.
The objective of this proposal is to define the mechanisms by which RANKL-expressing tumors participate in
bone and muscle loss in cachexia. Our central hypothesis is that tumor-derived RANKL participates in the
activation of bone resorption, and triggers mechanisms adversely affecting muscle mass. In Aim 1, we will
determine the effects of tumor-derived RANKL on bone loss in the absence of bone metastases. We hypothesize
that tumor-derived RANKL directly activates bone resorption. In Aim 2, we will elucidate the mechanism(s)
responsible for RANKL-induced muscle wasting. We hypothesize that activation of the RANKL/RANK-dependent
pathway in skeletal muscle is sufficient to induce atrophy and exacerbate cachexia. In Aim 3, we will validate
antiresorptive therapies to preserve muscle size and function in mice bearing RANKL-expressing tumors. We
hypothesize that tumor-derived RANKL, along with IL-6 consequential to bone resorption, negatively impact
muscle.
The findings from the proposed studies will define the mechanistic effects of RANKL in cachexia and identify
RANKL as a new therapeutic target for the treatment of musculoskeletal complication associated with non-
metastatic RANKL-expressing cancers. These results will also open new avenues for cachexia research."

10833638,"Tendon injuries heal in a fibrotic manner via chronic deposition of excessive, disorganized extracellular matrix.
Myofibroblasts are a critical driver of fibrosis in many tissues, and emerging evidence demonstrates
myofibroblast heterogeneity. That is, myofibroblasts with unique molecular profiles that correspond to changes
in myofibroblast function. Importantly, the fibroblast lineage from which myofibroblasts are derived also plays a
major role in dictating myofibroblast function. However, very little is known about myofibroblast dynamics
during fibrotic tendon healing, including their fibroblast/tenocyte-lineage, how their functions change over time,
what the molecular profiles of these different myofibroblast subtypes are, and how myofibroblasts interact with
other cells, such as macrophages, to mediate healing and fibrosis. We have identified Scleraxis-lineage and
S100a4-lineage cells as the predominant myofibroblast precursor populations during tendon healing.
Interestingly, depletion of S100a4-cells impairs early tendon healing, while Scx-cell depletion improves late
tendon healing suggesting these cells may give rise to functionally distinct myofibroblast populations. In
addition, our preliminary data identifies macrophages as a critical driver of the tenocyte-myofibroblast
transition, and we observed prolonged macrophage presence during late healing, concomitant with NFB-
mediated pro-survival signaling in myofibroblasts. These data are consistent with a pro-fibrotic feedback loop
between macrophages and myofibroblasts to sustain fibrosis in many tissues. Thus, in the present study we
will use a murine model of acute tendon injury and repair to rigorously define tenocyte lineage-specific
contributions to myofibroblast fate and define myofibroblast heterogeneity during healing. We will test the
central hypothesis that inhibiting macrophage-mediated myofibroblast differentiation and NF-B-mediated
survival of lineage-specific myofibroblasts promotes regenerative tendon healing. We will test this hypothesis
through the following specific aims: Aim 1: Define the temporal and tenocyte lineage-dependent
immunophenotype of myofibroblasts during fibrotic tendon healing. Aim 2: Establish the requirement for
extrinsic macrophages in fibrotic healing via modulation of the tenocyte-myofibroblast transition and test the
translational potential of inhibiting macrophage recruitment. Aim 3: Demonstrate that disrupting myofibroblast
survival or macrophage persistence inhibits sustained fibrosis and promotes regenerative tendon healing.
Successful completion of these studies will establish myofibroblast lineage, molecular profile and activation
mechanisms over time during fibrotic healing and define disruption of persistent myofibroblasts and
macrophages as a novel means to improve tendon healing."

 As a urologic oncologist, most of my peers have focused on operating as much as possible
with the hope their efforts could positively effect change on an individual level. During my NCI
Urologic Oncology Fellowship, I was drawn to the power of clinical discovery working alongside
clinical investigators. A surgeon has limited research paths to create paradigm shifts in the field
beyond the operating room, as industry often ignores many of the critical questions facing us.
Fortunately, the NIH Cooperative Group network trials provide an avenue for clinical scientists to
impact the field by interacting with likeminded individuals, patient advocates, translational
researchers, statisticians, and operational staff. By early engagement in SWOG, I have been
afforded the opportunity to participate and lead several clinical trials before taking larger roles in
translational research initiatives. This cemented my passion as a clinician scientist hoping to lead
new initiatives in kidney cancer. I am fortunate to have assumed Co-Chair responsibilities within
SWOG’s Renal Subcommittee and the NCI Renal Task Force. These leadership roles allow me to
imprint the next generation of clinical trials. This also includes my involvement with a small renal
mass trial aimed at reducing overtreatment, that was developed through a Clinical Trials Planning
Meeting by much of the Renal Task Force and has been prioritized within SWOG this year with
plans for GU Steering Committee review later this year. Despite receiving academic and leadership
recognition, my engagement in NCI clinical research throughtrial participation, administrative
efforts, mentorship of SWOG investigators, protocol development, and travel for bi-annual
meetings, there is limited institutional support at UCLA for these endeavors. Similarly, the NCI
sponsored trials have resulted in a financial burden to staff and this investigator, as compared to
industry trials. Participation has largely been a result of my passion to provide patients an
opportunity for improved care. The R50 Research Specialist Award mechanism recognizes the
critical role that individuals can play to advance clinical science and can significantly advance my
work. In particular, the financial support associated with this Award will further my engagement
in available NIH protocols, provide time for protocol development including our new Small Renal
Mass Concept, provide the means to travel to SWOG and Renal Task force meetings, and allow
designated protected time that SWOG and Renal Task Force leadership requires. This Award
would be instrumental in my academic career development during a time where the is increasing
pressure to produce clinically. I am thrilled for this opportunity and appreciate UCLA recognizing
my efforts with this nomination."
10815554,"The long-term aim of this project is to develop a stem cell-based approach to regenerate the function of damaged
auditory cells and synaptic connections. Our previous application focused on hair cell regeneration using stem
cell-based epigenetic approaches. The major objectives of this renewal proposal are to determine the molecular
mechanism critical for mouse hair cell synapse formation during normal development and develop a novel stem
cell-based approach to reinnervate mouse auditory hair cells. Hair cell regeneration has obtained significant
progress. Compared to hair cell regeneration, spiral ganglion neuron (SGN) regeneration has been reported but
with relatively limited results. We have identified a stepwise method to guide mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs)
to differentiate into ESC-derived SGN-like neurons (ESNs) that showed SGN features. Up to date, only a few
reports show that stem cell-derived neurons can form neural contacts with mouse hair cells. However, whether
these neural contacts are bona fide SGN-hair cell synapses remains unclear. The function of these neural
contacts has not been determined at the synaptic level. The molecular mechanism critical for regenerated
neurons to functionally reinnervate hair cells remains obscure. Therefore, there is a critical need to use ESNs to
reinnervate hair cells and determine the molecular mechanism critical for reinnervation. EphrinB family proteins
bind to the EphB receptors, a family of transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases. EphrinB signaling is involved
in a variety of developmental programs, including synaptogenesis. Previous studies show that EphrinB1
signaling is critical for excitatory synaptic induction. Our preliminary data suggest the role of EphrinB signaling
in ESN-hair cell reinnervation. Based on previous and our preliminary data, we hypothesize that EphrinB
signaling may play a critical role in regulating neurons to form functional synapses with sensory hair cells. To
test this hypothesis, three complementary specific aims are proposed. Aim 1 will determine the role of neuronal
Efnb1 in SGN-hair cell synapse formation during development. Aim 2 will determine the molecular mechanism
of ESN-hair cell reinnervation. Results of Aims 1 and 2 will guide the design of hair cell synapse regeneration
research. In Aim 3, we will determine the extent to which EphrinB1 regulates ESN-hair cell reinnervation.
Completion of this proposal will determine the molecular mechanisms critical for stem cell-derived neurons to
reinnervate sensory hair cells. Identifying the role of Efnb1 in hair cell reinnervation will guide the synapse
regeneration research, which will be translated into clinical trials to treat hearing loss patients. Therefore, the
outcomes of this work will open new avenues to explore a stem cell-based multidisciplinary approach to
regenerate hair cell synapses and restore the hearing function of Veteran and civilian patients."

Mathematical modeling is an essential tool to study the brain, behavior and cognition. Computational cognitive
models state with simple mathematical equations how the brain may be manipulating information that supports
how humans and animals interpret the world around them, make choices and adapt to new environments or
events. Researchers can use computational cognitive models to quantitatively test the theories embedded in the
models, by comparing model predictions with behavioral and neural data. Models also often have meaningful
parameters that can be tuned to reﬂect how speciﬁc information is used, for example how much participants
weigh prospective gains vs. losses in decisions, how willing participants are to explore new information vs.
exploit the information they already have, or how conﬁdent they need to be before committing to a decision. In
the context of psychiatric and neuro-degenerative diseases, computational modelers can ask whether models ﬁt
patients' behavior/neural activity differently than healthy controls, thereby explaining impairments as a difference
in information processing; or whether they exhibit different parameters for the same models, showing different
weighing of information. Thus, computational modeling provides important quantitative tools to understand how
brain disease impacts behavior and cognition.
 However, such research requires statistical tools to quantitatively relate models to data - that is, to identify
which models and which parameters explain the data best. Existing tools mostly rely on computing the likelihood
of the data under the model, and are very powerful for a speciﬁc class of models. However, they leave out a
much broader class of models for which the likelihood is too complex to compute. This class of models includes
many simple and relevant models that embody reasonable theories of cognition, but these models are currently
unexplored, because researchers lack the tools required to relate them to data. The goal of this proposal is to
develop new tools for this class of models, using modern supervised machine learning techniques (with deep
neural networks) that bypass the need to compute the likelihood, but do not require advanced expertise in ap-
plied mathematics and are broadly generalizable to the whole class of models that are currently inaccessible to
existing techniques. Speciﬁcally, we will develop tools to 1) identify which of multiple models explain a partici-
pant's data better, 2) identify the value of model parameters that best explain a participant's data, and 3) infer
how the model variables generated the participant's behavior, enabling us to relate these variables to brain data.
 This research will vastly increase the potential reach of computational techniques in neuroscience, enabling
researchers to consider theories that are currently discarded for lack of tools. This is an important step toward
broadening our understanding of mental illness and brain diseases."

All vector-borne flavivirus NS5 proteins suppress host type I interferon (IFN) signaling, which is critical to
successfully infecting humans and causing disease. Inhibitors of this function of NS5 or viruses engineered to
lack this activity may be effective antiviral therapies and attenuated vaccines, respectively. However, a deeper
understanding of how the flavivirus NS5 protein acts to suppress IFN is needed. Despite the importance of
inhibiting IFN signaling, and the high degree of sequence conservation between NS5 proteins within this genus,
flaviviruses have evolved numerous distinct ways to antagonize this innate immune response. Many flavivirus
NS5 proteins, including those of dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), and yellow fever (YFV) viruses, inhibit the Signal
Transducer And Activator Of Transcription 2 (STAT2) protein, which is a transcription factor that mediates IFN
signaling. In this application, we propose to fill critical gaps in our understanding of the ZIKV NS5-STAT2
interface by defining the essential viral and host genetic determinants for this interaction at the highest possible,
single amino acid, resolution through deep mutational scanning (DMS). In Aim 1, we will screen libraries of all
possible single amino acid ZIKV NS5 variants for the ability to suppress IFN signaling. We will examine these
determinants in a range of flaviviruses to understand functional conservation and mechanisms. In Aim 2, we will
identify how STAT2 genetics impact the ability of ZIKV NS5 to suppress IFN signaling and mediate infection.
Finally, in Aim 3 we will define how ZIKV NS5 induces the degradation of human STAT2 by identifying the STAT2
sites where NS5 induces ubiquitination and the host factors ZIKV NS5 recruits to mediate this modification. The
results of this project will provide in-depth insights into flavivirus host cell interactions and replication mechanisms
that may aid in the development of therapies for ZIKV, and could perhaps be further applied in combating other
future virus outbreaks."
10834262,"Per year, globally an estimated one million children develop tuberculosis (TB) and more than 15 million
children are estimated to be exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). The case fatality rate is high in
children < 5 years of age. Current approaches to diagnosis and management of young children that are close
contacts to a TB case are inadequate. Those that are symptomatic may undergo sputum-based diagnostics
that are not well tolerated (eg gastric aspirates), require access to a reference laboratory, and are not
sensitive because TB may be paucibacillary or extrapulmonary. For that reason empirical multidrug anti-TB
treatment predominates in many locales. Management of the asymptomatics is sub-optimal as well. Given
the poor performance of IGRAs and TST in this age group, most are treated with isoniazid preventive therapy
(IPT). In adults, asymptomatic (subclinical TB) is at least as common as active TB and will not be detected
by current symptom-based screening. We do not know how often this is the case in exposed children,
however, IPT, would be inadequate in them. Further, about 19% of children in this age group with latent TB
infection (LTBI) will progress to active TB, usually within the next 3-6 in the absence of IPT (and IPT is only
63% effective). The need therefore is to discover a biomarker or biomarkers that identify those children < 5
years of age with subclinical TB (likely to progress despite IPT); and those without subclinical TB that are
likely to progress. These biomarkers would allow appropriate targeting of IPT and ATT to those likely to
benefit. This consortium of investigators have on-going diagnostic and cohort studies of child (< 5 years of
age) close contacts of TB cases in Uganda that include a rigorous bacteriologic reference standard applied
to asymptomatic as well as symptomatics and evaluation of novel diagnostics and discovery of non-sputum-
based approaches. We propose now to evaluate in children < 5years old that are close contacts of a TB
case a diverse and complementary panel of bacterial, host-based and imaging non-sputum biomarkers that
have shown promise as predictors of progression in adults. Further, we will discover relevant biomarkers in
this population through an unbiased multi-omics approach using proteomics, single-cell omics, T-cell
activation markers, antigen-specific antibody profiling, Mtb exosomal assays, computer-aided detection
(CAD) for chest X-ray interpretation and point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS). Our goal is to characterize a
biomarker or group of biomarkers that meet a minimal target performance profile to identify children with
subclinical TB and/or at high risk of progression. We will apply advanced machine learning and integrative
multiomics to identify combinations of these biomarker signatures alongside TB risk variables to improve
precision of predicting progression. These results will provide novel approaches to risk-stratify children <5
years of age for targeting the administration of preventive therapy and ATT."

High-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) arises from malignant primitive cells that are resistant to current
therapies. These cells exhibit a growth benefit in the MDS microenvironment and their elimination is challenging
due to the lack of targetable markers distinguishing them from healthy primitive cells. We found that men with
MDS and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) have worse survival and higher disease burden in their primitive
cells compared to women. To shed light into these sex differences, we evaluated the expression of known
androgen receptor (AR) target genes in MDS/MPN samples. We found that one of the top AR-regulated genes,
CCRL2, is overexpressed in primitive cells from MDS patients. CCRL2 is an atypical chemokine receptor as it
lacks G-protein binding domain, is internalized via endocytosis and its C-terminal region is required for its surface
localization. Our published results showed that CCRL2 induces MDS growth and activates JAK2 highlighting this
receptor as a potential target in MDS. CCRL2 knockdown suppresses growth-related pathways, most
prominently transferrin receptor (TFRC) and E2F targets. However, as CCRL2 lacks signaling domains, the exact
mechanism is unclear. We hypothesized that CCRL2 interacts with TFRC in early endosomes and activates it
while CDK/E2F is regulated by CCRL2 via JAK2. We also hypothesize that CCRL2 C-terminal region is essential
for its oncogenic properties. We found that CCRL2 deletion sensitizes MDS cells to azacitidine, the most
commonly used MDS therapy. Inhibition of JAK2, a CCRL2 target increases azacitidine efficacy in CCRL2 wild-
type but not in CCRL2 knockdown cells. Thus, JAK2 may mediate the CCRL2-regulated azacitidine resistance.
This also suggests that targeting other CCRL2-regulated pathways can be selectively effective against CCRL2-
expressing cells. Thus, we hypothesize that inhibition of CCRL2-regulated pathways or agents suppressing
CCRL2 levels are toxic against CCRL2-expressing cells and can increase azacitidine efficacy. In Aim 1 we will
confirm the induction of TFRC growth-related activity by CCRL2, define JAK2 role in CCRL2-mediated growth
pathways regulation and determine the involvement of CCRL2 C-terminal region in its growth effects by
performing immunofluorescence, proteomics, and CCRL2 gene editing. In Aim 2 we will confirm the implication
of JAK2/STAT in the CCRL2-mediated azacitidine resistance and discover other agents with selective efficacy
against CCRL2-expressing cells by performing drug and CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens. Selected agents will
be combined with azacitidine in an inducible-CCRL2 MDS xenograft model. These studies will provide the PI the
opportunity to gain critical skills and expertise to study the molecular biology of MDS growth with emphasis in
the role of CCRL2 and discover novel targeted therapies for this disease. These objectives will be accomplished
through formal coursework, scientific programing, and direct mentorship by experts in molecular genomics,
pharmacology and computational biology. The proposed career development plan and research aims will provide
a pathway to a career as an independent investigator studying MDS/MPN molecular biology."

Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is increasingly used for non-malignant hematologic

which is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis of BO in adults depends on
spirometry, and evidence suggests that early diagnosis may improve chances of recovery of
lung function and survival. Small children, and even older children and teenagers who feel
unwell and are uncooperative, are unable to perform spirometry, meaning that lung impairment
is “invisible” until severe and clinically manifest. Progress in improving lung outcomes of HSCT
in children has been hindered by lack of diagnostic strategies, and by the need for a large group
of cases to allow testing of biological, pathological and diagnostic hypotheses to advance the
field. We propose assembling a prospective cohort study of all children receiving HSCT at 6
major US transplant centers. We will perform standardized prospective testing of lung function
and clinical data collection in all children in the cohort, to determine the frequency, clinical
phenotypes and risk factors for BO (Specific Aim 1). BO is a rare disease so progress will not
be made absent a multi-center cohort study that uniformly defines clinical phenotype and
prospectively collects samples, allowing retrospective study of early molecular events that
predict later disease. In Specific Aim 2 we will collect calendar and event-driven biological
samples, including serum, plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and bronchiolar lavage
fluid, which will be stored and used to identify biomarkers of onset of BO and of response to
therapy. Moreover, we will collect pathological samples that will be analyzed using a pre-
existing rare lung disease pathology platform to identify genetic and anatomic changes that
define BO. Lastly, in Specific Aim 3 we will test and disseminate novel lung testing strategies,
including innovative imaging, to address the critical clinical challenge of late diagnosis of lung
impairment in children. We provide examples of essential biological studies that can only be
performed using the resources of the cohort, for which we will seek additional R01 funding.
Taken together, this cohort study can fundamentally change the paradigm of lung injury after
transplant and provide a platform for testing preventive and therapeutic treatments."

Following smallpox, several other infectious diseases including measles, polio and rubella have been targeted
for eradication. However, elimination of these latter infections has proven challenging. While mass vaccination
has halted endemic measles transmission in most of the Americas, with similar high vaccination rates, measles
continues to cause large epidemics in some parts of the world. Further, these epidemics can spread to other
regions due to high global connectivity and reduced local vaccine coverage (e.g. the recent increases in measles
cases in the US). These observations indicate that current understanding of disease persistence in complex
population systems remains incomplete and must be improved to effect eradication of infections such as
measles. To improve this understanding of disease persistence, the proposed work will develop model-Bayesian
inference systems using mathematical modeling and statistical methods to identify the spatial, temporal, and
demographical factors contributing to the persistent transmission of measles in the mass vaccination era. A
range of hypothesized transmission mechanisms will be tested, including changes in i) vaccination rate, ii)
demographics (e.g. birthrates and age structures), iii) contact pattern, iv) spatial connectivity and migration,
and/or v) strength of maternal immunity. Further, the project will test potential intervention measures based on
the identified transmission mechanisms as well as generate predictions of future measles epidemic dynamics to
inform measles elimination efforts. By leveraging detailed measles surveillance data, infectious disease
modeling, and Bayesian inference methods, the proposed work will yield new understanding of measles
transmission dynamics in modern populations and provide model-guided intervention strategies. Project findings
may also inform control strategies for other infections targeted for eradication (e.g. rubella). In addition, the
model-inference systems developed here can be adapted to study a broad range of (re)emerging infectious
diseases."
10899563,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In the long-term, our goal is to understand how single cells integrate and process information to make irreversible
decisions such as whether to proliferate, differentiate or die. Inflammatory factors that participate in many normal
and diseased cell fate decisions initiate signals by dynamically re-organizing proteins within the cell. For
example, ligand-bound TNF receptors transiently organize large protein complexes near the plasma membrane,
and these are visible within the cell as discrete punctate structures, whereas other proteins translocate between
cellular compartments such as the cytoplasm and the nucleus. It is an emerging principle that dynamic properties
of molecules within signal transduction circuits provide temporal codes (including rate of change, amplitude,
duration or frequency among others) that are critical to each cell’s response to stimulus. Given that there is
substantial cell-to-cell heterogeneity, even in clonal cell lines, static measurements at fixed time points cannot
reveal the mechanisms of dynamic information processing. We hypothesize that components of the same
signaling pathway are deterministically linked to one another in a single cell, even though there is substantial
heterogeneity between cells. Here, we propose to multiplex expression of live-cell fluorescent reporters for up-
and down-stream components of the same signaling pathway in the same cell, and correlate time-varying signals
from live-cell microscopy data. We will also multiplex expression for reporters between pathways predicted to
have crosstalk. Using a hybrid of quantitative imaging, robot-controlled cell cultures, and computational
techniques, we will extract time-varying data from single cells in a broad range of experimental condition that
reflect what cells may encounter in vivo. We will also compare cellular responses across different inflammatory
factors that share signaling modules and converge on the NF-κB transcriptional system, and we will learn how
immune and cancer cells communicate these signals in co-cultures and higher-dimensional cellular structures.
Using a rich single-cell dataset, we will identify emergent properties of signal transduction, and infer transfer
functions that connect signaling mechanisms and correlate with cell fate. Data from live-cell experiments will be
incorporated into mechanistic models to formalize our understanding of how information is relayed through the
signaling network into transcription, and suggest perturbations to test predicted mechanisms. We anticipate that
increasingly accurate models may lead to non-intuitive strategies to manipulate decisions in single cells. Through
a detailed understanding of how dynamic molecular signals encode, process, and decode information, we have
the potential to understand biological problems that are deeply rooted in disease, and use this knowledge to
rationally design therapies that impact cell fate decisions."
10877944,"SUMMARY. The problem: Hormone therapy remains the standard treatment for prostate cancer (PC). While
most patients initially respond to therapy, they will ultimately progress to lethal castration-resistant PC (CRPC)
within 6 to 12 months. During progression, canonical sources of androgens are replaced with mechanisms that
trigger PC growth, even in the absence of hormones, making therapy at this stage very difficult. Proposed
solution: We will utilize a newly discovered biological function of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)
to develop an entirely new personalized therapeutic strategy for PC that is significantly different from existing
therapies. High levels of PSMA are seen in most aggressive forms of PC and are a predictor for progression.
However, the biological role of PSMA remains unknown. Our proposal is based on our recent paradigm-shifting
discovery that PSMA provides a so far unknown oncogenic signaling function, where its enzymatic activity
triggers an intricate intracellular signaling repertoire, promoting cancer growth through activation of the
Pi3K/AKT/mTORC-1 as well as the mTORC-2 signaling cascades. Having charted the interface of PSMA with
the main biological signaling cascades in PC, we provide here a novel therapy that disrupts these major signaling
pathways. Importantly, inhibition of PSMA led to a survival benefit in mice. We developed in parallel a companion
imaging assay to diagnose and monitor PC with a cheap and facile ex vivo bioluminescence-based assay from
readily available samples. In this assay glutamated luciferein (GluLuc) is cleaved specifically by PSMA to release
luciferin that can be detected by luciferase in urine/prostatic secretions with a bench top assay system. We have
already evaluated this assay in mice and patients and have shown that it is superior to the gold standard of PSA
levels. Here, Aim 1 will focus on our companion imaging assay. We will measure luciferin released by PSMA in
expressed prostatic secretions urine (EPS/U) or urine and correlate the bioluminescence signal with local and
metastatic tumor burden and growth. Aim 2 will explore inhibition of PSMA as therapy for PC as monotherapy or
in combination with androgen inhibition. Since inhibition of PSMA activity will lead to reduced release of luciferin,
we will correlate the reduction of signal with the tumor response. We will repurpose PSMA inhibitors, with a
proven safety profile for CNS disease that were abandoned due to low CNS penetration. In Aim 3, we will explore
if PSMA inhibition can be used as therapy of CRPC and to prevent metastasis formation. We will also test if it
can delay onset of castration resistance. As in Aim 2, we will monitor therapy with the benchtop assay. Tumor
growth will be interrogated with MR and PET imaging Our work is significant, as it charts an entirely new path
for PC therapy based on the specific biological function of PSMA. The underlying biology of PSMA is highly
innovative, as it has never been explored in spite of its significant biological consequences. Furthermore, we
also demonstrate an innovative, facile, and inexpensive ex vivo benchtop approach to diagnose, monitor PC and
monitor therapy. Ultimately, this will benefit all patients with PC, particularly those with CRPC."
10811703,"This competing continuation proposal extends and deepens a productive program of longitudinal research on
suicidal behavior in a cohort of 303 people with borderline personality disorder (BPD) with a prospectively
ascertained high risk for serious suicide attempts. Our studies in 2017-22 focused on the pathway from
interpersonal experiences to suicidal behavior, integrating three timescales: naturalistic prediction of suicidal
behavior over years; prediction of suicidal ideation over days; and experimental interrogation of decision
processes over minutes. Taken together, our findings show that the emergence of suicidal ideation from
interpersonal conflict is catalyzed by internalizing psychopathology, whereas the transition to suicidal behavior
is facilitated by externalizing psychopathology and neurobehavioral alterations in decision-making. Building on
this work, we propose to (1) examine interpersonal traits and specific facets that cause decompensation in
BPD and facilitate transitions in the suicidal process on a timescale of years, (2) improve individualized
prediction of emotion dysregulation and suicidal thoughts on a timescale of hours to days, and (3) advance a
neurocomputational account of the failed search for solutions in a crisis on a timescale of minutes. For
continuity, we retain the historic focus on BPD as a prototypical personality disorder, yet we also emphasize
dissociable contributions of multiple underlying internalizing and externalizing dimensions to the suicidal
process. Our team has complementary expertise in suicide research (Dombrovski, PI), borderline personality
and experience sampling (co-investigators Hallquist and Wright, and consultant Pilkonis), decision
neuroscience (Dombrovski and Hallquist), and quantitative methods including machine learning (Hallquist and
Wright, with consultant Jacobson joining now). We began leading the study in 2017, boosting recruitment, and
quadrupling the number of publications compared to 2012-17. Proposed innovations include a focus on
clinically salient facets of interpersonal traits, integration of intensive and extended EMA with passive sensing,
an investigation of dynamic decision-making under high cognitive load supported by an original computational
model, and a recently developed and validated multi-level approach to fMRI analysis. Clinically, understanding
the suicidogenic effects of interpersonal trait facets and elaboration of personalized models of suicide risk will
advance suicide prediction and development of just-in-time interventions. Expected results will advance the
field of suicide research by unifying conceptual models of the suicidal process with hierarchical dimensional
models of psychopathology, identifying general vs. person-specific suicidogenic processes, and elucidating
decision-making under cognitive demands representative of the suicidal crisis. In line with the NIMH’s
prioritized research agenda on suicide, this work will address mechanisms of suicide risk, while investigating
RDoC’s reinforcement learning and limited capacity constructs and thus bridging RDoC with hierarchical
dimensional models of psychopathology."
10792956,"Memory impairment is a core, disabling feature of schizophrenia, yet we lack effective treatments. A major
limitation of efforts to understand and treat memory impairment is that memory is generally assessed during a
single session. This approach misses the critical, and arguably most important, aspects of memory that happen
offline, outside of conscious awareness, during both wake and sleep. Over the past 20 years, a virtual explosion
of research has produced a wealth of evidence of an evolutionary conserved function of offline processes in the
consolidation of multiple forms of memory, with wakeful rest and sleep playing complementary roles. This basic
work has revealed the importance of off-line memory consolidation to cognition across the lifespan and its
mechanisms, most notably the central role of the hippocampus. Yet this mechanistic knowledge has not been
translated to the clinic: hippocampal physiology has largely been neglected as a treatment target. This is the
unmet medical need that the present proposal addresses. Our laboratory has established that people with
schizophrenia show a deficit in sleep-dependent memory consolidation. And our preliminary data show a
correlated deficit in offline learning during wake. Converging evidence from human and rodent studies show that
both types of offline learning depend on hippocampal sharp-wave ripples and associated memory replay.
Schizophrenia is characterized by structural and functional hippocampal abnormalities that would be expected
to disrupt ripples. The primary goals of the proposed research are test the hypotheses that disrupted
hippocampal ripples in schizophrenia impair offline learning and can be treated using closed-loop auditory
stimulation during sleep (CLASS). CLASS is a novel noninvasive neurostimulation technique that can be
implemented at home. First, using archival data, we will establish that schizophrenia patients have correlated
deficits in offline memory during wake and sleep, consistent with a common underlying mechanism. Next, in a
mechanistic trial of CLASS, we will determine whether by repeatedly synchronizing sleep oscillations over a
hippocampal-prefrontal cortical network, CLASS can strengthen hippocampal-prefrontal interactions and
improve offline memory in schizophrenia. Finally, by studying epilepsy patients with direct hippocampal
recordings, we will definitively link ripples to offline learning. During wake, we will show that ripples increase
during the rest breaks that follow learning and correlate with performance gains. During sleep, we will show that
CLASS increases the ripple coupling with slow oscillations and spindles that is critical for sleep-dependent
memory consolidation. By studying memory during both wake and sleep, this research program will reveal
parallel mechanisms of consolidation in these distinct states. It will both augment our basic understanding of the
role of the hippocampus in offline memory and translate this mechanistic knowledge to improve memory in
schizophrenia. Given the lack of effective treatments for disabling cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, the impact
of CLASS as a scalable, mechanistically guided, effective treatment for memory loss would be substantial."
10874753,"7. Project Summary/Abstract
Gliomas have a low survival rate of 36% at five-years, half the average survival rate across all cancers
according to the last SEER and CBTRUS reports. Malignant brain tumors cause on average 20 years of
potential life lost (YPLL), exceeding most cancers. Survival and YPLL have not improved for gliomas as in
other cancers and urgent progress is needed. Recent studies showed maximal surgical resection extends
survival of glioma patients. However, glioma margins are ambiguous on conventional anatomical imaging, and
neurosurgeons are in great need for more specific imaging to map tumor boundary. Gliomas have large
metabolic alterations, most notably D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), cystathionine and nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations. Imaging metabolism using proton (1H) and
phosphorus (31P) magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) has high specificity for glioma. Mapping
tumor margins requires high resolution, which is challenging for metabolic imaging. Our project addresses
neurosurgeons’ need for high resolution metabolic imaging. Recent discoveries highlighted metabolism role in
modulating epigenetic factors, gene expression and immune system responsible for tumor progression. Hence,
new treatment strategies target metabolic pathways to increase the effect of chemoradiation and
immunotherapy to prevent tumor resistance and relapse. Metabolic imaging can accelerate clinical trials of
novel therapies, and its development has been mandated by the last neuro-oncology consensus (SNO,
EANO). The long-term goal of our research is to create non-invasive metabolic cancer imaging tools for
personalized precision oncology. The objective of this application is to develop fast high-resolution whole-brain
quantitative metabolic multinuclear MR imaging for image guided therapy of glioma patients. The central
hypothesis of our proposal is that multinuclear MR imaging will enable clinicians deliver precision oncology
treatments with improved outcomes tailored to individual glioma patients. We will perform three specific aims:
1) develop 1H-MRSI for intra-operative image guided surgical removal of gliomas, 2) develop 31P-MRSI at
ultra-high field to guide pharmacologic interventions in glioma, 3) clinical translation of multinuclear MRI for
treatment of glioma patients. There are strong rationales for the proposed research: 1) there is no alternative in
vivo imaging that is specific for IDH mutations, 2) MRSI is non-invasive and safe to scan without radiation and
tracer, 3) fast, 4) cost effective, 5) probes entire tumor and healthy brain without sampling bias of biopsies, 6)
can be performed pre-surgically and in inoperable patients. The approach is innovative because it employs the
first available whole-brain 2HG imaging at high resolution accelerated by deep learning compressed sensing,
novel receive-shim array hardware for 31P-MRSI to improve data quality, and automated high-throughput
processing by deep learning. The contribution of the proposed research will be significant because it will
provide clinicians a validated precision oncology imaging tool to select optimal treatment in glioma patients."
10824366,"Project Summary Abstract. NUT carcinoma (NC, formerly NUT midline carcinoma) is an aggressive
squamous carcinoma, affecting all ages, that is highly (>90%) lethal. The over-arching goal of this proposal is
to improve survival of these patients through mechanism-driven identification of key oncogenic targets. NC is
defined by NUTM1-fusion oncogenes, most commonly (~78%) encoding the BRD4-NUT protein. BRD4-NUT
drives NC growth through the blockade of differentiation and maintenance of proliferation by forming very large
(100kb-2MB), acetyl-histone-rich super-enhancers called megadomains (MD) that we described. MDs arise
from the recruitment of p300, a histone acetyl-transferase (HAT), by NUT to acetylated histones bound by the
dual bromodomains of BRD4, a BET family protein. We have shown that BRD4-NUT drives transcription of key
oncogenic targets through the additional recruitment of numerous transcriptional activators by BRD4.
 Our demonstration that treatment with BET bromodomain inhibitors (BETi) that competitively inhibit binding
of BET bromodomains to chromatin, can inhibit growth of NC in humans led to a new field investigating the role
of BRD4 in cancer. Unfortunately, the efficacy of BETi monotherapy is limited by toxicity.
 In this next phase, we are investigating novel oncogenic mechanisms whose targeting can synergize with
BETi therapeutically. Our preliminary data, together with what is established, has led us to formulate a
mechanistic two-domain model of how NC growth is epigenetically driven. The model will be tested in the aims
below with the overall goal of identifying a therapeutic combination of compounds optimized for maximally
selective, synergistic tumor inhibition with minimized toxicity. The model proposes that the first, transcriptionally
repressive domain formed by PRC2 enables NC growth by repressing the expression of pro-differentiation,
tumor suppressive genes (tested in aim 1).
 The second, physically separate permissive MD is comprised of BRD4-NUT-p300 bound to acetylated
histones that drive transcription of oncogenic genes. In this model, MD formation requires cooperative binding
of both BRD4-NUT bromodomains (BD1 and BD2) to acetylated histones (tested in aim 2); and the acetyl-
histone-permissive state that enables MD formation requires mono-methylation of H3K79 by DOT1L (aim 3).
Inhibition of both of these domains would 1. repress transcription of oncogenic genes, such as MYC, and 2. de-
repress transcription of genes critical for differentiation, senescence, and exit from cell cycle. Indeed, we have
found that co-inhibition of EZH2 and BRD4-NUT is synergistic in vitro and in vivo.
Specific Aim 1. Determine the oncogenic role of EZH2 in NUT carcinoma.
Specific Aim 2. Determine the oncogenic roles of BRD4 bromodomains 1 and 2 in NUT carcinoma.
Specific Aim 3. What is the role of DOT1L in BRD4-NUT megadomain formation and oncogenic
function?"

This is a competitive renewal application for a second term of this project (years 5-8).
Characterizing gene regulatory differences between humans and our close primate relatives is essential for
understanding the molecular basis of human-specific traits. Comparative genomics provides us with the tools to
identify both species-specific and conserved regulatory features, which has provided valuable insight into the genetic
architecture of adaptation in gene regulation. However, ethical and practical considerations preclude comparative
studies of molecular traits in live primates, particularly apes. Frozen post-mortem tissues from non-human apes are
difficult to obtain, and even when they are available, they are not optimal templates for many functional genomic
assays. Thus, we are generally unable to collect samples from enough individuals to map and study gene regulatory
loci in non-human apes; we are unable to study gene regulation in more than a few tissues from apes; we are unable
to study the dynamics of gene regulation during development; and we are unable to study regulatory responses to
evolutionarily and clinically relevant exposures.
In the first term of this project, we proposed to address this challenge by establishing a comparative panel of induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from humans and chimpanzees. We have successfully done this, and we have shared
these lines freely and without restriction with more than 30 labs (see letters of support), facilitating comparative
functional genomic studies by investigators who would not otherwise have been able to obtain appropriate samples
to conduct their research. We now request support to continue to maintain and distribute this community resource,
which we will expand in two ways. First, we will generate additional chimpanzee iPSC lines using the remaining
samples we collected prior to the moratorium on chimpanzee research. We expect that these lines will soon become
the only population-sample resource for future studies involving chimpanzees in the USA. Second, we will use
human and chimpanzee iPSCs to develop a series of dynamically differentiating organoids, which we will also share
freely to allow other groups to effectively utilize the comparative iPSC panel. The unique property of these
dynamically differentiating organoids is that they contain asynchronously differentiating cells. While they do not
produce pure cell populations that can be meaningfully analyzed with bulk RNA-seq data, single-cell RNA-seq can
be used to deconvolve the organoids into dozens of cell types and developmental stages, allowing us to explore
dynamic regulatory processes that cannot be observed in adult tissues10."
10851896,"Project Summary
The rise in an aging population plagued by obesity and diabetes mellitus is projected to render exponential
growth in diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Hence, therapeutic interventions that halt aging-related kidney changes
and DKD must be rigorously pursued. Maladaptive inflammation drives DKD onset, and proinflammatory
cytokines and chemokines activate macrophages leading to kidney infiltration and poor renal prognosis. Yet,
inflammation remains a major unaddressed injurious pathway in DKD. We and others demonstrated that
maladaptive inflammation in DKD patients and animal models is associated with increased cellular senescence
and kidney dysfunction. Thus, decreasing senescence through senotherapeutics, such as, small molecule drugs
or cell-derived components, may halt DKD and age-related kidney deterioration. Therefore, there is an urgent
need to develop a therapeutic armamentarium targeting the multifaceted pathogenesis (inflammation and cell
senescence) of DKD to extend healthy lifespan. We and others demonstrated that mesenchymal stromal cells
(MSCs) suppress inflammatory responses through secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing
biologically active cargo, primarily microRNAs (miRNAs), and reduce senescent burden and extend lifespan in
aging mouse models. Although the therapeutic activity of MSC-EVs has previously been assessed in aging and
inflammatory disease models, the effects of these biotherapeutics on inflammation and senescence in aging
DKD remain unexplored. Our preliminary results indicate that MSC-EVs: (i) reduce senescence pathways,
macrophage infiltration, and kidney injury in murine DKD and (ii) can be loaded with small molecule drugs for
combination therapy. Additionally, our recent study demonstrated, for the first time, that senolytic drugs, dasatinib
and quercetin, reduce senescent cell abundance in humans and improve kidney injury following senescent cell
clearance in mouse models. We hypothesize that EVs have anti-inflammatory and senotherapeutic effects in
aging DKD, that can be further enhanced by co-delivery of senolytic drugs. To address this central hypothesis,
we will determine the effects of EV miRNAs on senescence and inflammation in vitro (Aim 1), assess the effects
of EVs from several sources in a mouse model of aging DKD (Aim 2), and evaluate the performance of EVs as
drug delivery vehicles for dasatinib and quercetin (Aim 3). To ensure the technical success of this study, we
have assembled a team with complementary expertise in aging, DKD, extracellular vesicles, senolytics, and drug
delivery. Novel approaches encompassing unique EV sources, EV isolation methods, and immunoprofiling
technology will enhance knowledge of EV-mediated therapeutic mechanisms in DKD and may advance clinical
translation of EVs as novel senotherapeutics, delivery vehicles for senolytics, and/or combination therapies to
reduce inflammatory and senescence pathways in diabetic and age-related kidney dysfunction. These novel
therapeutics hold potential to alter disease trajectory and extend the healthy lifespan in those with aging DKD."
10837101,"The upper respiratory tract is the site of initial infection with respiratory viruses, such as influenza.
T cells and antibodies at this mucosal site form local immune memory and are positioned to
provide sterilizing immunity. Despite this known importance in preventing infections, mucosal
immunity is understudied relative to its peripheral blood counterpart. This has resulted in a weak
understanding of the contribution of mucosal immunity to preventing viral infection, and those
factors that could be enhanced in next-generation influenza vaccines. This proposal aims to
address two major technological limitations that have hindered our understanding of mucosal
immunity. Firstly, studies have suffered from a lack of well validated and consistently applied tools
for sampling the respiratory mucosa. Nasosorption is a minimally invasive, well tolerated,
sampling tool that yields highly reproducible data on the abundance of protein mediators in the
human nose. Here, nasosorption will be employed to collect respiratory secretions from healthy
control volunteers and analyzed alongside biobanked samples arising from human infection
challenge studies of influenza. This first aim seeks to demonstrate the utility of nasosorption as a
human nasal sampling tool that can bring a greater level of consistency to future immunology and
vaccine efficacy studies. Secondly, studies have suffered from an inability to determine the
functional activity of mucosal antibodies. This inability has arisen from the focus of research on
systemic immunity, where antibody titres are higher than in mucosal secretions. Existing
technologies such as haemagglutination inhibition, neutralization, and antibody-mediated
cytotoxicity assays are therefore either insufficiently sensitive or not optimized for use with
mucosal samples. To address this technology gap, this proposal aims to develop the use of
pseudovirus neutralization and FcγR-dimer binding assays to study the activity of mucosal
antibodies against influenza. These technologies are ideally suited to mucosal samples as they
have greater sensitivity than classical approaches and can be readily modified to study new
antigens as viruses evolve and vaccines emerge. Utilizing samples from human infection
challenge studies with wild-type (H1N1) influenza and vaccine-virus (LAIV) samples enables the
testing of these technologies in a tightly controlled setting and analysis of the homo- and hetero-
subtypic immune responses resulting from infection/vaccination. Finally, the robustness of the
developed technologies will be tested to enable widespread dissemination of the techniques,
enabling the understanding of mucosal immunity in future studies of influenza vaccines."
10904797,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) continues to be a major health problem with over 500,000 VTE events in the
US annually. Venous thromboembolism costs more than $8 billion per year to our health care system and causes
more than 100,000 deaths per year in the US alone. Venous thromboembolism is particularly problematic in
patients who experience trauma. Despite administration of chemoprophylaxis to trauma patients during
hospitalization, about 5% of patients still develop symptomatic VTE prior to discharge, and, more alarmingly, 40
- 60% of patients who develop symptomatic VTE, do so after discharge. An accurate assessment of traumatic-
injury based coagulopathies remains dependent on unavailable basic scientific knowledge needed to address
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) initiative of defining the “role of laboratory monitoring…to help better define
those at risk of bleeding and thrombosis.” To understand the etiologies of trauma-induced venous
thromboembolism, a comprehensive approach that assesses plasma coagulation factor activities, platelet
reactivity, and endothelial function within the context of pre-trauma patient characteristics (sex, BMI, smoking
etc.) and “real-time” blood studies at the time of trauma is required”. Obtaining integrated lab and clinical data
from a diverse trauma patient population is not readily feasible in a single investigator’s laboratory or site. The
long-term goal is to develop novel predictive, diagnostic and treatment strategies that identify “at risk” individuals
for VTE or bleeding soon after trauma. Our Central Hypothesis is that clinically significant thrombosis requires
the integrated dysregulation of NETosis, thrombin generation, endothelial injury, and von Willebrand factor-
platelet dysfunction. Our collaboration embodies all of the elements needed to improve the quality of care of
trauma patients. The investigators are from multiple health-related professions and this leverages experiences
and knowledge from different, but related disciplines. Our collaboration also encourages and fosters scientific
inquiry with the scientific expertise that will create and disseminate new knowledge and applications. Finally, the
team science approach that we have culminated is expected to provide for the highest quality of care and
improvement of trauma health outcomes."
10906819,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Corneal endothelial dystrophies are a common cause of vision loss and are characterized by a slowly
progressive, bilateral dysfunction of the corneal endothelium. The main therapeutic option to restore vision in
these patients remains corneal transplantation, as medical management is usually inadequate. Mutations in
the SLC4A11 gene are associated with several endothelial dystrophies, including Fuchs endothelial corneal
dystrophy (FECD), congenital hereditary endothelial corneal dystrophy (CHED), and Harboyan syndrome.
SLC4A11 is a transporter protein that functions to maintain osmotic balance in corneal endothelium, and many
point mutations in SLC4A11 found in disease lead to misfolding of the full-length protein. There is recent
evidence that assisting mutant SLC4A11 to regain proper folding is a promising therapeutic approach. A prior
small-scale, high throughput chemical screen identified the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug glafenine for
its ability to correct folding defects in misfolded SLC4A11, and following correction the mutant SLC4A11
protein regained functional activity. Though glafenine is not a candidate for clinical use due to anaphylaxis and
renal toxicity, its efficacy supports an approach using other small molecule folding correctors to repair defective
SLC4A11 in corneal endothelial dystrophies. Our long-term objective is to develop first-in-class therapeutics
for patients with vision impairment due to protein misfolding in the cornea. We propose to test the hypothesis
that compounds identified through phenotypic screening assays will promote the correct folding of mutant
SLC4A11 and restore corneal endothelial cell function. The goals of this proposal are to: Aim 1) Perform
focused screening to identify correctors of SLC4A11 folding; Aim 2) Perform large, unbiased chemical library
and genetic screening to identify novel targets and mechanisms; and Aim 3) Assess cytotoxic effects of
NSAIDs on corneal cells. Using advanced experimental methods, including high-content microscopy-based
screening assays and novel CRISPR-based genetic screens, the proposed studies will provide insight into the
correction of protein folding defects as a therapeutic strategy for corneal endothelial dystrophies. Results from
the study will be used to develop a new, non-surgical treatment option for patients with vision loss due to
corneal endothelial dystrophies and establish a novel therapeutic approach to corneal disease."

The goal of this proposal is to investigate the functional role of eosinophils in promoting tissue repair and
regeneration after hepatic ischemia and reperfusion (IR) injury. Hepatic IR injury, which occurs during
transplantation surgery, is a major factor contributing to acute liver dysfunction and long-term complications.
Timely and robust liver repair and regeneration is vital to the resolution and recovery from ischemic liver
damage. Thus, there is a critical need to identify key pro-reparative molecular and cellular mechanisms in
order to develop therapeutic strategies to improve the outcomes of liver surgery and transplantation.
Our preliminary data demonstrated that the peak of eosinophil accumulation in the liver after IR injury
coincided with the critical time point of liver repair and regeneration. Eosinophil-deficient mice exhibited
markedly delayed and impaired tissue repair after hepatic IR injury. In contrast, adoptive transfer of WT bone
marrow-derived eosinophils (bmEos) to eosinophil-deficient mice dramatically improved liver repair to a similar
rate and extent as in the WT mice. However, interleukin (IL)-4- and IL-13-deficient bmEos could not improve
liver repair. We also found reduced EGFR activation and lower levels of HB-EGF in eosinophil-deficient mice.
Together, these findings support our hypothesis that eosinophil-derived IL-4 and/or IL-13, through
inducing HB-EGF production, play an essential role in promoting tissue repair after hepatic IR injury.
We propose three Specific Aims to (1) Investigate the role of eosinophils in liver repair after IR injury, (2)
Elucidate the mechanism by which eosinophils promote liver repair after IR injury, and (3) Explore the
potential of targeting eosinophils to accelerate liver repair after IR injury."

TPI Df is a devastating untreatable childhood metabolic disease resulting in anemia,
paralysis, irreversible brain damage and premature death. Numerous subtle amino acid
substitutions in Triosephosphate Isomerase (TPI) are pathogenic and result in rapidly
progressing multisystem disease. Importantly, all known pathogenic TPI Df mutations result
in a protein that retains function and pathogenesis is known to result from increased
turnover of the functioning protein by Protein Quality Control pathways (PQC). We have
developed a human cellular TPI Df assay based on a cellular model of the “common” E104D
mutation and implemented it for high-content, high-throughput imaging. We have used this
model in a pilot screen and validated its utility to identify novel compounds that modulate
mutant TPI protein levels in human cells. We have developed the assay to full HTS
standards, and propose to screen the 225,000 member NIH MLSMR compound library to
identify hit-to-lead compounds to develop into TPI Df small molecule therapies. We will
validate hits in secondary assays for TPI stability and activity in TPI Df patient cells, prioritize
them in a panel of in vitro toxicology and metabolism assays, examine structure activity
relationships (SARs) of the lead compounds and substantially validate them in vivo using
established Drosophila and mouse models that reflect the entire range of TPI Df disease
severities. Overall, this project will discover initial therapies for development and test
efficacy of our lead compounds in TPI Df models, including a newly validated mouse model."

Over half a million children suffer from cerebral malaria annually, with up to 10-16% of this population
developing epilepsy within two years. Thus, cerebral malaria contributes significantly to the global epilepsy
burden. As in many acquired epilepsies, there remains an important gap in knowledge on how to identify
which children after cerebral malaria infection will be at risk for epilepsy development. Identification of
biomarkers heralding epilepsy risk would improve timely identification of who would most benefit from closer
clinical monitoring- a critical consideration for improved allocation of the limited available resources in
regions where this disease is most prevalent.
Identification of the specific clinical and electroencephalographic (EEG) metrics which confer risk of post-
malaria epilepsy will also importantly help understand epilepsy development in this disease. Studying these
processes in acquired epilepsies has proven difficult to date due to the varied nature of etiologies and
timing of epilepsy development after brain insult. Cerebral malaria has potential to be a unique model for
identification of epileptogenesis biomarkers, as it is a single disease state with a high rate of post-epilepsy
development within a relatively short time frame. This proposal will address key gaps in knowledge
regarding the utility of clinical and EEG metrics readily available in resource-limited settings for predictive
ability to prognosticate epilepsy risk in children with cerebral malaria. The findings have the potential to lay
the foundation for future research of targeted interventions directed toward reducing post-cerebral malaria
epilepsy development.
This Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award application aligns with two of the benchmarks
set by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and American Epilepsy Society, including
Area II- understanding epileptogenesis, and Area III- identify biomarkers. This proposal is also designed to
provide important opportunities for the training and career development of the candidate. Dr. Patel has
experience in global neurology research and clinical neurophysiology; this award will allow her to gain
further experience in clinical research methodology and specific training in computational analysis of EEG.
These skills will lay a foundation for further study of this condition and potentially in anti-epileptogenesis
trials of the post-cerebral malaria epilepsy model. Ultimately, this research proposal and the accompanying
training will provide a strong foundation for a successful independent research career devoted to the
understanding of epileptogenesis and reducing the risk of acquired epilepsies in children globally."

Each year ~1.5 million American women enter into the perimenopause, a neuroendocrine transition state unique
to the female. The mission of the Perimenopause in Brain Aging and Alzheimer’s disease (P3) is to discover
biological transformations in brain that occur during the perimenopausal transition that lead to endophenotypes
predictive of risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Herein, we focus on the neuro-immune system as a key driver of
chronological and endocrinological aging that occurs in the midlife female brain. Our goals are to identify the
mechanisms by which these transformations occur and to translate these discoveries into strategies to prevent
conversion to an at-Alzheimer's-risk phenotype. Project 3 contributes to achieving P3 goals by determining
peripheral immune signatures at each stage of midlife chronological and endocrinological aging, their
contribution to the development of an at-risk-for AD phenotype, and identifying therapeutic interventions for AD
in the context of autoimmune disease (AID). Observations suggest that augmented adaptive cellular immunity
contributes to neurodegenerative changes seen in AD, that these changes are exacerbated during the
perimenopausal transition. The overall hypothesis guiding Project 3 is that peripheral inflammation during mid-
life endocrinological changes contributes to the development of AD and neurodegeneration later in the life of
females. Aim characterizes peripheral immunophenotypes that emerge during the perimenopausal transition,
evaluates the link between autoimmune flares and menopause, and identifies existing therapies for autoimmune
disease that are effective at reducing the risk of developing AD. The goal of Aim 2 is to identify mechanisms by
which the genetic risk factors APOE4 and HLA-DRB1*1501 contribute to development of AD and AID
phenotypes during the perimenopausal transition. The objective of Aim 3 is to determine the contribution of
immune activation by B-cell antigen presentation to neurodegeneration using. This objective will be achieved by
evaluating immunophenotype and neurodegenerative changes resulting from immunization of mouse models
from Aim 2 with amyloid beta or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein. Outcomes of these studies will advance
our fundamental understanding of the role of systemic inflammation during perimenopause in the prodromal
neurodegenerative changes of AD and identify therapeutic interventions to reduce risk of AD in women with
autoimmune disorders (AID) who are already at higher risk of developing cognitive dysfunction.

10813765,"7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The chromatin landscape of eukaryotic cells is decorated with landmarks characterized by covalent
modifications and variant nucleoprotein structures. Some of these chromatin marks contribute to productive
transcription, while others are involved in the establishment and maintenance of silenced chromatin regions.
The fact that more than half of human cancers have mutations in genes encoding histones and chromatin
regulators underscores the importance of understanding the fundamental mechanism of chromatin remodeling
in cells. The canonical nucleosome, which has an inner core consisted of two copies each of histone H2A,
H2B, H3, and H4 and an outer DNA coil of 147 bp in length, represents the predominant packaging unit of
cellular chromatin. But emerging evidence suggests that nucleoproteins with alternative histone stoichiometries
and DNA wrapping configurations are present. These variant packaging units can significantly alter the
biophysical and biochemical properties of chromatin, potentially affecting a wide spectrum of nuclear functions.
 In the proposed studies, we focus on a nucleosome-like particle, called the R-octasome, in which its core
is made up of eight subunits of the arginine-rich histone H3 and H4 (without H2A and H2B). Although it has
been known for >40 years that R-octasomes can be assembled in vitro, the biological relevance is unknown.
Using new structural data of the R-octasome, we strategically placed cysteine probes in yeast H3 and showed
by site-directed crosslinking that structures specific to R-octasomes are present in yeast cells, providing the
first evidence that R-octasomes exist in vivo. To further study the nature of R-octasomes, in Aim 1, we propose
to develop a methodology to purify native R-octasomes from yeast that can be used for biochemical, genomic,
and structural studies. To study the biological roles of R-octasomes, in Aim 2, we will interrogate the role of R-
octasomes in telomeric gene silencing, as analysis of site-specific chemical mapping data suggest that R-
octasomes are linked to telomeres. In parallel, we will investigate how R-octasomes function as substrates of
ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers. Finally, in Aim 3, we will explore the role of R-octasomes in higher-
order chromatin organization, as our structural data suggest that R-octasomes can nucleate the concatenation
of additional H3 and H4 histones. Overall, the outcome of this research will give new insights into how
eukaryotes use the highly conserved H3 and H4 as multi-functional substrates to modulate genomic functions."

Each year, over 10 million people become sick with tuberculosis (TB), and around 1.4 million die from the
disease. Around 86% of people with TB live in middle-income countries, with a large proportion living in cities.
To substantially decrease the global burden of TB, it is necessary to ensure that people are diagnosed quickly
and treated successfully. Geographic barriers to accessing health services – such as living far from a health
center – can lead to poor health outcomes. However, there is limited knowledge about how geographic access
barriers impact TB diagnosis and treatment outcomes in middle-income country urban settings. Health facilities
are generally present in these settings, but people with TB, who are often socially and economically
disadvantaged, face barriers in accessing them. We also lack tools for designing and targeting interventions
that address access barriers and thus improve TB diagnosis and treatment. This proposal seeks to address
these knowledge gaps using the “5 A’s” conceptual framework, which describes five domains that drive health
care access: availability, accessibility, accommodation, affordability, acceptability. To help understand how
geographic accessibility barriers and other types of access barriers contribute to delayed TB diagnosis, we will
apply structural equation modeling and simulation methods to data from TB patient surveys based on the 5 A’s
framework. To help programs target interventions to communities that are most at risk for delayed TB
diagnosis and incomplete TB treatment, we will create community-level risk scores that incorporate measures
of geographic accessibility as well as socioeconomic and demographic census data. To help programs develop
effective treatment support interventions, we will conduct a discrete choice experiment to identify optimal
packages of interventions aimed at addressing different types of access barriers during treatment, assessing
how preferences differ among different demographic groups. This proposal is significant because the results
will help TB programs to identify interventions that would be most effective for improving TB diagnosis and
treatment, and target these interventions to the individuals and communities that need them most. This
proposal is innovative because prior quantitative TB research studies have not used a health care access
conceptual framework, structural equation modeling or conjoint analysis to understand how to address access
barriers, or community risk scores to target interventions. In the long term, this research will help TB programs
reduce delays to diagnosis and incomplete treatment rates, thus reducing the global burden of TB morbidity
and mortality."

Microbial plaque biofilms that form at and below the gum line are the perpetrators of periodontal diseases,
which are a class of diseases associated with non-resolving inflammation that results in soft and hard tissue
destruction. Periodontitis is characterized by an unending cycle of chronic inflammation which leads to tissue
destruction and prevents wound healing but cannot control the biofilms microbial dysbiosis. Under conditions
of systemic inflammation, these host factors are amplified leading to more severe and refractory periodontal
disease conditions. As such, periodontal diseases are affected by and can be risk factors for a number of systemic
health issues such as diabetes. Current treatment of periodontitis involves mechanical removal of supra- and
sub-gingival bacterial plaque and calculus and is often accompanied by the use of locally administered
adjunctive therapies aimed at restoring microbial homeostasis. Current adjunctive therapies do not address the
need to break the unending cycle of chronic inflammation and restore tissue homeostasis. Thus, there is a
profound need to develop an adjunctive therapeutic that: a) possesses broad-spectrum activity against biofilms
with minimal toxicity to mammalian cells; b) provides anti-inflammatory activity; and, c) promotes tissue
healing.
Due to its antibacterial and immunomodulatory functions, nitric oxide (NO) is an attractive adjunctive agent in
the treatment of periodontal diseases. In the proposed research program, we will synthesize, characterize and
evaluate nitric oxide-releasing hyaluronic acid (HA) as a multi-action NO-release system. Upon release, the
NO will serve as a broad-spectrum antibacterial and pro-wound healing agent. The macromolecule that remains
(HA) will then further serve to mitigate immunmodulation and wound healing. We will evaluate the efficacy
and associated mechanisms of this multi-action therapeutic (e.g., NO: antibacterial, HA and NO:
immunomodulatory, and NO and HA: pro-wound healing). We propose this approach will reduce the
frequency of and/or augment clinical interventions and promote improved resolution of disease. We aim to: 1)
synthesize nitric oxide-releasing hyaluronic acid nanomaterials and formulations, showing the influence of NO-
releasing HA on antibacterial and antibiofilm action, mammalian cell cytotoxicity, and inflammation in various
oral delivery formulations; 2) delineate the mechanisms modulating microbial dysbiosis, immune dysfunction
and tissue-stasis; and, 3) test in vivo therapeutic efficacy in preventing and/or halting periodontal disease
progression."

The general goal of the proposed research is to define the mechanistic underpinning for the synthetic lethality
network between a deficiency in homologous recombination (HR) and defects in single-strand annealing
(RAD52) or POLq-mediated end-joining (TMEJ). Exciting preliminary data revealed that BRCA2 and RAD52
delay the repair of S-phase-associated DNA double-stranded breaks (DSB) by TMEJ until M-phase. This
regulation avoids TMEJ-mediated chromosomal rearrangements of one-sided DSBs that are produced by
replication fork breakage. Our approach combines innovative cell cycle phase resolved imaging of DNA repair
proteins and DNA damage markers with mechanistic biochemical analysis using purified human proteins in
reconstituted reactions. Our results will have potential translational implications for the clinical application of
newly developed RAD52 and POLq inhibitors for the treatment of HR-deficient tumors with respect to application
protocols, patient selection, and use of DNA damage response checkpoint inhibitors as well as the response to
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibition.
The Specific Aims are:
1. Define the mechanism of action of BRCA2 in DSB repair pathway control. We will test the model that the
 DNA binding properties of BRCA2 are critical for TMEJ inhibition. In Aim 1A, we conduct foundational studies
 to determine the fundamental DNA binding properties of full-length BRCA2. In Aim 1B, we will define which
 domains of BRCA2 are required for TMEJ inhibition in cells. This combination of cell-based and biochemical
 studies will define the functions and regions of BRCA2 that are required for TMEJ inhibition.
2. Define the mechanism of TMEJ inhibition by BRCA2 and RAD52. BRCA2 and RAD52 employ two different
 modes to inhibit the DNA polymerase activity of POLq which may affect additional reaction steps in the TMEJ
 process. We will reconstitute TMEJ in vitro with purified proteins to determine the mechanisms by which
 BRCA2 (Aim 2A) and RAD52 (Aim 2B) inhibit TMEJ. We will test inhibition of the overall TMEJ reaction and
 individual steps including 1) DNA binding, 2) end-alignment, and 3) DNA synthesis. Analysis of wild type and
 catalytic mutants of POLq will be conducted in vitro and in cells.
3. Define which HR defects are susceptible to RAD52 loss of function. It is an open question whether loss
 of RAD52 will lead to POLq-mediated chromosome fusions and lethality in all HR-deficient backgrounds (Aim
 3A) or all BRCA2 mutants (Aim 3B). Our preliminary studies suggest a model that loading of BRCA2 is the
 critical step to limit TMEJ to M-phase and that HR defects past this step are not affected by RAD52 inhibition."
10827971,"Project Summary / Abstract
Mutagenesis resulting from replication failure is a direct cause of tissue dysfunction and cancer when it occurs
in somatic tissues and of de novo and inherited genetic diseases when it occurs in gametogenic stem cells or
meiosis. A primary mutagenic outcome of replication failure is structural variant (SV) formation, especially copy
number variants (CNVs), which create large changes in genomic content in single mutational steps. Fundamental
gaps in knowledge exist regarding the DNA repair mechanisms that lead to SV formation. While multiple
mechanisms may be involved, models that derive from template switching, break-induced replication (BIR), and
other forms of double-strand break (DSB) repair have been forwarded to account for a large proportion of human
CNVs but lack direct experimental evidence. Our prior work has shown that incomplete replication leads to a
high frequency of CNVs in human cells, with hotspots in large, transcribed genes corresponding to common
fragile sites (CFSs) that provide a model system for characterizing SV formation mechanisms.
 Recent literature has revealed much about the damage response pathways that promote proper completion
of replication. One finding was Mitotic DNA Synthesis (MiDAS), where failed replication in S is rescued by a
conservative form of replication activated as late as mitosis. As a BIR-like pathway, MiDAS accuracy is thought
to be low such that the temporal association between MiDAS and CFS expression suggests a potential
mechanistic link to SV formation. Our major goals are to explore the relationships between replication rescue,
end-joining, BIR, other forms of DSB repair, and SV formation, how CFS expression relates to CNV formation,
and how extensible observations at CFS/CNV hotspot loci are to SV formation genome wide. Our central
hypothesis is that hotspot CNV formation occurs during replication rescue, either via MiDAS or an alternative
pathway to MiDAS, notably, theta-mediated end joining (TMEJ). A driving rationale is that we must monitor SV
formation in real time as a primary experimental outcome, something we have been uniquely dedicated to doing.
Our approach will therefore apply our recent technology advances for directly detecting rare SV junctions in
experimental samples to provide answers to longstanding questions about the origins of human SVs.
 We will address our goals through three specific aims to (1) Identify the precise cell cycle stage(s) when
structural variants form following replication stress; (2) Establish the replication rescue and DNA repair pathways
that create structural variant junctions; and (3) Extend mitotic SV formation mechanisms from CFSs to the whole
genome and BRCA2 deficiency. The combination is significant as it will provide direct experimental tests of the
mechanisms that execute SV formation in at-risk genomic loci and extend those findings to multiple genomic
regions and cell lineages relevant to both somatic and heritable germline mutagenesis."
10829475,"Project Summary/Abstract
Voice disorders have been estimated to affect approximately 30% of the adult population in the United States at
some point in their lives with the most prevalent being associated with vocal hyperfunction. Phonotraumatic vocal
hyperfunction (PVH) is associated with the formation of benign vocal fold lesions (e.g., nodules and polyps).
Vocal hyperfunction is also associated with dysphonia that occurs in the absence of concurrent vocal fold trauma
or other structural/neurological abnormalities (e.g., muscle tension dysphonia), which is referred to as non-
phonotraumatic vocal hyperfunction (NPVH). Unfortunately, the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of these
hyperfunctional voice disorders continue to be hampered by limited knowledge of the etiological and
pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie specific voice disorders within the broad range of those associated
with vocal hyperfunction.
This project continues to elucidate multiple factors/mechanisms that are assumed to play important roles in
causing and maintaining hyperfunctional voice disorders using a combination of data from ambulatory voice
monitoring and other important sources: reflux status, personality, vocal reactivity to environmental sound levels,
responses to voice therapy and ambulatory biofeedback, assessment of auditory-motor deficits, and model-
generated estimates of phonatory physiological parameters that are difficult/impossible to measure clinically.
Research during this second grant cycle will focus on the interrelated goals of further improving the detection of
PVH and NPVH and identifying clinically meaningful subgroups (phenotypes) within these two broad categories.
Detection will be improved by developing two new ambulatory measures, energy dissipation dose (EDD), which
is expected to be more sensitive to mild (early-stage) phonotrauma, and a time series voicing-resting ratio (VRR)
that will provide objective insight into how the relationship between vocal load and recovery is associated with
phonotrauma and vocal fatigue. A combination of advanced statistical and machine learning approaches will be
applied to our growing comprehensive/multidimensional voice database to optimize the discovery of PVH and
NPVH subgroups based on differences in objective measures of daily (ambulatory) vocal behavior and phonatory
pathophysiology. The subgroups will be further differentiated by additional measures that reflect deeper insights
into pathophysiological mechanisms (e.g., intrinsic laryngeal muscle activation levels, vocal fold collision
pressure, etc.) and potential predisposing factors (e.g., personality, reflux, etc.).
Achieving the goals of this research program will lead to improved prevention, differential diagnosis, and more
focused and efficient treatment of these highly prevalent voice disorders."
10852889,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in both men and women in the United States. Lung
cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (CT) has been shown to reduce lung cancer mortality.
However, current radiology practice still suffers from (1) high rates of missed tumors and (2) imprecise lung
nodule characterization (malignant vs. benign). Artificial intelligence (AI) based computer aided diagnosis (CAD)
systems have helped radiologists to reduce the missed-tumor rates moderately, but have not been widely
adopted for three key reasons: lack of efficiency, lack of real-time collaboration, and lack of interpretability. The
overall goal of this proposal is to create radiologist-centered artificial intelligence algorithms that are both
interpretable and collaborative and to demonstrate their improved efficacy via lung cancer screening
experiments. The central hypothesis of this effort is that the creation of an AI based virtual cognitive assistant
(VCA) will provide a better understanding of cognitive biases while offering interpretable feedback to radiologists
for an improved screening experience with higher diagnostic accuracy, reproducibility, and efficiency.
 Specific aims of the proposal are three-fold. Aim 1: To develop an eye-tracking platform that offers a
realistic radiology reading room experience while extracting gaze patterns from radiologists. This will facilitate
addressing the problem of true collaboration between radiologists and CAD. Radiologists will perform their
screening without any constraints (e.g., wearing glasses) while their gaze patterns and other human-computer
interaction events are tracked, processed, and stored in real time. Aim 2: To develop an automated real-time
collaborative system involving a developed VCA and the radiologist to synergistically improve detection and
diagnostic performances. Using deep learning (DL) algorithms, the VCA will embody a powerful visual attention
model to represent radiologists’ gaze, visual search, and fixation patterns, and will be composed of a detection
component and a diagnostic component. A deep reinforcement learning algorithm will enable communication
between the VCA and the radiologist. Lastly, a DL-based segmentation component will, on the fly, enable the
VCA to derive and visualize quantitative measures (HU statistics, volume, long/short axes lengths, etc.) and
overlay them along with the tumor classification label (benign/malignant) and its probability in real time. Aim 3:
To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed VCA via lung cancer screening experiments involving six radiologists
from two institutes (University of Pennsylvania and NIH) at different expertise levels.
 The proposed VCA is a first-of-a-kind-system to exploit the synergy between powerful DL technology and
experts (humans) to attempt boost clinical diagnostic performance of radiologists, unlike passive DL techniques
that learn from labeled data. The outcome of this research are expected to be transformative by providing deep
insights for re-designing current CAD systems to truly collaborate with radiologists, instead of acting as second
opinion tools for them or replacing them, and by ultimately further reducing lung cancer-related deaths."

Preserved language function is essential to quality of life. For patients with a brain tumor near putative language
cortex, neurosurgeons may use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) presurgical language mapping to
assess and mitigate the risks of surgery-induced permanent language deficits. Critical barriers to clinical
deployment of presurgical fMRI are that 1) The validity of conventional fMRI is contingent on the patient’s ability
to perform precisely timed phonological and semantic tasks. But up to 50% of patients assigned to fMRI have
language or other cognitive deficits that affect task performance and may invalidate the mapping. 2) Expertise
in administering language tasks is insufficient in many clinical settings. To tackle these challenges, we propose
a single-group clinical trial to test movie fMRI (in which subjects watch short movie clips while being scanned)
as a novel diagnostic intervention for language mapping in neurosurgical patients. Our primary hypothesis is that
movie-watching relative to task-based and resting-state fMRI can provide comprehensive language mapping in
a greater number of neurosurgical patients, especially those with language deficits. Compared to conventional
fMRI language mapping tasks, movie-watching is predicted to engage more completely the neural networks
supporting language in real life. Movie-watching also improves subject compliance in fMRI scanning. Our
preliminary results demonstrate reduced in-scanner head motion, higher mapping sensitivity in receptive
language areas, and overall higher language mapping specificity, of movie versus conventional task fMRI, in
brain tumor patients undergoing presurgical language mapping (n=34). In this project, Aim 1 will evaluate in
individuals with stroke-induced aphasia (n=80) and healthy controls (n=40), the comprehension and expression
elicited by movie-watching versus conventional paradigms, as a function of language impairment. We predict
that language performance will be comparable, and in most individuals with aphasia superior, for movie-watching
relative to the other paradigms. Aim 2 will assess in neurologically-healthy subjects (n=40), the quality of movie
fMRI language mapping as a function of movie clip, and relative to conventional paradigms, using indices of
language localization sensitivity and specificity, hemispheric lateralization, and proximity to language white-
matter tracts. We predict that for clips inducing the most sensitive and specific synchronized fMRI activation,
movie-fMRI will produce better language mapping quality indices than the other paradigms. Aim 3 will similarly
evaluate movie-fMRI in neurosurgical patients with frontal or temporoparietal gliomas (n=80), as a function of
baseline language function, against the gold standard intra-operative electrocortical stimulation language
mapping, and relative to post-operative language outcome. We predict that movie-fMRI will produce better
language mapping in a large proportion of patients, especially those with language deficits. Study materials will
be publicly released, including optimal movie clips for certain language deficits and fMRI analysis routines."
